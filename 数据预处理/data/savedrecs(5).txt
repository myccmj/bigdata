AB The driver state monitoring is becoming one of the research hotspots in the field of traffic and vehicle safety, which can ensure driving safety by monitoring the driver's state. Therefore, this work makes an attempt to recognize driver's mental load and emotional states. However, the reliability and accuracy of driver status detection largely depend on the extracted features and the detection algorithm. The existing methods mainly improve accuracy by increasing the number of features, but for the problem with limited training samples, the increase in features may lead to an increase in model variance, and resulting in overfitting. In addition, single -model based methods may fall into local optimal solutions when performing local search. To alleviate these, we firstly propose an RFE-SHAP algorithm that improves the recursive feature elimination algorithm by using the Shapley Additive exPlanning value, and paired it with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to screen out the subset of features that best represent the driver's mental load and emotional state. Secondly, we proposed a multilayer stacking ensemble learning method based on different optimal feature subsets to further improve the accuracy of the driver's mental load and emotional state recognition. For each base models used for integration learning, the corresponding optimal feature subsets are selected using the RFE-SHAP algorithm, and then the different optimal feature subsets are combined with multilayer stacking ensemble learning. The vali -dation via experimental data demonstrates that the XGBoost-RFE-SHAP algorithm achieves superior model performance with fewer feature combinations than the classic algorithm. The proposed driver state detection model based on multiple optimum feature subsets and multilayer stacking integration methods would more accurately identify the driver's mental load and emotional state than the single model, commonly used machine learning and integrated learning algorithms.

AB In pursuit of a sustainable and ecologically conscious future, as enhancing railway infrastructure became spe-cifically important, strategic positioning of railway stations is a growing concern for regulatory authorities. Strategic positioning is a complex problem and requires comprehensive approach. Multifaceted parameters such as proximity to production centers, integration with port facilities and transport networks, transportation infrastructure quality, and railway capacity should be taken into account. This study aims to analyze the decision-making process in strategic positioning of railway stations. To this end, the problem is formalized in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) context. Spatial data, statistical insights, and expert opions are used to form evaluation criateria. Then, a novel model, Fuzzy Dombi Bonferroni Weighted Assessment (DOBAS) is introduced so that Geographic Information System (GIS) outputs can be considered together with capacity cal-culations. After the challenges of the model are solved and sensitivity analysis are done, it is demonstarted in a case of one of the most logistically dense regions of Turkey to show that the model provides an efficient way of prioritizing a freight corridor. Outcomes show that geographical locations, easiness of integration to the existing transportation system and complemantary sectors in the neighborhood are effective. Results are extended and discussed to reach policy implications for regulatory authorities.

AB Blooming social media platforms provide breeding ground for health rumors. Despite the establishment of accounts by numerous organizations to counter health rumors, the effectiveness of these endeavors exhibits considerable variability. Thus, there exists a pressing need to refine the framework and operation of rumor -refutation accounts. Aiming at enhancing the proficiency of accounts in refuting health rumors on social media platforms and exploring the factors affecting it, this paper proposes a novel group multi-criteria sorting approach integrating social network analysis (SNA) to classify accounts' health rumor-refutation ability. To commence, an evaluation indicator system for accounts' health rumor-refutation ability is established using SNA. Subsequently, the indicator values are computed, incorporating methods such as triangular fuzzy number (TFN), a lite bert (ALBERT) pre-trained language model, and PageRank. Furthermore, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) and triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number (TIFN) are used to determine the expert weights and indicator weights. After that, on the basis of original best worst method-sort (BWM-Sort), classification boundaries are discovered creatively using optimal clustering (OC), and minimum discrimination information (MDI) is adopted as the objective function for priority assignment. Consequently, an OC-MDI-BWM-Sort method is newly proposed which offers distinct advantages in computational efficiency, information integration, decision-making objectivity, and result effectiveness. Lastly, regarding to four cases of widely circulated rumors, health rumor-refutation ability of 35 accounts on Weibo platform is classified using the proposed method. The findings underscore that merely 8.57% of accounts exhibit stable and good health rumor-refutation ability, while up to 28.57% and 80.00% display poor and inconsistent ability in certain instances. Tailored to accounts with excellent or good, satisfactory or fair, and poor health rumor-refutation ability, respectively, managerial suggestions are provided regarding information expression standards, account operator proficiency, and account cooperation, and all accounts are advised to watch audience behavior.

AB In recent years, numerous meta-heuristic algorithms based on swarm intelligence have been proposed and widely popularized. Although algorithms are designed by some specific behaviors of organisms, their heuristic paradigms and constructed modules are similar, resulting in algorithms still suffer from imbalance between exploration and exploitation for complex optimization problems. Combining mathematical properties with a stochastic search process in meta-heuristic algorithms contributes to breaking the traditional single/dual population-based evolutionary paradigm and facilitating individuals forward optimization. Taking this as motivation, this article proposes a novel mathematics-based meta-heuristic algorithm, named Triangulation Topology Aggregation Optimizer (TTAO), for solving continuous optimization and engineering applications. The core of the proposed algorithm is based on similar triangular topology in mathematics. The TTAO algorithm contains two strategies, i. e., the generic aggregation and the local aggregation, which contributes to iteratively constructing multiple similar triangular topological units to balance the exploration and exploitation. The former generates new vertexes through positive information exchange between different triangular topological units. And the latter constructs new units at promising locations according to the local optimum vertex of each unit. The performance of the TTAO algorithm is evaluated in comparison with some competitive algorithms on CEC2017 functions for different dimensions and 8 real-world engineering problems. Moreover, the Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the TTAO algorithm, compared with 10 competitors, obtains 23, 23, and 22 best average results for 29 CEC2017 functions on 30, 50 and 100 dimensions, and its Wilcoxon rank sum test scores still rank first on three different dimensional cases. And more numerical results verify the outstanding optimization performance of the TTAO algorithm effectively. Source codes of TTAO are publicly available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13 6029-triangulation-topology-aggregation-optimizer.

AB Acoustic scene classification (ASC) has gained significant interest recently due to its diverse applications. Various audio signal processing and machine learning methods have been proposed for ASC. The volume and scope of ASC publications covering theories, algorithms, and applications have also been expanded. However, no recent comprehensive surveys exist to collect and organize the knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and its applications. To fill this gap, we present an up-to-date overview of ASC methods, covering earlier works and recent advances. In this work, we first define a general framework for ASC, starting with a historical review of previous research in the ASC field. Then, we review core techniques for ASC that have achieved good performance. Focus on machine learning based ASC systems, this work summarizes and groups the existing techniques in terms of data processing, feature acquisition, and modeling. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the available resources for ASC research and analyze ASC tasks in Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenges. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current ASC algorithms and open challenges to possible future developments toward practical applications of ASC systems.

AB RV reducer operating conditions are complex, often with low speed, reciprocating, non-integral cycle and other characteristics, coupled with the RV reducer itself complex structure and fault signal instantaneous, so the fault signal sample is small, which brings challenges to the bearing fault diagnosis of RV reducer. Therefore, an improved DNCNN denoising algorithm is proposed to realize the failure mode recognition of RV reducer. The algorithm improves the basic unit module (Conv(3*3) + BN + Relu) in DNCNN network, which can effectively solve the problem that the stacking of convolutional blocks leads to a large number of network parameters, makes the training time long, and most of the training parameters are concentrated in a certain layer of the network. The SE attention module is introduced to avoid the problem that the CNN model cannot effectively highlight the key points when extracting features. At the same time, the Swish activation function is used to replace the Relu activation function, which improves the phenomenon that the latter cannot learn the value of the function input less than 0, and the parameters cannot be updated. Based on improving the DNCNN denoising algorithm, the neural network fault diagnosis method of the main bearing state of the three RV reducers after denoising is studied, and the CBAM attention mechanism module is added to the network to obtain the InceptionV4-CBAM network model. Multiple sets of experimental analysis show that the failure mode recognition rate of the main bearing of the RV reducer under noise interference by the Improved DNCNN combined with InceptionV4-CBAM is 97.3 %.

TI SRSCL: A strong-relatedness-sequence-based fine-grained collective

ID KNOWLEDGE GRAPH; FRAMEWORK
AB The development of efficient methods for mining information from heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has become essential for improving the accuracy of collective entity linking in the absence of third-party knowledge bases. Currently, there remain three major challenges in the latest research: (1) The objective function of collective entity linking does not fully embrace the concept of "collective linking". (2) The objective function employs the mean value rather than the maximum value of the entity relatedness as a link parameter, while discounting the importance of the strong logical associations between the text and language for meaning recognition. (3) The objective function utilizes only one type of 2-hop path to contribute to entity relatedness, thereby disregarding other types of 2-hop path that exist in actual HINs. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a strong-relatedness-sequence-based fine-grained collective entity linking method (SRSCL). The SRSCL is capable of capturing the contextual information of the entity in the HINs, thereby providing improved accuracy in entity linking. Specifically, SRSCL constructs a knowledge representation learning model and proposes an overall semantic similarity model for entity mentions and candidate entities to solve the objective function and thereby reflect the idea of "collective linking". Additionally, a strong-relatednesssequence-based overall relatedness measurement model is proposed for candidate entities to emphasize the strong logical associations between them. Furthermore, SRSCL defines three types of 2-hop path and evaluates the importance of each path to accurately measure the relatedness of entities. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRSCL is more effective in capturing the overall relatedness of entities than the latest model. Particularly, when the number of entity mentions contained in one sliding window is greater than 6, the proposed SRSCL improves the precision, recall and F1 score by more than 10% compared with the latest model.

AB Studies on understanding the regional seismological differences based on the variations in the characteristics of the ground motion waves recorded during seismic events have provided independent insights into the different seismic environments of the world. This study aims to showcase the differences between three of the major seismic environments of the world including Japanese subduction, Chilean subduction, and Californian crustal. The study is based on developing deep learning (DL)-based surrogate generalized ground motion models (GGMMs) and analyzing them to understand the patterns between the earthquake source parameters and the resulting ground motion waveforms' engineering characteristics. The GGMMs are developed using long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are trained using six earthquake source and site parameters as the inputs and a 25 x 1 vector of amplitude-, duration-, and energy-based ground motion intensity measures (IMs). The GGMMs are trained and evaluated using carefully selected large datasets of ground motion records from the Japanese subduction, Chilean subduction, and Californian crustal sources (similar to 2000 records from each source). The models are developed in two settings: i) three independent GGMMs using the three datasets of each source, ii) one combined GGMM using the combined dataset. While the former provides individual surrogate models of the regional seismic environments and allows relative comparison among the three environments, the latter acts as a global seismic surrogate model and allows comparison in absolute terms. The seismic environments are investigated by analyzing the two types of GGMMs using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and game theory based Shapley explanations (SHAP). As the direct physical study of the seismic environments is not generally feasible/practical, the proposed GGMMs surrogating the process becomes a source of knowledge. By interpreting them, inferences about the seismic environments are derived. Results indicate the peculiar nature of the earthquakes arising from the three seismic backgrounds, further emphasizing the importance of conducting independent regional seismic hazard and risk analysis. In particular, the role of magnitude and rupture distance is observed to have a significantly different impact on the different IMs of the three different environments. The study further sets a novel basis to utilize advanced DL and XAI methods in understanding convoluted physics and engineering phenomena.

AB In two-sided markets, user fairness concerns affect a platform's operational decisions. By constructing a hotelingbased pricing model of platforms, this study explored the impact of fairness concerns on pricing, matching, and profits in competitive two-sided markets. The conclusion of the findings of this study is that the platform will perform tilted pricing when only one side of the user conducts fairness concern behavior. Meanwhile, the difference in the platform's pricing for bilateral users depends on the size of their "entry value" and the platform charges lower prices to users who bring them greater value. When both of the bilateral users conduct fairness concerns behaviors, the platform will capture and exploit the "disparity" mentality to obtain higher pricing power. The matching rate of the platform is affected whenever users exhibit fairness concern behaviors. Furthermore, the platform's matching rate is lower when only one user has a higher fairness concern. Contrary to the traditional view that fairness concerns harm a platform's profit, our findings reveal the mechanism by which unit surplus and fairness concerns jointly affect a platform's profit. The results of our analysis demonstrate that platform operations managers can perform pricing by fully utilizing the fairness concerns of bilateral users.

AB There have been limited research studies on encryption algorithms specifically designed for certain encryption scenarios. Aiming at different types of face images, this paper presents a multiple face images encryption algorithm based on a new non-adjacent coupled mapping lattice with dynamic parameter (NCMLP). NCMLP has a more comprehensive parameter range, better chaos, and more complex dynamic behavior Compared to classical non-adjacent coupled lattice mapping, which is suitable for encryption. The encryption algorithm firstly uses face detection technology to extract multiple face information and to generate a double-layer key, then scrambles the face information by three-dimensional bit-level cyclic shift, and finally encrypts the global information using 3D pixel level scrambling and 3D double index diffusion. It is worth mentioning that the algorithm has high security and can be applied to ordinary images. The experimental results and safety analysis show that the information entropy can exceed 7.9992, the histogram variance can be less than 1072, the pixel number change rate can reach 99.6323%, and the unified average change intensity can reach 33.5495%, all of which are very close to the ideal values.

AB The Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm (MQHOA) is a novel heuristic optimization technique, underpinned by the quantum wave function as its theoretical foundation. In this study, we present a streamlined MQHOA framework, dubbed the Bare-Bones Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm (BBMQHOA). This minimalist paradigm employs the most rudimentary free particle in quantum mechanics to simulate particle movement. BBMQHOA leverages group stability over individual stability, enabling the algorithm to fully capitalize on population data, thereby enhancing exploration and exploitation. An extensive array of experiments is carried out on a collection of 24 benchmark functions and a pair of real-world applications to validate the efficacy of our suggested methodology. The outcomes reveal that its performance is both practical and competitive while simultaneously maintaining user-friendliness.

ID PROGNOSTICS
AB Machinery prognostics and health management (PHM) plays a key role in the reliable and efficient operation of industrial processes. With the emerging big data era, data-driven prognostic methods which avoid considering complicated system models have attracted growing research interest. Among many data-driven models, similarity-based prediction methods have been popular due to their strong interpretability and relatively simple implementation process. Nevertheless, when quantifying the similarity between two trajectories, most existing similarity measures neglect the nonlinearity of the distance measurement at different degradation stages and degradation alignments with timing difference, which may not be sufficient to retrieve the most suitable trajectories for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. To overcome these limitations, a spherical-Dynamic Time Warping (spherical-DTW) algorithm is put forward to find an optimal match between the test and training trajectories at the retrieval step. Dynamic Time Warping allows degradation alignments with timing difference through stretching or compressing the trajectories with regard to time, thereby the data in similar degradation levels can be well aligned across different units. Moreover, a newly defined nonlinear spherical distance method is introduced and incorporated into the retrieval process to account for the nonlinearity of the damage propagation process. The significance of this study is that the newly proposed spherical-DTW algorithm goes one step further to consider the nonlinearity of fault evolutions and allow degradation pattern alignments with timing difference when performing similarity-based prognostics. Two run-to-failure cases, involving a real-world industrial compressor failure case and a gas turbine engine failure dataset, are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB Condition monitoring is essentially a complex multi-classification task that requires struggling with multiple conditions and imbalanced data. To address this issue, this study proposes a hierarchical cognition method that utilizes multi-entropy feature representation to capture the state of equipment under complex working conditions. Firstly, this study proposes a feature modeling method for mechanical equipment based on multi-entropy space, utilizing the cloud model as a space component. Secondly, the study uses multi-entropy feature data to develop a hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM) fault identification model for complex working conditions and data imbalance inspired by human hierarchical cognitive behavior. The feature data are decomposed into four levels, namely speed, load, abnormality, and fault, respectively. Additionally, a hierarchical feature selection mechanism is designed to improve the efficiency of HELM. Finally, comparative experiments are carried out on two platforms. Experiments show that the If factors of the two datasets in the multientropy space reach 0.6888 and 10.4881, respectively. At the same time, in the classification experiment for the imbalanced data, the classification accuracy reaches 90.68 when the fault samples are 10. The results show that the multi-entropy feature created in this study has a specific representation ability for mechanical states. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical extreme learning method can effectively identify faults under multiple conditions and data imbalance backgrounds.

AB Improper sorting of construction , demolition waste (CDW) leads to significant environmental and economic implications, including inefficient resource use and missed recycling opportunities. To address this, we developed a machine-learning-assisted procedure for recognizing CDW fragments using an RGB camera. Our approach uniquely leverages selected feature extraction, enhancing classification speed and accuracy. We employed three classifiers: convolutional neural network (CNN), gradient boosting (GB) decision trees , multi-layer perception (MLP). Notably, our method's extraction of selected features for GB and MLP outperformed the traditional CNN in terms of speed and accuracy, especially for challenging samples with similar textures. Specifically, while convolution resulted in an overall accuracy of 85.9%, our innovative feature extraction approach yielded accuracies up to 92.3%. This study's findings have significant implications for the future of CDW management, offering a pathway for efficient and accurate waste sorting, fostering sustainable resource use, and reducing the environmental impact of CDW disposal. Supplementary materials, including datasets, codes, and models, are provided, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

AB Compositional data (CoDa) is a type of relative data reflecting the proportion of different units in an integrated system, which can reveal the internal structure of observed objects and has been widely used to analyze practical economic and management problems. However, the summation constraint limits the prediction of compositional data time series. Especially, with small samples and poor information characteristics of the data set, the difficulties are further exacerbated. Compared with real-valued time series analysis, fuzzy time series (FTS) mainly transforms initial observed data to be different status so that the historical evolution rules can be derived. As a result, forms of initial observed data can be concealed. Correspondingly, this paper aims to establish a multi-rule combination prediction of compositional data based on a multivariate fuzzy time series model, named GA-CoDa-MFTS. Firstly, with the interaction of components, the adjustment rules between components are explored by using the fuzzy logical relationship (FLR). Secondly, the Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal weight of the predicted values under different rules and derive the combined predicted values. Finally, the prediction effectiveness of the model is verified by CRMSE and CMAPE through a numerical study.

AB Effective communication in complex networks is crucial for users and organizations, so graph theory is being used to provide solid groundwork for modeling and evaluating these networks. However, users often need help with group splits and communication issues due to ineffective community models. In addressing these limitations, this study proposed a community discovery technique based on Community Detection on Multi layer Graph using Intra-layer and Inter-layer Linkage Graphs (CDMIILG) to model multiple user relationships. The CDMIILG technique adopts centrality measures, depth-first search models, recursive and transitivity, with the latter playing significant roles in the network. The practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method were evaluated using modern centrality measures and a graph-based machine-learning approach. The model's performance was evaluated utilizing notable clustering metrics, including Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Modularity Approach, and Statistical Metrics, on seven real-world data sets. The study findings revealed that the proposed model is more effective than existing models for multi-layer graphs by yielding a 2%-7% increment.

AB Electroencephalogram (EEG) could directly reflect human brain activities. Recently, EEG-based emotion recognition technology has attracted widespread attention. However, although most of the existing methods can extract temporal and spatial features of EEG signals, the extraction process of the time-series information and spatial features is separate from each other. Some spatial features may be lost when extracting time -series information, and vice versa. Additionally, the non-Euclidean representations between the EEG electrodes cannot be ignored. In response to these issues, we construct a convolutional gated recurrent unit-driven multidimensional dynamic graph neural network (CGRU-MDGN), which mines its local spatial characteristics of EEG signals while learning the temporal information and captures non-Euclidean spatial features between EEG channels to classify emotions more accurately. Specifically, we substitute the fully connected layers of the GRU with convolution layers, which can take into account both the local spatial features and time-series information of EEG signals. Next, multiple non-Euclidean spatial representations are generated using multidimensional dynamic graph convolution. Furthermore, the characteristics of different dimensions or views are merged through the adaptive-weighted summation technique to realize the maximized feature extraction as much as possible. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the constructed CGRU-MDGN could achieve competitive recognition results on subject-independent emotion recognition tasks.

AB Probabilistic load forecasting has gained widespread attention for its effectiveness in providing scientific power dispatch plans in recent years. Most existing works adopted decomposition strategies to handle the temporal features of load data, but ignored the fact that decomposition components have different levels of importance, resulting in the incomplete extraction of temporal correlation information. Moreover, previous works have primarily concentrated on the geographical correlation among neighboring load zones and overlooked the semantic correlation among load zones, resulting in insufficient extraction of spatial correlation information. In this study, a novel multi-scaled self-attention-enhanced graph convolutional network with improved Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on Loess (STL) decomposition (MSGCN-ISTL) is proposed for probabilistic load forecasting. First, an improved STL decomposition is proposed, which adopts a convolutional neural network with dual convolutional channels to separately handle the different decomposition components, thus improving the extraction of temporal correlation information. Second, a new multi-scaled self-attention-enhanced graph convolutional network is proposed to extract the spatial correlation information from geographical and semantic aspects simultaneously, which enriches the receptive fields and extracts the multi-scaled enhanced spatial features. Experimental results conducted under various conditions demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed model.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is currently seeing tremendous growth due to new technologies and big data. Research in the field of IoT security is an emerging topic. IoT networks are becoming more vulnerable to new assaults as a result of the growth in devices and the production of massive data. In order to recognize the attacks, an intrusion detection system is required. In this work, we suggested a Deep Learning (DL) model for intrusion detection to categorize various attacks in the dataset. We used a filter-based approach to pick out the most important aspects and limit the number of features, and we built two different deep-learning models for intrusion detection. For model training and testing, we used two publicly accessible datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB 15. First, we applied the dataset on the Deep neural network (DNN) model and then the same dataset on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model. For both datasets, the DL model had a better accuracy rate. Because DL models are opaque and challenging to comprehend, we applied the idea of explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide a model explanation. To increase confidence in the DNN model, we applied the explainable AI (XAI) Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME ) method, and for better understanding, we also applied Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP).

AB Feature selection (FS) is a crucial process that aims to remove unnecessary features from datasets. It plays a role in data mining and machine learning (ML) by reducing the risk associated with high-dimensional datasets. FS is considered a challenging problem that is difficult to solve efficiently due to its combinatorial nature. As the size of the problem increases, the computation time also grows. Recently, researchers have focused on metaheuristic FS algorithms specifically designed for high-dimensional datasets. Therefore, this article proposes a powerful metaheuristic algorithm called Binary Enhanced Golden Jackal Optimization (BEGJO), which is an improved version of the recently published Golden Jackal Optimization (GJO) algorithm. The original GJO algorithm faces challenges when dealing with high-dimensional FS problems, as it tends to get trapped in local optima. To address this issue, various enhancement strategies are employed to improve the efficiency of GJO. The proposed BEGJO algorithm utilizes Copula Entropy (CE) to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional FS problems while maintaining high classification accuracy using the K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier. Additionally, four enhancement strategies are incorporated to enhance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the fundamental GJO algorithm. The BEGJO algorithm is transformed into its binary form using the sigmoid transfer function, aligning it with the nature of the FS problem. It is then tested on various high-dimensional benchmark datasets. The effectiveness of BEGJO is evaluated by comparing it with well-known algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, feature dimension, and processing time. BEGJO outperforms other algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and feature dimension and ranks up to fourth in terms of processing time. Furthermore, the advantageous use of CE is demonstrated by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with traditional FS algorithms. Statistical evaluations are conducted to further validate the effectiveness and supe-riority of the proposed algorithm. The results confirm that BEGJO is an effective solution for high-dimensional FS problems.

AB Many real-world applications require predicting data changes over a longer period, such as early warning for energy consumption and long-term planning for transportation. Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) demands models with high predictive capability. Recently, transformer-based models have achieved notable success in LTSF. However, the inherent nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism in Transformers can lead to the loss of certain temporal patterns. Therefore, we propose a dual-channel network with deep cross-decomposition for LTSF, called CrossWaveNet. In order to better capture long-term dependencies, unlike the complex network structure of Transformer, a simpler and more effective dual channel network model for season and trend-cyclical is constructed. The original time series is decomposed into seasonal and trend-cyclical components simultaneously, and the dual-channel network structure is used to extract their features, respectively. This structure can improve the model's generalization ability, which can have good results on various types of time series data. To effectively improve the accuracy of data decomposition, the moving average method is first used to obtain coarse-grained seasonal and trend-cyclical components, and then the extracted seasonal and trend-cyclical components are gradually merged into their respective channels through the dual-channel network with deep cross-decomposition, thereby obtaining finegrained components and effectively improving prediction performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods in long-term forecasting, CrossWaveNet has achieved the highest prediction accuracy and significant relative performance improvement in fields such as energy, transportation, weather, and disease transmission.

AB The histopathological analysis of a suspected region is critical for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and manage-ment. Histopathological diagnosis consists in analyzing the characteristics of the lesions using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Classification of digital tumor pathology images, called whole slide images (WSIs), is a great challenge since WSIs usually have huge resolutions while lacking localized annotations. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a commonly used method applied to pathological image analysis. However, most MIL methods often focus only on the global representation of WSIs, ignoring whether the category labels play other roles in the model training besides being a supervision signal. In addition, feature confusion is also a problem that should be avoided for the analysis of WSIs with weakly supervised methods. To address these problems, we propose a novel algorithm of classifying WSI for cancer diagnosis. The proposed model, ProMIL, uses only slide-level labels rather than localized annotations for analysis. There are three innovations in this work. Firstly, we present the concept of class proxy which is the representation of the intrinsic feature of each category, and plays a key role in guiding the training of the model. Secondly, we design a novel WSI representation learning module that utilizes a multi-scale feature extraction strategy to represent each patch in a WSI and then aggregates these representations using an attention mechanism to encode the WSI. Thirdly, we design a metric-learning-based weakly supervised multiclass-classifier by measuring the similarity between each WSI embedding and class proxies. The proposed ProMIL can effectively alleviate the side effect of feature confusion, and carry intuitive interpretability and scalability. To evaluate the performance of ProMIL, we conduct a series of experiments on several datasets of WSIs with different types of cancer from open data sources. It can be observed from the experimental results that ProMIL outperforms most of the compared methods and achieves better performance on a various type of cancer image data for classification, thus suggesting the proposed method is suitable for classifying different categories of cancer rather than a specific kind of cancer. Therefore, it is expected to act as a general framework to be extended to more cancer diagnoses.

AB Colorectal polyp segmentation can help physicians screen colonoscopy images, which is essential for prevent -ing colorectal cancer. The segmentation of polyps encounters multiple challenges, like small size, uneven brightness, blurred edges, and the potential confusion of folds with objects. Although existing methods have shown promising performance in addressing these challenges, there are three main shortcomings: (1) during the segmentation process, small polyp objects are lost, (2) the decoder stage faces challenges in restoring fine-grained details of the features, and (3) the limited capacity to aggregate multi-scale features. We propose a cross-attention and feature exploration network (CAFE-Net) for polyp segmentation to address these challenges. The work offers the following contributions: (1) a feature supplement and exploration module (FSEM) supplements in missing details and explores latent features, (2) a cross-attention decoder module (CADM) effectively preserves features from lower layers and restores fine-grained information, and (3) a multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) module maximizes the utilization of previously learned features. We conducted extensive experiments and compared CAFE-Net with nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The CAFE-Net demonstrates the best segmentation accuracy across multiple polyp datasets as well as has an obvious advantage in segmenting small polyp objects.

AB This paper addresses a novel scheduling problem, namely the cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem (CFJSP), which has critical applications in the modern electronic information equipment manufacturing industry. The CFJSP is composed of a distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem and hybrid flowshop scheduling problem. This paper considers how to arrange a variety of jobs for the two flowshops together to minimize total flowtime. We present a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model and an effective adaptive iterated greedy (AIG) algorithm with a decomposition and collaboration mechanism, which optimizes each production phase sequentially and ultimately optimizes the whole process. Combining the problem-specific characteristic, an adaptive inverse bounded heuristic, an adaptive bounded range local search, and an odd/even random insertion reconstruction mechanism are proposed to explore more valuable space. Comprehensive computational experiments and statistical analyses are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed AIG. The experimental results show that the proposed AIG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms from the literature in relative deviation index values at the same CPU running time.

AB There is a growing need of stochastic integral equations (SIEs) to investigate the behavior of complex dynamical systems. Since real-world phenomena frequently dependent on noise sources, modeling them naturally necessitates the use of SIEs. As most SIEs cannot be solved explicitly, thus the behaviors of the studied systems are investigated using approximate solutions of their SIEs. Despite the fact that this problem has been soundly investigated and numerous methods have been presented, the practice demonstrated that obtaining satisfied approximations is not always guaranteed, necessitating the development of new effective techniques. This paper gives a new technique for solving nonlinear Ito-Volterra SIEs by reducing them to linear or nonlinear algebraic systems via the power of a combination of generalized Lagrange functions and Jacobi-Gauss collocation points. The accuracy and reliability of the new technique are evaluated and compared with the existing techniques. Moreover, sufficient conditions to make the estimate error tends to zero are given. The new technique shows surprisingly high efficiency over the existing techniques in terms of computational efficiency and approximation capability. The accuracy of the solution based on the new technique is much higher than that via the existing techniques. The required time of the new technique is much less than that of the existing techniques, where, in some circumstances, the existing techniques take more than 20 times as long as the new technique.

AB This study introduces a novel model designed to classify macrocauses of violent crimes. The model's practical application is demonstrated through its integration into the framework of the Natal Smart City Initiative in Brazil. Utilizing the Design Science methodology, the study details the model's development, its subsequent implementation through a machine learning pipeline, and its assessment employing four prominent classification techniques: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. XGBoost performed exceptionally well, achieving an average accuracy of 0.961791, an F1-Score of 0.961410, and an AUC of ROC curve of 0.994732. Accurate classification of criminal macrocauses is crucial for developing effective public safety policies. The proposed model can provide public safety institutions and criminal analysts with a valuable tool for better understanding aspects related to violent crime analysis in their cities. This can streamline the analysis and management process and provide more accurate information for decision-making. This study also has important implications for the emerging field of smart cities. By providing a tool to assist in decision-making and planning public safety strategies, this work contributes to the development of innovative, data-based, and theory-based solutions to address urban challenges.

AB Distributed Job-shop Scheduling Problem (DJSP) is a hotspot in industrial and academic fields due to its valuable application in the real-life productions. For DJSP, the available methods aways complete the job selection first and then search for an appropriate factory to assign the selected job, which means job selection and job assignment are done independently. This paper proposes an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make the two decisions simultaneously. To capture the problem characteristics and realize the objective optimization, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of DJSP is formulated. Specialised action space made up of operation-factory pairs is designed to achieve the simultaneous decision-making. A stitched disjunctive graph representation of DJSP is specially designed, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based feature extraction architecture is proposed to dig the state embedding during problem solving. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method is applied to train an action-selection policy. To further lead the agent to assign jobs to the factory with smaller makespan, a probability enhancement mechanism is designed. The experimental results on 240 test instances have shown that the proposed method outperforms 8 classical Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs), 3 closely-related RL methods and 5 metaheuristics in terms of effectiveness, stability and generalization.

AB Necessity of predictive maintenance appears when production assets such as machines need either a repair or a regular check. When it comes to monitoring digital twins of objects, maintenance predictions in time play a significant role. This study targets an artificial intelligence-based prediction of time-series data integrated with fully consistent expert elicitation. It also allows the integration of expert knowledge into the construction and explanation of the predictor. Moreover, it is considered a hybrid approach using data and expert knowledge for time series prediction. Reliability of obtained prediction is examined through comparisons with basic dynamic and static forecasts. Decision-making analysis based on expert's opinions and optimization science coincides to prepare the data set for ANN prediction. Thus, the maintenance process will become predictable over time. Moreover, this prediction avoids sudden overhaul cost. Therefore, the entire production system is kept controlled. In this research, a FUll COnsistently Method (FUCOM) of optimization together with Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is used for obtaining optimal weights. Then, dynamic and static time-series forecasts are compared with ANN prediction. The obtained results prove ANN reliability according to expert's opinions and FUCOM optimization model. FUCOM-ANN prediction achieves nearly 10 times smaller RMSE (0.08) than the RMSE (0.83) of general ANN prediction on the test data set. Moreover, the 10-fold cross-validation strategy shows better RMSE (0.13) for FUCOM-ANN validation sets than the RMSE (0.78) of general ANN validation sets.

AB Motivated by the goals of overcoming inherent engineering difficulties on segmentation accuracy arising from low contrast and complex tissue relationships in medical images, this paper investigates how key information can be extracted and analyzed in a targeted manner to discover relationships between tissues and enhance feature differentiation. It proposes the Key Information-guided segmentation algorithm, which consists of two key components: the Key Region-guided Sparse Self-Attention (KRSSA) module and the Hard Pixels Multisubclass Contrast learning (HPMCL) module. The former is applied in the encoder by activating the importance of global features and adaptively selecting attentional regions. Experimental results show that propagating large amounts of complex and redundant information suppresses learning. The latter is applied in the final decision layer, where the feature space of each class is partitioned into several subclasses, and hard pixels are continuously pulled towards the closest subclass of their respective class, away from all subclasses of other classes by contrastive learning. Experimental results show that moving pixels towards subclasses rather than a single class center leads to more effective segmentation results. In summary, we propose a novel visual model and extensively validate it on the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2019 Challenge (BraTS2019) dataset, BraTS2020 dataset, and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset, namely in brain tumors and the hippocampus. The Dice similarity coefficients of 0.806, 0.904, and 0.853 for the enhanced tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively, in the Brats2020 validation set ranked fourth out of 345 participating methods. This method has significant implications for addressing challenges in medical image segmentation, including low attention to key regions, class imbalance, and background interference.

AB Accurate state-of-charge (SOC) detection was still a challenging task to complete due to complex battery dynamics and constantly changing external conditions. The formula for SOC was difficult to determine since external parameters including voltage, current, temperature, and battery arrangement were complex. Also the methods for estimating SOC that were already in use were not always appropriate for the same car operating in various road and climatic conditions. In all situations, the conventional methodologies did not deliver an accurate estimation performance. Here, a unique optimization-based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was created to accurately determine a battery's SOC and enhance the operation and safety of battery systems. A lithium ion battery was first created, and data on its current, voltage, SOC, capacity, duration, and discharge rate were gathered to produce a real-time dataset at several temperatures, including 0(degrees), 25(degrees) and 45(degrees). The dataset underwent additional pre-processing to standardize the values and enhance the accuracy of the data. To determine the precise state of the battery, these pre-data were loaded into the ELM model. However, the performance of ELM was significantly influenced by the length of training and the number of neurons in a hidden layer. An advanced Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm (HBA) was used to choose the appropriate hidden neurons and increase the estimation accuracy in order to overcome this problem. The proposed SOC estimation model provides 97% accuracy in the FUDS drive cycle and 99% accuracy in the US06 drive cycle. The proposed model provides a well performance for estimating SOC in lithium-ion battery at various temperature, also the proposed model was fit for real time implementation.

AB The shortage of labeled data is a major obstacle to the practical application of advanced fault diagnosis technologies, and the large amount of unlabeled data may be the key to solving this problem. This paper proposes a self-attention based contrastive leaning method for bearing fault diagnosis which utilizes the unlabeled data for self-supervised learning. Using the self-attention-based signal transformer as the backbone, the proposed method is able to learn feature extraction capability from a large number of unlabeled data by contrastive learning using only positive samples. Then using a small number of labeled data for fine-tuning, the proposed method can perform accurate fault diagnosis. Experiments using both run-to-failure and artificial fault vibration signal datasets show that the proposed method can not only outperform other semi-supervised or self-supervised learning methods but also exceed the accuracy of supervised learning methods in case of insufficient labels. The visualization shows the interpretability of the model and the feature extraction ability obtained from self-supervised pre-training.

ID RECOMMENDATION
AB E-tourism websites offer users a vast array of travel destinations and opportunities, necessitating tools that enable destination comparison and intelligent search capabilities. One key requirement for such tools is the ability to measure the similarity between destinations. Over the years, various similarity measurement techniques have been proposed, including user-based and content-based approaches. However, many of these techniques require data preparation or prior domain knowledge from experts. In contrast, this study proposes an innovative approach that requires no prior domain knowledge of flight destinations or their relationships, and utilizes only readily available data. Our approach draws upon concepts from image recognition and natural language pro-cessing (NLP) to extract hidden aspects of destinations. Using data from a flight-search website as a testbed, we analyze similarity metrics based on state-of-the-art methods for image recognition, NLP, and product-network analysis. We then compare these metrics to those obtained by human subjects. Our findings suggest that no single method dominates in all aspects, leading us to propose a hybrid method that leverages the strengths of each. The proposed method can be readily applied to measure product similarity in other domains.

AB Heterogeneous multi-attribute group decision making (HMAGDM) is a kind of complex decision making problem, which exists widely in reality. The purpose of this paper is to extend data envelopment analysis (DEA) for solving the HMAGDM problems whose attribute values include real numbers, intervals, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and linguistic variables. For this purpose, a method to HMAGDM based on a fuzzy DEA cross-efficiency model is proposed. In the proposed method, heterogeneous information is uniformly transformed into intervals, which are expressed as variables with unknown parameters. On this basis, a fuzzy DEA cross-efficiency model is established to calculate the individual cross-efficiency intervals of decision making units (DMUs). The model takes into consideration all possible attribute values of each DMU in the intervals, and obtains stable evaluation results through peer evaluation mode and iteration. Then, a maximizing group consensus model is established to calculate the weights of decision makers (DMs). Given the weights of DMs, the individual cross-efficiency intervals can be aggregated into the collective cross-efficiency interval, and DMU can be ranked based on this. An example of supplier selection is presented to illustrate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we present the 'pre-mortem Stackelberg game approach' as a non-cooperative game model that can serve as a viable alternative to the conventional decentralized network DEA model, which suffers from the infeasibility problem. We identified the circumstances that give rise to the issue and recommended the use of non-radial slacks as a remedy. The rationale behind this method is provided in relation to relevant game theories as a modeling justification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted an empirical study on the performance evaluation of local agents of a Korean life insurance company. Our findings show that the proposed model not only provides an alternative efficiency measure for the follower but also enables an optimal adjustment of intermediate products, for which feasible solutions do not exist under the conventional decentralized network DEA model. Moreover, the proposed model delivers efficiency measures that are equivalent to those of the conventional model when feasible solutions do exist. The proposed model is expected to facilitate the use of non-cooperative game in network DEA, particularly when the VRS assumption is appropriate for performance evaluation.

AB This paper is mainly concerned with the quasi-synchronization of stochastic heterogeneous networks (SHNs). Furthermore, the control strategy adopted here combines the advantages of aperiodically intermittent pinning control (AIPC) and sampled-data control, namely intermittent pinning sampled-data control. Different from intermittent control referred to in existing results, the restriction of the lower bound of control rate for AIPC, which is called the quasi-periodicity condition, is removed. As the main results, through an auxiliary timer, Lyapunov method, and inequality techniques, several sufficient conditions for quasi-synchronization of SHNs are derived. Especially, two different estimations of sampling error are given and the obtained results indicate that the maximum allowable bound of the sampling interval can be calculated easily. Then, some easily verified quasi-synchronization criteria are provided. Finally, to show the feasibility of our theoretical results, two numerical examples are provided.

AB This paper addresses the Family Traveling Salesman Problem (FTSP), a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem that group nodes into families. The goal is to select the best route by visiting only a subset of nodes from each family. We developed two methods to solve the FTSP: (i) a parallel branch-and-cut algorithm with an efficient local search procedure (P-B&C) to obtain an optimal solution, and (ii) an adaptive metaheuristic that combines the Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) with a reinforcement learning algorithm. In this case, the Q-Learning algorithm controls the parameters of the BRKGA during the evolutionary process. We perform computational experiments on a well-known benchmark dataset with 185 instances. Our P-B&C proves the optimal value for 179 instances, improving the best upper bounds in 19 open instances. The new local search component of the P-B&C finds the best upper bounds for 50% of instances. The BRKGA-QL finds the optimal solution in 131 instances, improving the best upper bounds in 21 open instances. Finally, we compare our results with the best results in the literature, and both methods show robustness and efficiency in solving the FTSP.

AB Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) contain the satisfaction of various constraints and optimization of multiple objectives simultaneously, thus they are extremely challenging. Although many constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) have been proposed, they ignore the information of each constraint, which might help utilize more various infeasible solutions to improve the search ability of the population. Therefore, this paper proposes a new dual-population CMOEA to solve CMOPs, in which a dynamic constraint processing mechanism and a dynamic resource allocating scheme are designed. To be specific, the proposed algorithm evolves two populations, which adopt different mechanisms to handle constraints respectively. The main population directly optimizes all constraints to find the feasible Pareto optimal solutions, which can improve the feasibility. The auxiliary population adopts a dynamic constraint processing mechanism, which gradually increases the number of constraints being processed, so as to fully utilize various infeasible solutions to help find feasible regions. Moreover, a new dynamic resource allocating scheme is proposed to reasonably allocate the limited computational resources to the two populations according to their performance feedback. Experimental results on three test suites and ten practical problems show that the proposed algorithm has a better or competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art CMOEAs.

AB This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, cultural-particle swarm optimization (C-PSO), which is inspired by the cultural algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. It is aimed to balance the performance of exploration and exploitation and avoid trapping in the local optima. It introduces a probabilistic approach to update the inertia weight based on the improved metropolis rule. Generating the optimal path without collisions is challenging to ensure vehicles operate safely in real-time implementation. The contributions of C-PSO are to solve the path planning problem of multiple vehicles in modern industrial warehouses, achieving task allocation, fault tolerance and collision avoidance by a dual-layer framework. It was compared with the other algorithms, including PSO, PSO-GA, CA, HS, ABC, HPSGWO, TS and MA, by CEC benchmark functions and statistical tests to demonstrate its great performance with fewer iterations and runtime and the best solutions. It is validated through computational experiments, which involve 15 AGVs and 20 tasks for demonstration.

AB Edge detection is of critical importance for middle-level and high-level tasks in computer vision. Existing edge detection methods usually use VGG16 as the encoding network and achieve exceptional performance through transfer learning, which has the characteristics of high parameters and high computational cost. Researchers have implemented edge detection by designing decoding networks. Unlike existing methods, this paper is inspired by the effective mechanisms of edge detection in the parallel pathway of biological vision and proposes a new lightweight encoding-decoding structure for edge detection networks, which we refer to as XYW-Net. In the encoding network, we drew inspiration from the receptive field properties of X-type cells, Y-type cells, and W-type cells involved in the parallel pathway, and developed more meticulous convolutional models. Based on the structure of the parallel pathway, the three cell modules are combined into a novel encoding network and excellent feature extraction performance is obtained. Within the decoding network, this paper draws inspiration from the feature integration ability of the inferotemporal cortex (IT) and introduces a novel feature integration module to constitute the decoding network. Experiments show that the proposed network in this paper obtains the Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) = 0.812 on the BSDS500 dataset with only 0.79 M parameters. Additionally, the model has exhibited outstanding ODS performance on various publicly available edge detection datasets, including NYUD, BIPEDv1, and Multicue. Moreover, future research could concentrate on implementing more efficient antagonistic mechanisms and devising networks grounded in higher-level visual cortical mechanisms. This could further augment the performance and efficiency of edge detection networks. We encourage researchers to delve into these directions within the field.

ID HARDWARE TROJAN DETECTION; LEVEL
AB Hardware Trojans (HT) are the most malicious components attacking modern integrated circuits (ICs). Information leakage, incorrect functionality, and overheating are the major effects of HT insertion. Due to the outsourcing of multi-stage digital circuit design and fabrication, HTs can be inserted by rogues at every stage. The types of HTs and insertion methods evolve continuously and their detection becomes more complex. Consequently, designing integrated circuits robust to HT insertion seems efficient. A prerequisite for such a strategy is the evaluation of integrated circuit vulnerability to HT insertion. There are several factors involved in the vulnerability of fabricated integrated circuits such as the distribution of white spaces in the IC layout, the ratio of unutilized routing resources, the amount of activity of the circuit's nodes, the geometrical properties of the circuit's gates, the delay of various paths, and etc. The interrelation of these diverse factors makes IC vulnerability modeling a challenging problem. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) based approach is developed to combine all the effective factors in IC vulnerability analysis. Firstly, we generate a comprehensive dataset containing various types and sizes of hardware Trojans inserted into benchmark circuits. The benchmark circuits used in this study are ISCAS 85, ISCAS 89, and ITC 99. Then using the transfer learning concept seven state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks are trained and verified using the constructed dataset to classify every integrated circuit into three vulnerability levels (low, moderate, and highly vulnerable classes). Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves almost 95 % accuracy in the most successful case (VGG16). The lowest accuracy belongs to Inception V3 (similar to 87.65 %) which is much better than the most successful previous studies (72 %). This is mainly because the DNN-based method handles shortcomings (such as incomplete modeling of vulnerability-related factors) in the previous state-of-the-art methods efficiently.

TI Cryptanalysis of an image encryption algorithm using quantum chaotic map

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Image encryption; Quantum chaotic map; Chaotic encryption;
   Cryptanalysis; DNA coding
AB Recently, an image encryption algorithm using Quantum Chaotic Map and DNA Coding (QCMDC-IEA) has been reported. It consists of two main components: pixel-level permutation and DNA domain substitution. To support its ability to withstand various attacks, several security analyses and experimental simulations were presented. However, after careful cryptanalysis, we found that QCMDC-IEA has inherent fatal security problems. Although formally using complex chaos and DNA encoding, the chaos-based sequences used for encryption in QCMDCIEA are independent of a plain image such that it suffers from the defect of the existence of an equivalent key. Moreover, the lack of confusion and diffusion in DNA domain encryption makes it vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. DNA domain encryption is then essentially a 2-bit data substitution process, so it can be equivalently simplified. On this basis, we propose an attack method to crack QCMDC-IEA, which first obtains an equivalent permutation key by differential cryptanalysis, and then eliminates the DNA domain substitution based on a chosen-plaintext attack using only four special plain images and their corresponding cipher images, and finally recovers the original plain images. Our attack method takes full advantage of the security defects in QCMDCIEA and achieves complete decipherment with low complexity, thus better revealing its intrinsic security mechanism. To improve the security performance, some security enhancement suggestions are recommended for similar cryptosystems. Both theoretical analysis and experimental simulation results show that the proposed cryptographic attack method is effective and feasible for QCMDC-IEA with low attack complexity. Therefore, the cryptanalysis work in this paper can provide some theoretical hints for improving the security of a class of image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding and chaos.

ID GROUND SEGMENTATION
AB The utilization of 3D point clouds acquired via Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widespread in the fields of autonomous driving, satellite remote sensing, and spatial mapping. However, due to hardware limitations of the laser launch system and environmental interferences, the quality of point cloud data obtained through various types of LiDAR is often poor in real-world scenarios, containing extraneous noise and irrelevant data points. This poses a challenge for subsequent point cloud downstream tasks that (e.g., point cloud detection, recognition and tracking) require high-quality data. We propose a robust multi-task learning network for pre-processing LiDAR data. Our approach utilizes a shared PointNet encoder and three branching networks that perform denoising, single-object segmentation, and completion. The denoising branch network incorporates the traditional model based on geometric projection, leveraging the dual-driven approach of data and model for better capturing the characteristics of the point cloud. Regarding the segmentation branch network, we integrate an attention mechanism module suitable for single-object segmentation, enabling the network to better extract the point cloud features of complex objects. For the completion branch network, we employ a folded network structure to achieve a coarse-to-fine completion effect of the point cloud. We discuss the training methods, that is, end-to-end and step-by-step methods, which can enhance flexibility during the training and usage phase. Our proposed network outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in all three tasks on both ShapeNet and simulated point cloud data of the sea face scene while demonstrating superior robustness.

AB This research aimed to predict de novo malignancy in patients who underwent pancreas transplants using a machine learning approach. We constructed various predictive models based on data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) to classify malignant patterns in transplant patients. The models were trained using medical records spanning from 1987 to 2020 to identify essential prognostic components associated with malignancy development. Various datasets from the United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (UNOS-STAR) database were used to evaluate each model's performance using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting de novo malignancy in pancreas transplant patients. Specifically, we identified the recipient's B2 and DR1 antigens and the donor's DDAVP hormone as significant factors associated with malignancy. Our study highlights the importance of integrating medical re-cords from various sources to enhance the accuracy of predictive models for organ transplantation.

ID CONTINUOUS AUTHENTICATION
AB The growing number of mobile devices over the past few years brings a large amount of personal information, which needs to be properly protected. As a result, several mobile authentication methods have been developed. In particular, behavioural biometrics has become one of the most relevant methods due to its ability to extract the uniqueness of each subject in a secure, non-intrusive, and continuous way. This article presents SwipeFormer, a novel Transformer-based system for mobile subject authentication by means of swipe gestures in an unconstrained scenario (i.e., subjects could use their personal devices freely, without restrictions on the direction of swipe gestures or the position of the device). Our proposed system contains two modules: (i) a Transformer-based feature extractor, and (ii) a similarity computation module. Mobile data from the touchscreen and different background sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) have been studied, including in the analysis both Android and iOS operating systems. A complete analysis of SwipeFormer is carried out using an in-house large-scale database acquired in unconstrained scenarios. In these operational conditions, SwipeFormer achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) values of 6.6% and 3.6% on Android and iOS respectively, outperforming the state of the art. In addition, we evaluate SwipeFormer on the popular publicly available databases Frank DB and HuMIdb, achieving EER values of 11.0% and 5.0% respectively, outperforming previous approaches under the same experimental setup.

AB In robotic control systems, autonomous car driving is considered a complicated task. The conventional modular techniques necessitate precise localization, planning, and mapping procedures to provide safe driving. These requirements make autonomous car driving tasks computationally ineffective and sensitive to ecological changes. In recent times, the emergence of deep learning-based approaches in autonomous car driving systems provided promising solutions for complex vision task interpretation, localization, and environmental perception. But, they create distribution mismatch issues and require huge perilous interaction information to offer safe driving with the prediction of future collisions. Therefore, to overcome this issue, a novel Modified Kernel Support vector Convolutional based Hybrid Grasshopper Harris hawk (MKSC-HGH) approach is proposed. The proposed MKSC-HGH approach efficiently forecasts the uncertainties of agile autonomous car driving and guides proper navigation details of the track to avoid the possibility of collision with on-road obstacles and fences. This system inputs camera images captured through sensors, car speed, and manual driving data to analyze and predict safety control and probable collision. The prominent feature representing the ability of Modified Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) and complex boundary encoding process of Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM) with hyperparameter tuning operation of Modified Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm based Improved Harris Hawk Optimization (MGOA-IHHO) algorithm made proposed system applicable to predict future states (ie. visual prediction, speed prediction, and collision prediction) more accurately. The efficiency of the proposed MKSC-HGH approach is investigated using evaluation measures namely completion time, average speed, top speed, and laps time. The simulation outcome shows the superiority of the proposed MKSC-HGH approach in predicting agile autonomous car driving over state of art techniques about task performance and sample efficiency.

AB In this study, we proposed a cricket talent identification model based on fuzzy optimization that employs the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). To evaluate the performance of the model, we used a primary dataset (n = 56) collected from four different schools in J&K UT, India. Our model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall with an accuracy of 92.8%, precision of 96%, and recall of 88%. The model also achieved a low miss rate of 11% and an F1-score of 92.3%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to identify cricket talent using this methodology, which overcomes many limitations of conventional AHP-based models. By deriving an exact priority vector from the fuzzy comparison matrix for the criteria, our model eliminates the need for further procedures of defuzzification, making it more efficient and accurate. A comparative analysis of results gained from using Gaussian fuzzy numbers is also provided. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of using fuzzy optimization techniques for cricket talent identification.

AB The purpose of our study is to discuss the impact of consumers' market distribution and consumers' fairness concerns on the decisions of supply chain participants. Based on utility theory, we innovatively incorporate consumers' fairness concerns as a significant factor into the game model and focus on the impact of the utility gap between products on consumers' purchasing willingness. In this paper, we establish a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one traditional manufacturer, one low-carbon manufacturer, and one retailer, and comparatively analyze the equilibrium results under the initial state and consumers' fairness concerns. The results show that the presence of consumers' fairness concerns results in the higher wholesale price, higher retail price, and larger profit of low-carbon products yet leads to a decline in traditional products' pricing and profit, and the impacts on the low-carbon manufacturer are more significant than on the traditional manufacturer. A reduction appears in the retailer's profit since consumers' fairness concerns decrease the retailer's ability to differential pricing. Additionally, the impacts of consumers' fairness concerns on the game equilibrium are also affected by consumers' market distribution and low-carbon manufacturers' technical efficiency, and the impacts are more pronounced in an environment where low-carbon manufacturers' R&D investments are more efficient. Furthermore, in a market dominated by low-carbon preferred consumers, low carbon manufacturers are always more profitable than traditional manufacturers, while in a market dominated by traditionally preferred consumers, low-carbon manufacturers are only able to achieve higher profits than traditional manufacturers when R&D is quite efficient and consumers' fairness concerns are relatively strong.

AB Li-ion batteries have become the standard power source for electric vehicles (EVs) as the alternative of choice to reduce CO2 emissions. But before becoming a reliable technology, Li-ion batteries must deal with two significant challenges: undesirable electrochemical reactions caused by excessive charging rates and considerable time for an EV to get charged. It is necessary to employ balanced current profiles that prevent both serious battery degradation effects and the inconvenience to end users. In this work, the authors propose a safe exploration deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) approach in order to determine optimal charging profiles under variable operating conditions. One of the main advantages of RL techniques is that they can learn from interaction with the real or simulated system while incorporating the nonlinearity and uncertainty derived from fluctuating environmental conditions. However, since RL techniques must explore undesirable states before obtaining an optimal policy, no safety guarantees are provided. The proposed approach aims at maintaining zero-constraint violations throughout the learning process through the integration of a safety layer that corrects the action if a constraint is likely to be violated. The proposed method is tested in the equivalent circuit of a Li-ion battery under varying conditions. Results reveal that with the integration of this safety layer, SDRL is able to find safe optimized charging policies while considering a trade-off between the charging speed and the battery lifespan, including a 30% reduction in charging time while still maintaining temperatures within permissible limits and up to 38% of battery life conservation, compared with benchmark methods. Moreover, our approach does not experience episodes demonstrating restriction violations throughout the pre-training, training, and evaluation phases.

AB Image segmentation is an important step in obtaining image information, and it has always been an extremely critical link in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, threshold-based image segmentation technology has received significant attention and research by researchers. Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy are two important global threshold selection methods in image thresholding. They not only have a special correspondence in mathematical expression, but also have a certain relationship in the field of image segmentation. Considering the number of thresholds increases, the complexity of the expression of Tsallis entropy criterion function also increases sharply, which is difficult to apply in multiple thresholds. Given this, this paper proposes a simplified expression of Tsallis entropy with multiple thresholds, which is proved by mathematical induction. Simultaneously, it is concluded that the multiple-threshold seg-mentation of Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy with the same parameters is equivalent. To overcome the inconvenience of high calculation cost under multi-threshold and to improve calculation efficiency, recursive algorithms based on simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy under multi-threshold are given. The calcu-lation costs of the traditional Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy threshold, simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy threshold, and the recursive simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy are compared through ex-periments. The results have revealed that the calculation time of simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy is shorter than the traditional methods, and the calculation time of the recursive simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy is much lower than that of the simplified expression. Finally, we use the three optimization al-gorithms including particle swarm, differential evolution and Harris hawks algorithm to solve the optimal so-lutions of the six expressions in the case of multilevel thresholds. Experiments also show that recursive simplified Tsallis entropy and Renyi entropy have the lowest calculation time cost under the same parameters.

AB Today, mobile devices provide their users with a range of multiple services and powerful applications. Despite being beneficial, these applications are massively relying on gathering sensitive information from the mobile devices, which creates numerous challenges regarding security and latency problems. For instance, these applications' stakeholders take their time to select mobile device for gathering necessary resources. Therefore, this process of recruiting mobile devices will not be practical with sensing information which has an expiration date, which the time of collecting and recruiting these types of sensing information are surpassing its expiration date. As device-to-device (D2D) paradigms have been established as relevant communication for sharing sensing information in a low latency and minimum cost, it still suffers from mobility problems. Hence, mobile edge caching (MEC) system has been developed to increase efficiency of information sharing with mobility of high-flexibility. Nonetheless this paradigm has some challenges with regards to constructing a satisfactory resource sharing system concerning security and trust ability. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel security and privacy blockchain sharing (SPB-DS) system based on MEC system. A searchable keyword will be recorded on the system's blockchain for every sensing information and all requester devices that require to download specific sensing information, it will generate a trapdoor first for looking for the matching keyword in the blockchain system. To incentive provider devices an optimal payment mechanism has been developed for those who wish to partake in the system. An analysis of security demonstrates that the suggested protocol can satisfy many security goals, while an evaluation on performance illustrates high feasibility and scalability of the MEC system's proposed scheme.

AB The fuzzy set theory has been evolving to represent the uncertainty in the real-world decision-making environment. Literature has been steadily expanding to incorporate subjective judgments and ambiguous information in the decision-making process, aiming to enhance the reliability and flexibility of data representation. Fermatean Fuzzy Sets (FFSs), a recent extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, address the limitations associated with membership functions and the representation of hesitation in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of FFSs in exploiting uncertainty in selection and ranking decisions in MCDM problems. The performance of FFSs is investigated for Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) which is extended with Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for criteria evaluations. This study is designed to present a comparative analysis for three different types of fuzzy set definitions: classical fuzzy sets with fuzzy triangular numbers, Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs), and FFSs, for MCDM problems under uncertainty. The proposed methodology is applied to two real case studies: (i) to rank Turkish research universities for performance assessment and (ii) to select the optimal facility location for a company in the beverage industry. To assess the effectiveness of the FFSs in multiple criteria selection and ranking decisions, a comparative analysis is conducted on two real-world problems. The results show that FFSs provide valuable insight especially for multiple criteria ranking problems. The comparative analysis highlights the effectiveness of Fermatean Fuzzy SWARA-TOPSIS method and its potential for practical ranking applications.

ID GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK; IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION; ALGORITHM
AB To make the face hallucination process robust to impulse noise, a new outlier elimination based iterative neighbor representation (OEINR) algorithm is proposed in this work. The proposed algorithm computes the fidelity in the low-resolution (LR) space and the locality adaptor in the high-resolution (HR) space. It helps the proposed algorithm in obtaining better reconstruction weights and preserving individual characteristics of an input in the output faces. To compute the HR space-based locality adaptor, an HR face (named the assisting face) is generated by proposing a new objective function utilizing the merits of sparsity. Further, the iterative approach is applied to continuously improve the quality of the assisting face which succors in achieving better locality constraint, and hence better reconstruction weights. Moreover, outliers (impulse noise-contaminated pixels) are eliminated from weights calculation as well as the assisting face generation process which helps the proposed algorithm in minimizing the effect of impulse noise. The results obtained from the experiments conducted on public FEI, CAS+PEAL, CMU+MIT face databases, and surveillance videos and images exhibit the superiority of the proposed OEINR algorithm over existing comparative face hallucination methods.

ID DAMAGE DETECTION
AB The dataset is crucial for the results of crack segmentation in deep learning. However, the quantity and quality of annotations in datasets used for crack segmentation are uneven, and there is a lack of dataset benchmarks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dataset benchmark for pixel-level segmentation of concrete cracks based on a deep learning model. Firstly, the ability of Resnet-101, DRN, Xception, and Mobilenetv2 to extract crack features is evaluated to preferably select an appropriate backbone network for the DeepLabv3 + model. Secondly, based on the deep learning model and crack dataset, a universal calculation model is proposed to estimate the quantity benchmark of high-quality crack annotated samples, as well as the mixture ratio of high-quality and low-quality annotated samples. Additionally, a pixel-level visualization characterization method is constructed for inference results of crack edge details. The results show that the model with Resnet-101 as the backbone network exhibits significant performance, with pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), and frequency-weighted intersection-over-union (FWIoU) reaching 99.76%, 95.05%, and 99.52%, respectively. The combination ratio of low-quality and high-quality annotated crack images has different effects on the model performance for datasets with different number of samples. The proposed benchmark for the concrete crack dataset holds engineering value and significance, and can be applied to improve model performance by accurately selecting appropriate methods, such as increasing the number of samples in the dataset or optimizing the model architecture, while minimizing the annotation time of the dataset.

AB With a greater awareness of the challenges regarding environmental, societal, political, and economic factors, where reverse logistics has become a significant part of supply chain networks, this paper presents an integrated forward and reverse logistics network, named the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Forward/Reverse Cross-Docks (HF-VRPMFRCD). We consider a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles with different loading capacities and transportation costs. We also consider multiple cross-docks with two different operations: forward and reverse processes. The former focuses on delivering the demand from suppliers to customers, while the latter aims at returning unsold products from customers to suppliers. We propose a Simulated Annealing with Variable Neighborhood Descent (SAVND) algorithm for solving HF-VRPMFRCD, where Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) is a local search heuristic embedded in the framework of Simulated Annealing (SA). SAVND outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in solving the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Cross-Docks (HF-VRPMCD), where the VND heuristic significantly improves the quality of solutions. For HF-VRPMFRCD benchmark instances, SAVND provides optimal solutions for small-scale instances and better solutions than those of the GUROBI solver for remaining larger instances. Lastly, we present and discuss the benefits of integrating the forward and reverse processes.

AB In the present era, the implementation of scientifically grounded Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) has emerged as a pivotal solution to diverse decision-making challenges across various domains. Although a sub-stantial body of exploratory, conceptual, and experimental studies exists, only 9.457% studies have incorporated sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of MCDM methods. An exhaustive scientific exploration of sensitivity analysis within the scope of MCDM is thus lacking. This research aims to address this gap through Bibliometric Analysis while examining 1374 articles published between January 2000 and March 2023 from the Scopus database. Using RStudio (Biblioshiny), CiteSpace, and VOSviewer software, the study constructs a visual rep-resentation of the most prolific countries, institutions, and authors. Impressively, China takes the lead in article publications, while India excels in international collaboration. "An extended TODIM multi-criteria group decision-making method for green supplier selection in an interval type-2 fuzzy environment," featured in the Journal of Environmental Management, emerges as the most cited paper with a total citation of 455. The study also identifies the top three most cited journals, namely "Journal of Cleaner Production," "Expert Systems With Applications," and "Computers and Industrial Engineering." "North China Electric Power University" is the leading institute with the highest research outputs. "Pamuc ˇar D" is the most cited author, with 2594 citations and 39 articles, followed by "Kahraman C" and "Zavadskas EK. This study sheds light on trends in scientific de-velopments and collaborations, providing a model for the application of sensitivity analysis in MCDM research and highlighting global trends. An understanding of the current state of sensitivity analysis research can assist researchers working in the entire domain of MCDM. Additionally, the visualization provides prescriptive data for future work and applications related to sensitivity analysis.

TI Augmented weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network for marine

DT Article
DE Marine object detection; Small-scale target; Multi-scale feature;
   Augmented weighted bidirectional fusion path
AB Detecting marine object is an attractive but challenging task in ocean exploration and conservation. Although the current popular object detection algorithms perform well in general. Because underwater images are affected by color projections and the scale of the object is usually smaller, the detection performance for marine object is not ideal. Therefore, this paper proposes an augmented weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network (AWBiFPN) that reduces the weakening of underwater image features and improves the integration efficiency of multi-scale feature, improving marine object detection performance. Specifically, this paper designs a multi-scale feature pyramid for efficient integration of feature information at all levels by combining weighted bidirectional integration pathway with designed Consistent Supervision module. Using Residual Feature Augmentation module to enhance the extraction of unchanging proportional contextual information, reduce the loss of information at the highest level of the feature map in the pyramid network and provide richer particulate characteristics for small-target detection. To scale the feature map and effectively utilize the feature information of different channels in the same spatial location, this article proposes the AWBiFPN layer, which replaces the depthwise separable convolution in the original BiFPN layer with conventional convolution. Evaluated on underwater image dataset (UTDAC), only 12 epochs are trained to 81.63% of mAP; experimented on MS COCO benchmark, achieving 37.9 AP. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the Aquarium Life dataset (AMLD) and underwater detection dataset under natural light (RUOD) are 81.41% mAP and 83.62% mAP, respectively. The results show that the method performed better not only in marine object detection but also in general class detection.

AB Traditional SVM algorithms for multi-class (k > 2 classes) classification tasks include "one-against-one", "one -against-rest", and "one-against-one-against-rest", which build k(k-1)/2 or k classifiers for space partitioning and classification decision. However, they may cause a variety of problems, such as an imbalanced problem, a high temporal complexity, and trouble establishing the decision boundary. In this study, we use the notion of minimizing structural risks (SRM) to recognize k classes by designing only one optimization problem, which we call (MHS)-H-3-SVM. The (MHS)-H-3-SVM offers numerous benefits. In summary, the following points should be emphasized: (1) Rather than dividing the space with hyper-planes, (MHS)-H-3-SVM describes the structural characteristics of various classes of data and trains the hyper-sphere classifier of each class based on the data distribution. (2) (MHS)-H-3-SVM inherits all of the advantages of classical binary SVM, such as the maximization spirit, the use of kernel techniques to solve nonlinear separable problems, and excellent generalization ability. (3) In the dual problem, we develop an SMO algorithm to effectively reduce the complexity of time and space. We eventually validate the preceding statement with comprehensive experiments. The experiment findings show that our method outperforms other mainstream methods in terms of computing time and classification performance on synthetic datasets, UCI datasets, and NDC datasets.

AB Existing cross-modal hash retrieval methods can simultaneously enhance retrieval speed and reduce storage space. However, these methods face a major challenge in determining the similarity metric between two modalities. Specifically, the accuracy of intra-modal and inter-modal similarity measurements is inadequate, and the large gap between modalities leads to semantic bias. In this paper, we propose a Similarity Graph-correlation Reconstruction Network (SGRN) for unsupervised cross-modal hashing. Particularly, the local relation graph rebasing module is used to filter out graph nodes with weak similarity and associate graph nodes with strong similarity, resulting in fine-grained intra-modal similarity relation graphs. The global relation graph reconstruction module is further strengthens cross-modal correlation and implements fine-grained similarity alignment between modalities. In addition, in order to bridge the modal gap, we combine the similarity representation of real-valued and hash features to design the intra-modal and inter-modal training strategies. SGRN conducted extensive experiments on two cross-modal retrieval datasets, and the experimental results effectively validated the superiority of the proposed method and significantly improved the retrieval performance.

AB Most existing distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling problems (DHFSPs) assume identical shops and lack consideration of heterogeneous shops. This study focuses on energy-efficient heterogeneous DHFSP. A multi -objective memetic algorithm with particle swarm optimization and Q-learning-based local search is proposed in order to optimize both makespan and total energy consumption. Particle swarm optimization with multi-group is specifically designed as a global search strategy to improve the fast convergence performance of solutions in multi-direction of Pareto front. To improve the problem-specific knowledge search, two local search strategies are designed to further improve the quality and diversity of solutions. In addition, Q-learning is utilized to guide variable neighborhood search to better balance the exploration and exploitation of algorithms. This study investigates the effect of parameter setting and conducts extensive numerical tests. The comparative results and statistical analysis demonstrate the superior convergence and distribution performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB As agricultural applications are specialized, plant diseases are diverse, and there is a lack of agricultural datasets, current plant disease identification performance is inadequate. In this study, vision transformer (ViT)-like methods are applied to plant disease identification, and an edge-feature guidance module (EFG) to enhance insufficient local information, such as edge features, is proposed for the first time. The consistency and performance of the ViT-based EFG module is verified on four datasets. In particular, the EFG module is relatively independent and can improve the feature extraction capabilities of any ViT-like method. We design efficient ViT backbones and combine them with state-of-the-art methods, namely, ViT, PVT, and Swin, to enhance the fusion of multiscale features and edge information. Our proposed approach is particularly effective for improving plant disease identification. The results of comparative experiments on Paddy, Wheat, Cabbage, and Coffee datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improved feature-fitting performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art models.

AB For large-scale multi-objective optimization problems, it is not easy for existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to search the entire decision variable space with limited computation resources. To alleviate this problem, we propose a learning and potential area-mining evolutionary algorithm to explore and exploit key regions for accelerating optimization. First, we mine promising areas by clustering the population-gathered regions. Then, potential directions are determined by a multi-guiding point scheme in these promising areas. Subsequently, we design a local search and global search scheme to enhance population convergence while ensuring diversity. Finally, a mutation strategy is used to improve diversity. We execute numerical experiments on two widely-used LSMOP benchmarks and compare the proposed algorithm with three state-of-the-art algorithms. The statistical results indicate that the proposed algorithm has significant performance.

AB Existing intelligent classification methods could be inefficient to deal with the hybrid environments including hesitant fuzzy information and real numbers. With respect to this real issue, in this study, we propose some new intelligent methods to achieve deep learning and intelligent classification under this hybrid environment. To do this, we construct the hesitant fusion bidirectional recurrent neural network (HF-BiRNN) based on the hesitant fusion mechanism. Then, the twice-cycle mechanism is designed, which includes the extension mechanism and the decomposition-reorganization mechanism, to fully utilize the original data and optimize the classification results. Meanwhile, the overlap degree algorithm is constructed to filter the optimal outputs. After that, we further propose the hesitant expansion BiRNN (HE-BiRNN) by combining with the twice-cycle mechanism, overlap degree algorithm, and BiRNN. Lastly, these new methods are used to the problems of driving route classification and red wine quality assessment. The derived optimal results and comparison analysis fully show the effectiveness and feasibility of the new proposed mechanisms and developed models.

AB Natural resources, such as light and CO2, are required to increase crop yields in protected agriculture. Developing efficient regulation methods to reduce costs and increase yields has become a major challenge for actual production. This work proposed a framework for meeting this challenge and supporting the management of environmental regulation. Photosynthesis rate was used as the yield index, and a photosynthesis rate model was constructed using support vector regression. Moreover, a regulation cost function for light and CO2 was constructed. Then, the non-inferior solutions (NIS) for environmental regulation were determined by an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (i-nsGA II). The curvature theory was applied to calculate the optimal solution in the NIS set. A set of seedling tomato data was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. Compared with the other two regulation methods (saturation regulation method and U-chord method), the results indicated that the proposed method had the best performance. About 80% of the maximum photosynthesis rate could be obtained at a regulation cost of about 51%. This research presents a new strategy for optimizing the greenhouse environment, which can be applied as a knowledge-informed expert system to manage environmental regulation.

AB Despite the good clustering performance, most of existing multi-view subspace clustering methods fail to consider the non-linear relationships of high-dimensional data, higher-order correlations of different views, and optimal local geometric structure of the latent embedding space simultaneously. To this end, we put forward a novel multi-view subspace clustering model, named deep low-rank tensor embedding (DLTE). In DLTE, we project the high-dimensional data into the low-dimensional embedding space by utilizing deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which can efficiently capture the complex non-linear relationship of data. Moreover, in the deep embedding space, we utilize the weighted low-rank tensor constraint to capture the global structure and higher-order correlations of different views while considering the contributions of different views. Additionally, we introduce an optimal graph Laplacian to learn a more reasonable local geometric structure of data in the deep embedding space. At last, comprehensive experimental results on eleven datasets indicate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed DLTE method.

AB In recent years, the flexible job shop dynamic scheduling problem (FJDSP) has received considerable attention; however, FJDSP with transportation resource constraint is seldom investigated. In this study, FJDSP with transportation resource constraint is considered and an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) algorithm (DQNSGA) integrated with reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. In DQNSGA, an initialization method based on heuristic rules and an insertional greedy decoding approach are designed, and a double-Q Learning with an improved epsilon-greedy strategy is used to adaptively adjust the key parameters of NSGAIII. An improved elite selection strategy is also applied. Through extensive experiments and practical case studies, this algorithm has been compared with three other well-known algorithms. The results demonstrate that DQNSGA exhibits significant effectiveness and superiority in all tests. The research presented in this paper enables effective adjustments of production plans in response to dynamic events, which is of critical importance for production management in the manufacturing industry.

AB With the progress of science and technology, optimization problems have become complex. Meta-heuristic algorithms have the advantages of high efficiency and strong global search ability in solving optimization problems, so more and more meta-heuristic algorithms are proposed and investigated deeply, and how to improve the universality of an algorithm is an important issue. In this paper, propose an optimization algorithm that simulates human memory behaviour, fully known as human memory optimization Algorithm, abbreviated as HMO, which simulates the way humans behave in production, stores human preferences for success and failure, simulates the way humans behave in their memory, gradually moving towards better directions and outcomes to find a reasonable optimal solution. The results were compared with other meta-heuristic algorithms in the CEC 2013 test set and showed that HMO has better optimization capabilities, and the feasibility of the algorithm was verified from convergence analysis and parametric analysis experiments. In three engineering optimization problems, HMO was able to find optimal solutions within a reasonable range of parameters, verifying the practicality of HMO.

AB This paper studies the bundled task assignment problem within the context of mobile crowdsensing. It builds upon the traditional task assignment problem by introducing the concept of task bundles. In this scenario, each requester submits a bundle of two tasks to the platform, which can choose to accept both, accept one, or reject both. The study adopts a disaggregate approach to ensure that the overall quality of workers assigned to each selected task meets a predefined quality threshold. T Additionally, the problem considers both premium and discount pricing strategies for task bundles. The study develops two integer programming formulations for the new version of the problem. The second formulation, in particular, is found to be amenable to solution via column generation, providing near-optimal solutions for problem instances that are larger than those used in the literature. The research contributes to the field of mobile crowdsensing by providing a more realistic variation of the traditional task problem and developing an effective solution method.

AB In an increasingly competitive market, most online tour operators have launched personalized travel itinerary recommendation services. Different from previous studies, this research considers the travel itinerary planning problem under total time limit and uncertain traffic time. This problem requires two stages of decision -making: firstly, selecting the tourist attractions to visit from the candidate attractions based on maximizing the popularity utility of tourists; secondly, planning the tourist attraction visit sequence under stochastic traffic time to maximize the tourist activity utility. Therefore, a two-stage stochastic optimization model with chance constraint is constructed and then solved by the sample average approximation (SAA) method. In order to verify the effectiveness of our model, we introduced two benchmark models for comparative analysis. The results show that in the worst case, our model increases the reliability level of travel itineraries by almost 40% compared with the two benchmark models. In addition, case studies of two large cities, i.e., Nanjing and Beijing, indicate that a tour operator can optimize travel itinerary recommendations by improving tourists utility as well as their own profitability without much loss of reliability.

AB This study explores the recent use of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) in the decision process in the areas of economics, finance and management to identify common contingency factors, current trends, representative studies and directions for further research applications in the target areas. A systematic literature review of 434 ANP studies for a 10-year period (2012-2021) within the Scopus database was conducted using the keyword "Analytic Network Process" in articles indexed in the following two categories: (1) Business, Management and Accounting, and (2) Economics, Econometrics and Finance. Further analysis using a citation-based graph and contingency analysis approaches was performed to identify usage trends. Our findings indicate that the most common ANP applications are with sustainable supply chain management and business evaluation frameworks. There is also a trend of applications engaging stakeholders in the decision-making process. Finally, it was found that the ANP is most commonly used as part of a multicriteria multi-method (a method followed by others) or integrated decision-making (hybridization of methods) approach rather than alone. The most common use (>80%) of the ANP is as part of a multi-method or integrated method with other tools such as DEMATEL, which suggests these approaches, in particular integrated ones (>50%), are becoming the preferred method of analysis to simplify the ANP process. From a practical point of view, it was found that the ANP is particularly utilized in sustainable projects to facilitate the participation of various stakeholders. This is the first focused review of the use of the ANP in the areas of economics, finance and management with an emphasis on its application as well as its contingent factors. Also, representative studies have been highlighted in each area. Traditional reviews have not delved deeply into the areas and contingent factors that this study explores.

AB Assessing landslide susceptibility and predicting the possibility of landslide event is the foundation and prerequisite for emergency response and management of landslide disaster. The target of current paper is to propose five integration models based on integrating locally weighted learning (LWL) with a radial basis function classifier (RBF), Fisher's linear discriminant (FLDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), a Credal decision tree (CDT), an alternating decision tree (ADT) and random subspace (RS) and the performance of five integration models were compared for modeling landslide susceptibility. Yongxin County from China was employed as a study area, 364 landslide locations and fifteen environmental factors were applied. The results demonstrate that the proposed LWL-RS-ADT model is more reliable and stable than the other models. Among the fifteen environmental factors, NDVI, lithology, and altitude are the very significant factors in the six models. It is concluded that the proposed integration models provide an effective way to predict the susceptibility of landslides.

AB An increasing number of studies have shown the effectiveness of using deep reinforcement learning to learn profitable trading strategies from financial market data. However, a single-agent model is not sufficient to handle complex financial scenarios. To address this problem, a novel approach called Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (Later called MADDQN) is proposed in this study, which reasonably balances the pursuit of maximum revenue and the avoidance of risk under the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework by innovatively employing two different agents represented respectively by two time-series feature extraction networks, TimesNet, and the Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network. Furthermore, to achieve a more generalized model suitable for different underlying assets, a mixed dataset containing three major U.S. stock indexes is collected. And the proposed model has been pre-trained in this dataset and subsequently refined for the specified asset. The results from experiments on five different stock indices show that the proposed MADDQN has an average cumulative return of 23.08%, outperforming the other baseline methods. Besides, the multi-agent model demonstrates its advantage in balancing the risk and revenue, in comparison with the single-agent models. Additionally, The generalization experiments confirm that the proposed MADDQN method after pre-training in the proposed mixed dataset could be stably transferred to the other underlying assets with a refinement. These findings indicate that the proposed framework not only achieves good performance in complex financial market environments but also is able to generalize robustly across different scenarios in various markets.

AB In smart agriculture, the accurate prediction of evapotranspiration plays a crucial role in optimizing water usage and maximizing crop yield. However, the increasing adoption of IoT sensor technologies has resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of data, which are frequently contaminated by noise and pose a significant challenge to extract reliable knowledge through data modeling. This research addresses the problem of noisy IoT sensor data and its impact on evapotranspiration prediction, an essential aspect of agricultural practices. The effect of noise on sensor variables and evapotranspiration is extensively analyzed by simulating different noise levels in evapotranspiration datasets collected from various agricultural areas in Spain, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of its impact on the performance of data science models. Despite the potential consequences of this type of errors, a noise preprocessing stage is often overlooked in existing literature in this field, which is necessary to improve data quality prior to modeling. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes the usage of regression noise filters as approach to mitigate the detrimental effects of noisy IoT sensor data on evapotranspiration prediction. Additionally, we introduce the rgnoisefilt R package, which offers a practical and efficient implementation of noise filtering techniques for regression datasets, providing a valuable solution for handling noisy data in smart agriculture applications. The experimental results obtained emphasize the negative impacts of noise on evapotranspiration prediction performance and highlight the importance of an appropriate data treatment to mitigate system deterioration. Furthermore, the findings of this research emphasize the efficacy of the regression noise filters implemented in the rgnoisefilt software, enhancing the performance of the models built and providing a valuable tool for improving data quality in smart agriculture.

AB The cost of software testing could be reduced if faulty entities were identified prior to the testing phase, which is possible with software fault prediction (SFP). In most SFP models, machine learning (ML) methods are used, and one aspect of improving prediction accuracy with these methods is tuning their control parameters. However, parameter tuning has not been addressed properly in the field of software analytics, and the conventional methods (such as basic Differential Evolution, Random Search, and Grid Search) are either not up-to-date, or suffer from shortcomings, such as the inability to benefit from prior experience, or are overly expensive. This study aims to examine and propose parameter tuners, called DEPTs, based on different variants of Differential Evolution for SFP with the Swift-Finalize strategy (to reduce runtime), which in addition to being up-to-date, have overcome many of the challenges associated with common methods. An experimental framework was developed to compare DEPTs with three widely used parameter tuners, applied to four common data miners, on 10 open-source projects, and to evaluate the performance of DEPTs, we used eight performance measures. According to our results, the three tuners out of five DEPTs improved prediction accuracy in more than 70% of tuned cases, and occasionally, they exceeded benchmark methods by over 10% in case of G-measure. The DEPTs took reasonable amounts of time to tune parameters for SFP as well.

AB Deep reinforcement learning is widely used in many fields. However, recent research has found vulnerabilities in agents trained by reinforcement learning algorithms and raised concerns about the deployment of agents in the real world. Due to the addition of imperceptible adversarial examples to the agent's observed state, the policy network is tricked into acting in a suboptimal way. To solve this issue, we introduce an approach, named reinforcement learning under local constraints (RLUC), aimed at bolstering the robustness of agents when countering potent adversarial attacks. Considering the sensitivity of the policy network to the observation state, when adversarial samples are those perturbed by the adversaries injected into the observation states, the policy network generates large fluctuations in the last connection layer. In order to minimize the divergence in the distribution of policy outputs, our method attaches constraints at each layer of the policy network, allowing the agent to stick to the origin action under adversarial attacks. RLUC endeavor to minimize the total variance of the output of actor constructed by neural network layers between polluted state and clean state. RLUC is evaluated and analyzed in different aspects compared to previous excellent works. RLUC underwent evaluation on Mujoco benchmarks and was subjected to testing against six formidable adversarial attacks. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the robustness and smoothness of the agent's policy.

AB The imbalanced data problem is widely recognized in real-world datasets. To avoid learning bias on imbalanced data, the over-sampling strategy is well studied and adopted for generating synthetic minority samples. Wherein, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technology and its improved algorithms become standard baselines. In recent years, the popular Generative Adversarial Networks and its enhanced variants, introduced from the computer vision community, are believed to generate better samples, by approximating the true data distribution. Yet, we notice that the synthetic samples for the minority category in these existing methods is usually restrained in a limited samples space known in advance, which may mislead the classifiers trained on them to take data in the unsampled region of the minority category as from the majority category. Given such limitations, we propose a Generative Adversarial Minority Enlargement (GAME) method to intentionally extend the sampling margin during data generative and adversarial phases. This is accomplished by adjusting the parameters of a local linear model to approach the majority category. We conduct an extensive evaluation on 28 datasets of different domains, extracted from the UCI real-world datasets. The results show that GAME can achieve more balanced and stable results efficiently than 18 state-of-the-art methods.

AB The information volume of mass function (IVMF) is an effective tool for measuring the uncertainty of basic probability assignments in power sets. However, the current IVMF will yield counterintuitive results when applied to an inconsistent frame of discernment (FOD). To address this issue, an improved IVMF based on plausibility transformation method (PTM) is proposed in this paper. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method yields a more reasonable result in cases where the FOD is inconsistent. Additionally, the proposed IVMF can be viewed as a geometric mean of first-order information volume and higher-order information volume, which can degenerate into Shannon Entropy in a probability distribution. The efficacy and rationality of the proposed IVMF are demonstrated through a series of numerical examples and an application in threat assessment.

AB The tourism industry is a key driver of economic growth and contributes to the achievement of sustainability goals. This paper presents a multi-objective group tourist planning problem that considers economic, environmental, and social dimensions simultaneously. The proposed model minimizes total cost and environmental impacts while maximizing the total collected prizes from tourists' interests. We introduce the lost profit opportunity for the cost of tours from an economic perspective for the first time. From an environmental perspective, the model minimizes both carbon emissions for transportation and the waste produced by tourists. Social satisfaction is addressed by considering tourists' preferences for visiting tourist sites and their interests in participating in group tours, maximizing total collected prizes. Uncertainties in travel time and prize values are addressed by using a fuzzy programming approach. A multi-objective adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed multi-objective group tourist planning problem, offering various removal, insertion, and local search heuristic procedures. Extensive analyses and computations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed multi-objective optimization model and the ALNS metaheuristic algorithm in solving large-scale instances. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in aiding tourism managers to make informed decisions that balance economic, environmental, and social objectives.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; PREDICTION STRATEGY
AB In real life, many dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) have both time-varying and non-cyclic properties. Their non-cyclic nature differentiates the dynamics of the problem from all previous moments, and the changes become increasingly complex over time. Therefore, geometric changes in the Pareto-optimal front (PF) are more difficult to track. A novel knee-guided algorithm based on frequency analysis (NKGFA) is designed to solve non-cyclic DMOPs. To identify sufficient feature points to describe the change in PF, a knee-guided prediction strategy based on frequency analysis is proposed. From the perspective of frequency-domain analysis, almost all concave and convex knee points that contain critical feature information on the PF are identified. By predicting the frequency-domain information of the knees, the population's evolutionary trend is obtained in the frequency-domain space. An interpolation strategy based on approximate frontier manifold construction is proposed to ensure that the population is uniformly distributed on the PF. This strategy established an approximate PF between concave and convex knee points. Moreover, it adaptively interpolated the new individuals in the approximate PF. A non-cyclic dynamic (NCD) benchmark test suite is designed, including PFs with increasingly complex geometric features. The effectiveness of the NKGFA is verified by comparing it with four algorithms in the NCD test suite. The NKGFA performed best on 26, 23, and 29 of the 39 test problems on Inverted Generational Distance (IGD), Schott's Spacing Metric (SP), and Hypervolume Difference (HVD), respectively.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an essential part of our daily lives. However, with the increasing use of IoT, the number of botnet attacks targeting resource-constrained IoT devices is also on the rise. To mitigate these threats, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed. However, traditional IDSs based on heavyweight deep/machine learning, fuzzy logic, rough set theories, or data mining techniques, often lack in detection accuracy and energy efficiency. Therefore, there is a crucial need for more lightweight, accurate, and energy-efficient IDSs capable of detecting a broad spectrum of cyber attacks. This paper presents a solution to these challenges by introducing lightweight and accurate IDSs that use a stochastic gradient descent classifier (SGDC) and four feature-selection algorithms based on a ridge regressor. The hyperparameters of the SGDC algorithm and ridge regressor model were fine-tuned to enhance the accuracy of IDSs while reducing computational complexity. Moreover, the fine-tuned feature selectors were used to decrease the dataset's dimensionality and improve the accuracy of IDSs. To evaluate the proposed IDSs, three network traffic datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, BotIoT-2018, and N-BaIoT-2021) were used. The systems achieved an average accuracy of 92.69%, and the number of features was reduced by an average of 79.93%. The results demonstrate that the proposed systems can be utilized for lightweight IDSs on resource-constrained IoT devices. Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of IDSs for IoT devices by offering an efficient and accurate solution. The proposed lightweight IDSs have the potential to enhance IoT security and privacy, safeguarding sensitive IoT data.

AB Visceral leishmaniasis or Kala-azar (KA) is a Vector-Borne Disease (VBD) that remains the second-largest parasitic killer across the globe (mortality rate: 75-95%). More than 60% of KA cases originate in South Asia, wherein India accounts for 2/3rd of the cases, and Bihar, a state in India, alone accounts for more than 50% of the Indian cases. Past studies suspected climate change vulnerabilities as a driving cause of KA outbreaks. The VBDs-based epidemic prediction systems have been developed to mitigate recurrent outbreaks; however, Machine Learning (ML) based approaches still need to be explored for modeling changing climate impacts on KA cases. This study, for the first time, develops a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel-based Support Vector Regression (SVR), hereinafter RBF-kernel-based-SVR model for the most-affected endemic districts of Bihar (northern-India), using the data from 2016 and 2021. Forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression procedures were adopted while selecting influential climatic variables, followed by the k-fold cross-validation technique and, then, the RBF-kernel-based-SVR algorithm for classification. Results suggested that temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and population density significantly contributed to the KA outbreaks. This study also developed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to compare SVR with other classification models. Findings indicated that the proposed RBF-kernel-based-SVR model [Correlation Coefficient (CC) = 0.82, Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) = 12.20, and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.66] outperformed MLR (0.81, 14.20, 0.48) and MLP (0.81, 12.95, 0.61). Study recommends using the RBF-kernel-based-SVR model as a quick and efficient model capable of detecting KA cases with high predictability even under limited data availability. Such models can assist public health authorities, given monitoring KA spread, learning the climate impacts of outbreaks, and ensuring timelier health services.

   neural network; Hierarchical encoding
AB Article comment generation is a new and challenging task in natural language processing, which has recently received much attention from researchers. In the article comment generation, there are apparent distinctions and different perspectives on the comments of a single article. However, current researches ignore the one-to-many relationship between articles and comments, resulting in a lack of diversity and coherence in generated com-ments. To solve this problem, a variational selection mechanism model (VSMM) is proposed in our research. In this model, we construct a Gaussian mixture prior network to capture a richer latent space and generate comments with more diversity and informativeness. At the same time, VSMM maps latent variables into different semantic spaces through the selection mechanism to capture one-to-many relationships. Then we introduce a discrimi-nator to distinguish whether the selected content is consistent with the reference comment content, thus improving the coherence of the generated comments. In addition, a hierarchical encoder with attention is introduced in the VSMM model, which can effectively solve the problem of long document encoding. Further-more, we propose a multi-category article comment dataset to align closely with practical applications. Exper-iments on three datasets demonstrate that VSMM outperforms existing state-of-the-art comment generation methods in terms of diversity in single and multiple comment generations. Moreover, VSMM can generate fluent, diverse, and coherent comments on multi-category and topic-rich datasets.

   networks; POI interaction preferences; POI transfer preferences
AB Recently, POI (Point-of-interest) recommendation for groups has become a critical challenge when helping groups to discover potentially interesting new places, and some effective recommendation models have been proposed to address this issue. However, most existing research focuses on POI recommendation for fixed groups, few studies have been conducted on POI recommendation for occasional groups. To tackle this issue, we propose a POI recommendation model for occasional groups based on Hybrid Graph Neural Networks (termed as PROG-HGNN) which combines excellent graph neural networks models. Firstly, PROG-HGNN generates the fitted representation of the occasional group based on the Node Influence Indicator (INF) method and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) model. Then, PROG-HGNN learns POIs' representations containing members' POI interaction preferences and members' POI transfer preferences with the Signed Bipartite Graph Neural Networks (SBGNN) model and the Session-based Graph Neural Networks (SRGNN) model, respectively. Finally, PROG-HGNN recommends the potential POIs for the occasional group based on the fitted representation of the occasional group and the learned representations of POIs. We verify our proposed model on three public benchmark datasets (Foursquare, Gowalla and Yelp), which contains 124,933 to 860,888 POI check-in records. The comparison between our proposed model and the twelve baseline models demonstrates the outstanding performance of PROG-HGNN. In terms of Precision@K and Recall@K, our model achieves about 32.92% and 19.67% improvement compared with the best baseline models on the three benchmark datasets averagely. Adequate ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the members' POI interaction preferences learning module and POI transfer preferences learning module.

AB As a generalization of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are more capable of representing and addressing uncertainty in real-world problems. As a result, IFSs have been utilized in various areas of application. However, the distance and similarity measures between the two IFSs are still an open issue that has drawn much attention over the past few decades. Even though several intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures (IFSMs) have been developed, a number of issues still exist, including counter-intuitive results, 'the zero divisor problem,' violation of similarity measure axioms, and being incompetent to detect minor changes in membership or non-membership. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure (IFSM) has been introduced in this study. Unlike existing measures, this method considered the global maximum and minimum of differences in memberships and differences in non-memberships, along with their individual differences, to construct an IFSM. Moreover, it has been shown that a convex combination of two similarity measures is also a similarity measure. Some numerical examples are employed to emphasize the advantages and strengths of the proposed method over existing ones. The suggested IFSM has been implemented on a few pattern classification issues to demonstrate its efficacy and a new face recognition method is also presented. Moreover, an entropy measure is introduced using the proposed IFSM, which is further used to construct the weights of attributes in the MADM method. Furthermore, the MADM technique, IF-E-TOPSIS, is constructed using the suggested IFSM and entropy measure. The effectiveness of this method is shown by utilizing it for software quality assessment, and the results are compared with existing ones to highlight the superiority of the proposed method.

AB Designing railway operational planning is a complex and challenging task to cope with fluctuating passenger demand and satisfy actual operational requirements. Focusing on high-speed railway (HSR) lines, this paper proposes an integrated modeling framework for phase-oriented railway operational planning. The framework simultaneously optimizes the stop planning, train timetable problem (TTP) and rolling stock planning (RSP). A multi-objective optimization model, with macro passenger demand, two train speed levels, and overtaking operations taken into account, is formulated to minimize the total train running distance, train dwell time, and rolling stock resources. The constraints involve the train operation zones, train operation process, passenger demand, rolling stock circulation conditions, and actual operational requirements. The proposed model is addressed using a framework based on the epsilon-constraint method, from which an approximate Pareto-optimal solution set is obtained. A case study on the Beijing-Shanghai HSR corridor demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and reveals some trade-offs between the proposed objectives.

AB Decomposed fuzzy sets (DFSs), which have been recently introduced in the field of fuzzy sets are a fuzzy set extension that deals with the membership degree and the non-membership degree of the elements in the set from a functional and dysfunctional point of view in more detail. On the other hand, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) are another fuzzy set extension reflecting the hesitancy of decision-makers in a wider area. The main target of this study is to develop a new fuzzy set extension, decomposed Pythagorean fuzzy sets (DPFSs) in order to utilize the properties of DFSs and PFSs together. First, the basic principles and mathematical operators of the DPFSs are developed with their proofs. Then, a new fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, DPF- Combinative Distance based Assessment (CODAS) is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DPF extension. The developed method is handled in the strategy selection problem for Internet of Things (IoT)based sustainable supply chain systems. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed on both the criteria weights and the decision makers' weights to verify the stability and effectiveness of the obtained results. In addition, a comparative analysis with decomposed fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Pythagorean fuzzy CODAS and Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS methods is presented to show the validity, superiority and advantages of the developed method.

AB The hydrodynamic performance and cavitation development in centrifugal pump have a decisive impact on its energy conversion and performance. However, there are still bottlenecks when using current experimental methods and simulation algorithms in the real-time measurement and visual display of flow fields, and the high experimental and computational cost cannot be ignored. Here, we integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental platform with our customized framework based on a multi-attribute point cloud dataset and advanced deep learning network. This combination is made possible by our workflow to generate simulated data of flow characteristics of cavitation in the pump as the training/ test dataset, complete the deep learning algorithm process and check the consistency with the experimental results. Deep learning models the multiphase flow system of centrifugal pump and completes the mapping from the structure of pump and working conditions to the cavitation, pressure, and velocity field. The statistical analysis shows that predictions results are in agreement with the CFD method, but the calculation time is greatly reduced. Compared to the prevalent methods, the proposed deep learning framework shows superior performance in accuracy, computational cost, visual display and has the potential of generality to model the interaction between different fluids and impellers.

AB With the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies climbing, the cryptocurrency market has become the most popular investment area in recent years. Unlike other relatively more stable financial derivatives, the cryptocurrency market has high volatility which requires a high-frequency prediction model for quantitative trading. However, the excessive number of trading becomes a critical issue due to the instability of the prediction results and high error rate. To relieve such a problem, based on the observation of high frequency data, we use local minimum series to replace the original series and propose a more stable triple trend labeling method that reduces the number of trades by potentially influencing the training of the model. In addition, a new attention-based CNN-LSTM model for multiple cryptocurrencies (ACLMC) is proposed to optimize model effects by exploiting correlations across frequencies and currencies, and to smooth out the investment risk associated with prediction errors by supporting simultaneous multi-currency predictions. Experiments show that our labeling method with ACLMC can achieve much better financial metrics and fewer number of transactions than traditional baselines.

AB People enjoy spending time in the wilderness for numerous reasons. However, they occasionally get lost or injured, and their survival depends on being efficiently found and rescued in the shortest possible time. A search and rescue operation (SAR) is launched after the accident is reported, and all possible resources are activated. The inclusion of drones in SAR operations has enabled the use of computer vision methods to detect persons in aerial imagery automatically. When searching by drone, preference is given to oblique photographs that cover a larger area within a single image, reducing the search time. Unlike vertical photographs, oblique photographs include a significant scale change, making it challenging to locate a person in the real world and determine their distance from the drone. In order to solve this problem, encouraged by our previous successful simulations, we explored the possibility of applying the raycast method for person geolocalization and distance determination for use in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a system able to precisely geolocate persons automatically detected in offline processed images recorded during the SAR mission. After a series of experiments on terrains of different configurations and complexity, using a custom-made 3D terrain generator and raycaster, along with a deep neural network-based person detector trained on our custom dataset, we defined a method for geolocating detected person based on raycast, which allows using low-cost commercial drones with a monocular camera and no Real-Time Kinematic module while enabling laser rangefinder emulation during offline image analysis. Our person geolocating method overcomes the problems faced by previous methods and, using a single flight sequence with only 4 consecutive detections, significantly outperforms the previous best results, with reliability of 42,85% (geolocating error of 0.7 m on recording from a 30 m height). Also, a short time of only 247 s enables offline processing of data recorded during a 21-minute drone flight covering approximately an area of 10 ha, proving that the proposed method can be effectively used in actual SAR missions. We also proposed a new evaluation metric (ErrDist) for person geolocalization and provided recommendations for using the proposed system for person detection and geolocation in real-world scenarios.

ID DRYING PROCESS
AB The quality and economic value of cigarettes depend heavily on the quality of tobacco curing, which is greatly influenced by the temperature rise time during the process. Accurately setting the temperature rise time is crucial in creating the right curing environment to achieve high-quality tobacco leaf curing. However, accurate recognition of the different stages of tobacco curing is a complex process that involves multiple sources of feature data for comprehensive analysis. The impact factor of each feature changes with the curing conditions, making it difficult for existing models to account for errors and adjust to changes in data-fusion schemes. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic data-fusion scheme based on the voting method strategy using the extreme gradient enhancement algorithm and data-fusion method. Additionally, a comprehensive baking prediction model (CBPM) is introduced, which integrates the state recognition fusion model and multiple temperature rise time prediction models to accurately recognize curing states and set the temperature rise time accordingly. CBPM is designed to incorporate curing expertise and can automatically adjust the data-fusion strategy with the change of impact factors of multi-source data to meet the demand for comprehensive data analysis in prediction. Through experimental comparison, it is concluded that CBPM outperforms existing models, with a recognition macro F1-Score of the curing state at 98.4% and a mean absolute error of prediction of the temperature rise time of 0.541. This data-fusion and model integration method can provide effective technical support for other curing production fields.

AB The study of High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM) and Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is crucial since it explains consumer behavior and offers actionable advice to improve business results. HUIM algorithms have been suc-cessfully established to identify high-utility itemsets, including those with negative utilities. The problem with these approaches is that they presume incorrectly that items with negative utility across transactions would always be losses. Products with positive profitability may seem negative when combined with other items to increase sales or reduce inventory. Using strict upper-bound approaches, this paper presents strategies for making database scanning more efficient and reducing the number of prospective candidates. We also prove that it is correct to use the proposed upper-bounds for pruning on several types of items in the database. Based on all the proposed solutions, we develop a novel algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. To demonstrate their efficiency, the algorithms are tested against states-of-art HUIM algorithm on diverse datasets with regard to size and characteristics with unstable negative profits.

AB It is unquestionable that hesitant fuzzy set has developed into an important tool for handling uncertain data. As a measure between data, hesitant fuzzy entropy is significant in the decision-making process. However, existing entropy measures have a series of problems such as anti intuition. In the decision-making problem under hesitant fuzzy frameworks, traditional decision-making methods such as TOPSIS method assume that the decision-maker is absolutely rational, which also makes the calculation results unreasonable. Therefore, the present study provides a comprehensive hesitant fuzzy entropy. Additionally, the traditional TOPSIS method is enhanced based on the cumulative prospect theory and the entropy method, thereby generating a multi attribute decision-making model with unknown attribute weights. First, a new axiomatic definition of hesitant fuzzy entropy is given, then the comprehensive hesitant fuzzy entropy is defined based on the two features of fuzziness and unclarity. Besides, we prove that our method meets the new axiomatic definition. Finally, the improved TOPSIS method is applied to evaluate the comprehensive entropy measure, while simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results showed that compared to existing entropy measures, the comprehensive hesitant fuzzy entropy more accurately reflects the uncertainty of hesitant fuzzy elements, and also has the advantages of simple calculation and easy understanding. Meanwhile, the improved TOPSIS method takes into account the psychological preferences of decision-makers, which is more reasonable than traditional methods.

AB Inspired by the production model of pressure vessels for spacecraft, i.e., tanks and cylinders, this study addresses the sequence-dependent group flow shop scheduling problem with consistent sublots (SDGFSP_CS) to minimize makespan and total energy consumption. In the problem under consideration, there are several coupling subproblems, namely, the group sequencing, job sequencing, lot assignment, and machine speed assignment. To solve these problems, a multi-population cooperative multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MPCMOEA) is proposed. In the MPCMOEA, a hybrid initial method that combines two problem-specific heuristics is designed to generate high-quality initial solutions. Then, considering the problem features, a cooperative mechanism considering the co-evolution of multi-population and the archive set is designed to accelerate the optimization process. In the co-evolutionary stage, to deepen the exploitation ability of local search, an enhanced search with multiple problem-specific operators is implemented. Furthermore, a re-initialization method is developed to improve the global search abilities. Finally, 27 different scale instances are generated for a series of numerical experiments. For the hypervolume and inverse generational distance metrics, MPCMOEA gets 20/27 and 21/27 optimal values, respectively. It verifies that the MPCMOEA outperforms efficient algorithms in terms of the diversity and convergence performance.

AB Extracting robust features from surface electromyogram (sEMG) for accurate pattern recognition is a central research topic in biomechanics and human-machine interaction. Although related topics have been extensively investigated, the robustness of the recognition models over the inter-subject and inter-session signal variabilities remains challenging. From the perspective of feature projection, here we have proposed and validated the concept of sEMG feature disentanglement. We used an autoencoder-like architecture with specialized loss functions to explicitly decompose the sEMG features into the pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The former can be applied to robust sEMG pattern recognition, while the latter can be used as task-independent biometric identifiers. The proposed method was evaluated on data from twenty subjects with training and testing data acquired 3-25 days apart. The hand gesture recognition performance under the rigorous cross-subject and cross-day validation protocols demonstrates the proposed concept, showing a significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work provides a new insight into developing robust sEMG-based pattern recognition models. Moreover, it also indicates several exciting research directions in sEMG analysis, like task-independent sEMG biometric, sEMG privacy-preserving, and sEMG style-transfer.

AB Fog computing is a promising computing paradigm for the processing and storage of massive data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Fog computing devices have limited resources compared to the cloud. Meanwhile, the dynamism and heterogeneity of applications requested from IoT devices require quick decisions on where to process services on the fog, the cloud, or the hybrid. This problem is known as Fog Service Placement (FSP), which is a computationally NP-hard problem. Therefore, the efficient allocation of fog resources to IoT services by non-deterministic algorithms is emphasized. In this paper, a Quality of Service (QoS)-aware deployment scheme is proposed using an evolutionary approach to address the FSP problem. Here, several new evolutionary approaches such as Teaching Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO), Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) and Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) are analyzed to solve the problem. We improve the evolutionary approach used to solve the FSP problem with a shared parallel architecture and perform distributed fog resource management. In addition, we bring the processing closer to the fog network by considering the priority of service execution. Here, we formulate a multi-objective function as an optimization problem that simultaneously considers delay cost, delay violation, service cost and fog utilization. All the parameters needed to configure the objective function are collected based on the incoming traffic. The simulations show the superiority of HBA for solving the FSP problem. The evaluation results show that the proposed placement scheme improves the cost and delay compared to the best existing method by 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively.

AB Despite their high risk, cryptocurrencies have gained popularity as viable trading options. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that experience significant fluctuations in a market operating 24 h a day. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to developing trading bots using machine-learning-based artificial intelligence. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques to predict financial market trends or make trading decisions, primarily using numerical data extracted from candlesticks. However, these data often overlook the temporal and spatial information of candlesticks, leading to a limited understanding of their significance. In this study, we utilize multi-resolution candlestick images containing temporal and spatial information. Our rationale for using visual information from candlestick charts is to replicate the decision-making processes of human trading experts. To achieve this, we employ deep reinforcement learning algorithms to generate trading signals based on a state vector that includes embedded candlestick-chart images. The trading signal is generated using a multi-agent weighted voting ensemble approach. We test the proposed approach on two BTC/USDT datasets under both bullish and bearish market scenarios. Additionally, we use an attention-based technique to identify significant areas in the candlestick images targeted by the proposed approach. Our findings demonstrate that models using candlestick images 'as-is', outperform those using raw numeric data and other baseline models.

AB In this paper, the synchronization control of discrete-time complex dynamical networks (CDNs) is studied under the framework of intermittent networked communication. To reduce transmission frequency, a novel aperiodic intermittent event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with discontinuous characteristics is proposed. Under this mechanism, the controller only works within predetermined working intervals, and whether the control signal is updated depends on a preset triggering condition. In addition, an exponential term is designed in this mechanism to achieve integration and correlation between the intermittent mechanism and the ETM, which depends on the initial instants of the working intervals. Compared with the existing ETMs, this mechanism saves communication and computing resources effectively. To improve flexibility in the design of working/rest intervals, the concepts of average working time ratio (AWTR) and average working period (AWP) are introduced to describe intermittent aperiodic performance. A sufficient criterion for the synchronization of discrete-time CDNs is obtained, and the feasible domain of AWTR is calculated. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Computed Tomography Report Generation (CTRG) aims to generate medical reports towards a series of radiological images, which is an advancement of the conventional X-ray report generation (generating one medical description only based on a single X-ray snapshot). Beyond the difficulties faced in the traditional task, CTRG requires the model to filter out the lesion regions from sequential scans, producing a fine-grained report that conforms to medical logic and common sense. Limited to available datasets, there are few methods trying to tackle this task. Besides, although densely aggregating sequential features may be beneficial, it introduces extra noise. Moreover, radiology reports are long narratives composed of abnormal descriptions and template sentences, but most studies ignore this hierarchical nature and generate the entire reports uniformly. This paper aims to bridge the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we develop two large-scale clinical datasets termed CTRG-Brain-263K and CTRG-Chest-548K, which contain 263670 brain CT scans and 548696 chest CT scans with authoritative diagnosis reports, respectively. Second, we design a self-attention-based Scan Localizer (SL) that captures a representation most reflective of the lesion area. And a reconstruction loss is introduced to minimize the distance between focused and original scans. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Generator (DG) that decouples the decoder into abnormal and template branches, with produced proposals dynamically aggregated for the final generation. Experimental results confirm the proposed SL-DG outperforms existing methods, i.e., about +5.2% and +0.4% CIDEr points on CTRG-Brain-263K and CTRG-Chest-548K, respectively.

AB In industrial environments, individual sensor is easily affected by background noise, etc. In order to improve the reliability of anomaly detections, sensors are arranged at multiple measuring points to collect monitoring data of machines. However, under the coupling of vibration responses of multiple components of machines, the complex nonlinear relationship between monitoring data of multiple measuring points makes it difficult to achieve the best feature extraction and fusion effect, which reduces the accuracy of anomaly detection. To solve this problem, an unsupervised spatiotemporal fusion network augmented with random mask and time-relative information modulation is proposed. Firstly, we creatively propose random mask and modulated signal generation method based on mask index to learn the dependence of waveform and time dimension and achieve temporal dimension fusion of signals. Based on end-to-end training, modulated signals are also more conducive to spatial fusion. Then, to fully exploit the correlation between monitoring data of multiple measuring points and obtain the best spatial dimension fusion effect, a multi-head graph neural network based on self-attention weight matrix is carried out. Finally, we use transformer encoder to reconstruct the signal of each measuring point and obtain reconstruction error. Based on exponentially weighted moving average, anomaly detection threshold is obtained. Two anomaly detection experiments are conducted, and accuracy of 99.78%, 99% are achieved.

AB The research community has extensively utilized biometrics, which is one of the most prominent sources of knowledge for authentication schemes in the rapidly advancing field of cybersecurity. Among various types of biometric information, an individual's electrocardiogram (ECG) plot serves as an inimitable object as it cannot be faked intentionally. For large-scale applications, where granting access to genuine signal owners is necessary, deep learning is an essential component. In this context, the convergence between one-dimensional representations and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) includes prospective solutions. To capture the time-series data from a different perspective, hereby, we propose the VisGIN model which utilizes GINConv for the convolutional layers and passes Visibility Graphs (VG) as input. In parallel with our intuition, the findings of this study affirmed the fruition of the VisGIN approach, offering significant implications for the field of ECG authentication. By achieving an average classification accuracy of 99.76% in the evaluation of grant-access decisions, our VisGIN model demonstrates the effectiveness of graph machine learning models for time-series binary classification tasks, particularly in ECG authentication. As a result, our study provides a valuable advancement in enhancing the security and reliability of authentication systems. Researchers and practitioners can benefit from our work by leveraging the VisGIN model and its graph-based approach to bolster the accuracy and robustness of ECG authentication systems.

AB A technique of analysis of thermal images of minigrinders is presented in the paper. The following states of minigrinders were analyzed: healthy minigrinder (HM), minigrinder with 2 blocked air vents (M2BAV), and minigrinder with 4 blocked air vents (M4BAV). The thermal imaging camera was shivering vertically (0-1.5 [m/ s2]). Two methods are proposed for the computation of essential areas of thermal images: DTILE (Differences of Thermal Images using Local Entropy), and DPTILE (Differences of Power of Thermal Images using Local Entropy). The computed areas are compared to each other using the Nearest Neighbor. Moreover, verification of the analysis of thermal images was carried out for the convolutional neural networks GoogLeNet and ResNet-50. The analyzed approaches were proper for fault diagnosis. The efficiency of recognition is equal to 100% for the three analyzed classes. The presented approach can be also used in the industry.

DE Arnold 's cat map; Encryption; Random-data; Known-text attack;
   Interlaced chaotic transform
ID IMAGE ENCRYPTION; ALGORITHM
AB We present a novel data encryption approach that utilizes a cascaded chaotic map application. The chaotic map used in both permutation and diffusion is Arnold's Cat Map (ACM), where the transformation is periodic and the encrypted data can be recovered. The original format of ACM is a two-dimensional mapping, and therefore it is suitable to randomize the pixel locations in an image. Since the values of pixels stay intact during the transformation, the process cannot encrypt an image, and known-text attacks can be used to get back the transformation matrix. The proposed approach uses ACM to shuffle the positions and values of two-dimensional data in an interlaced and nested process. This combination extends the period of the transformation, which is significantly longer than the period of the initial transformation. Furthermore, the nested process's possible combinations vastly expand the key space. At the same time, the interlaced pixel and value transformation makes the encryption highly resistant to any known-text attacks. The encrypted data passes all random-data tests proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Any type of data, including ASCII text, can be encrypted so long as it can be rearranged into a two-dimensional format.

AB In the existing researches about partial disassembly line balancing problem (PDLBP), all workstations are assumed always be available. In the real world, however, aging and failure of machines are inevitable, which may result in the shutdown of the whole disassembly line. To solve this problem, this study introduces preventive maintenance scenarios into PDLBP to prevent unexpected breakdowns and promote the productivity and smoothness of the disassembly line. Then, considering the substantial level of uncertainty in the state of end-oflife products, a multi-objective fuzzy mathematical model is established to minimize the cycle time, disassembly profit, and total assignment plan alteration simultaneously. And an enhanced hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm is developed to solve it. The attribute-driven heuristic strategy is applied to improve the quality of initial food sources, and the adaptive neighborhood search is designed to improve the exploitation efficiency of the employed bees and onlooker bees. Additionally, a hybrid global learning strategy is developed to guide the scout bees to raise the diversity of food sources. Finally, three case studies are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance.

AB Aquatic animals have rheotaxis that maintains a balance in response to water flow. They sense water flow through hair cells in lateral line, thereby leading to behavior changes relevant to damages on hair cells, the primary sensory receptor cells within auditory and vestibular systems. Zebrafish are efficient animal models for high-throughput drug screening with human-like hair cells along the lateral line. Their rheotactic behaviors could be assays for hair-cell-targeted drug screening. However, knowledge and tools for rheotaxis analysis along the extent of hair-cell damage have not been fully investigated. This article aims at characterization of rheotactic behaviors identifying lateral line states via an analysis platform that simultaneously examines multiple zebrafish larvae. To this end, we developed an automated framework that incorporated animal test hardware equipment and real-time analysis software for monitoring aquatic behaviors of multiple larvae. Through this framework, a commensurable measure for one-dimensional characterization of rheotactic behaviors was consolidated so that its linear changes could be associated with the population of hair cells remaining intact. These findings satisfied requests for an automated analysis platform to conduct large-scale screening and a biomarker that discriminate the seriousness of hair cell damage to screen candidates having significant effects in otoprotective drug discovery.

AB In this study, we estimate the generalization of the performance of previously proposed predictive models for nutrient value prediction across different recipe datasets. For this purpose, we introduce a quantitative indicator that determines the level of generalization of using the developed predictive model for new unseen data not presented in the training process. On a predefined corpus of recipe embeddings from six publicly available recipe datasets (i.e., projecting them in the same meta-feature vector space), we train predictive models on one of the six recipe datasets and test the models on the rest of the datasets. In parallel, we define and calculate generalizability indexes which are numbers that indicate how generalizable a predictive model is i.e., how well will a predictive model learned on one dataset perform on another one not involved in the training. The evaluation results prove the validity of these indexes - their relation with the accuracy of the predictions. Further, we define three sampling techniques for selecting representative data instances that will cover all parts from the feature space uniformly (involving data from all datasets) and further will improve the generalization of a predictive model. We train predictive models with these generalized datasets and test them on instances from the six recipe datasets that are not selected and included in the generalized datasets. The results from the evaluation of these predictive models show improvement compared to the results from the predictive models trained on one recipe dataset and tested on the others separately.

AB Before the terms "smart city" and "floating city" were introduced, the world's population had increased and land shortage across the world was already widely recognized. As a first challenge, the previous studies have developed the concept of a smart city as a creative answer, following that, several scientists proposed the floating city concept in the literature as a solution to the increased sea levels. Moreover, engineers, architects, and designers deal with city planning, for smart and floating settlements as a difficult design challenge, and evolutionary algorithms could be employed to address this complex problem by optimizing residents' needs. As a continuation of our previous studies on this topic, this time, we develop a multi-objective continuous genetic algorithm with differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy (MO_CGADE) and a multi-objective ensemble differential evolution algorithm (MO_EDE) to solve the problem on hand. Then, we compare the performance of the MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) to maximize two conflicted objective functions, namely, scenery, and walkability in the proposed smart floating city model created in the Grasshopper Algorithmic Modeling Environment. The parametric model that we create in the Grasshopper software includes 64 decision variables, area constraints and objective functions to be optimized by MO_CGADE, MO_EDE, and NSGAII algorithms. Computational results show that MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms generate better Pareto ranking results than the traditional NSGAII algorithm in terms of cardinality, distribution spacing, and coverage metrics.

AB This paper develops a new adaptive surrogate model method for structural reliability analysis, which is constructed by approximating the limit state function (LSF) using stochastic configuration network (SCN) ensemble model. The proposed ensemble model integrates three SCN base models and sets weights for each prediction result, reducing outliers and greatly improving the output accuracy and stability of the algorithm. In constructing a surrogate model for reliability analysis, a new adaptive sampling strategy is designed, including a novel learning function. The new strategy enables the most informative sample points are selected and significantly reduce the number of required sample point. Without further calls to the LSF, the structural failure probability is quickly evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation in terms of the constructed SCN ensemble surrogate model. Three benchmark problems, including a highly nonlinear problem with small failure probability and two multivariable engineering structural problems, are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper mainly discusses the joint optimization of product assortment, inventory and pricing for an omnichannel retailer under uncertain demand, seeking to maximize the retailer's Worst-case Conditional Value-atRisk (WCVaR) based profit and customer's expected utility. The risk aversion of decision-maker and the time preference of customers are depicted by the WCVaR and quasi-hyperbolic discounting function, respectively. A bi-objective stochastic optimization model is developed. To alleviate the computational burden, a linearization method is applied to convert the problem into a mixed integer linear programming that proves to be solvable within reasonable CPU times using the augmented epsilon-constraint method. Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the applicability of the proposed model and the efficiency of the solution approach. Our experimental results show that offering customers with high expected utility typically requires low prices and small assortments. We also make other counterintuitive observation that the price of products sometimes increases when the expected utility increases. Furthermore, WCVaR has superiority compared with the risk-neutral model in terms of robustness and stability. The time preference of customers has non-negligible impacts on decision-making results. In addition, the further sensitivity analyses investigate the impacts of various key parameters on the performance of omnichannel retailing.

AB Scientific papers, as pivotal tools for academic communication, should be articulated with clarity and precision to ensure the effective conveyance of scholarly ideas and to prevent reader confusion. Yet, many such papers conspicuously lack in-depth research, and their core content is often ambiguously presented. This pattern poses a significant impediment to the progressive evolution of science and technology. While numerous researchers have recognized this widespread challenge, a holistic theoretical or methodological solution remains elusive in the academic realm. To bridge this gap, we introduce the INTEGrity vERification (INTEGER) task. This task aids researchers in assessing the integrity of their papers by verifying the clarity of each knowledge unit. To implement this task on text, we propose a multi-task learning model that utilizes the Tucker decomposition and span-level attention mechanism to identify terms and their integrity precisely. More specifically, to provide insights into the INTEGER task and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect 8076 sentences and construct three new datasets containing various types of terms and descriptions in different domains. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model has an average performance improvement of 1.1% F1 over the three datasets compared to a series of state-of-the-art baseline methods.

AB This research suggests the use of neural network observers based on fuzzy auxiliary sliding mode control for the fault estimation and isolation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle sensors. The fuzzy auxiliary sliding-modecontrol-based adaptive approach for neural network observer is used for the approximation, reconstruction, and isolation of unknown faults by utilizing the multi-layer neural network. The neural network weight parameters are updated adaptively by using the fuzzy auxiliary sliding-mode-control approach. In conventional neural networks, the gradient descent approach-based back-propagation procedures are adapted for the training of the neural network. In this research, a new concept of the nonlinear controller such as the fuzzy auxiliary sliding-mode-control method is adapted for neural network online training, in which the fuzzy auxiliary slidingmode-control is used as the learning approach; the neural network is used as a control process that calculates the stable and dynamic learning rates. By the consideration of unknown faults diagnosis and isolation, the online learning approach used in this research has shown the faults estimation, reconstruction, and isolation abruptly and with high accuracy compared to conventional approaches as well the approach used in literature. Strategies adopted in the literature are not capable of fault detection, estimation, and reconstruction with high accuracy and abruptness compared to the method adopted in this research. The presented approach is validated by using the nonlinear dynamics of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles, results show the accuracy, abruptness, and efficiency compared to the algorithms adapted in the literature. It is suggested that the proposed strategy can be integrated into nonlinear systems fault diagnosis, fault isolation, and for increasing the system performance.

AB Accurate and massive medical image annotation data is crucial for diagnosis, surgical planning, and deep learning in the development of medical images. However, creating large annotated datasets is challenging because labeling medical images is complicated, laborious, and time-consuming and requires expensive and professional medical skills. To significantly reduce the cost of labeling, an interactive image annotation framework based on composite geodesic distance is proposed, and medical images are labeled through segmentation. This framework uses Attention U-net to obtain initial segmentation based on adding user interaction to indicate incorrect segmentation. Another Attention U-net takes the user's interaction with the initial segmentation as input. It uses a composite geodesic distance transform to convert the user's interaction into constraints, giving accurate segmentation results. To further improve the labeling efficiency for large datasets, this paper validates the proposed framework against the segmentation background of a self-built prostate MRI image datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in less interactive annotation and less time than traditional interactive annotation methods with better Dice and Jaccard results. This has important implications for improving medical diagnosis, surgical planning, and the development of deep-learning models in medical imaging.

AB Deep learning (DL) has made its way into many disciplines ranging from health care to self-driving cars. In financial markets, we see a rich literature for DL applications. Particularly, investors require robust algorithms that can navigate and make sense of extremely noisy and volatile markets. In this work, we use deep learning to select a portfolio of stocks and use a genetic algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of DL. The work analyzes the improvement in using genetic-based hyperparameter optimization over grid searches. The Genetic Algorithm brings 40% improvements in prediction when compared to a random-grid search. Novelty-wise, the work couples a genetic-based hyperparameter optimization with multiple Deep RankNet models to predict the behavior of financial assets. Our results show promising portfolio returns 20% better than the general market. In the highly volatile COVID 19 period, the models exceed market returns by more than double. Overall, this paper brings a comprehensive work that integrates hyperparameter optimization, Deep RankNet, LSTM, period size variations, input variable transformation, feature selection, training/evaluation ratio analysis, and multiple portfolio selection strategies.

AB We present an investigation of the generation of partially absorbing continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) for the purpose of approximating transient analysis of the underlying Markov chain. The Markov chain model of a car-sharing system, considering realistic parameter values such as fleet size and number of zones, is too large to be analyzed in its entirety. To obtain an approximate estimation of the changes in system characteristics starting from a given initial state, it is sufficient to generate and analyze a small fraction of the complete CTMC. We address the problem of identifying which states should be included for analysis by employing subgraph generation algorithms. The numerical results validate some of our insights about the problem and also provide suggestions for further research.

AB Healthcare is a knowledge intensive process, which requires large amount of information from various healthcare knowledge providers. However, this growing information makes challengeable for users in finding useful healthcare information to support their healthcare decision making. Knowledge management and knowledge management systems are drawing increasing attention in healthcare community. This paper proposes an online healthcare knowledge management framework and system prototype, featured with integrating knowledge learning and exploratory search for solving problems efficiently. Inspired by the knowledge to action framework in healthcare and the iterative process in software engineering, an iterative and incremental knowledge management model is designed to organize the activities during the knowledge learning and searching procedure. Supported by the knowledge-enhanced infrastructure of online healthcare information designed, domain knowledge learning and task knowledge learning environment can work collaboratively and interactively to improve the result of learning and exploratory search. Knowledge base also provides helpful information in an interactive way for solving problems. Given exploiting probabilistic information retrieval model and concept semantics described in Description Logics, a search intent discovery method and search intent guided learning and searching mechanism are designed within this environment for achieving the learning and search goal. The results of the experiments have proved the efficacy of the methods and process model used in the leaning-focused healthcare knowledge management system.

ID TRACHEAL SUCTION
AB Sputum deposition has always been a significant problem in patients with mechanical ventilation. If not handled in time, it can induce bacterial infection and even endanger the life safety of patients. Currently, the evaluation of sputum deposition heavily depends on the medical staff's clinical experience. This paper designs a sputum deposition monitoring system that realizes remote airway pressure and flow signals collection and management for mechanically ventilated patients. Forty-six patients in the intensive care unit were involved in this study. Meanwhile, a one-dimensional convolution neural networks model was proposed to classify four sputum deposition categories (no, slight, moderate, and severe). The experimental results showed that the overall classification accuracy could reach more than 78%. Moreover, the model has been optimized for practical application by setting thresholds for the output of the softmax layer. Finally, the classification accuracy of no sputum, slight, moderate, and severe deposition reaches 85.84%, 84.29%, 93.19%, and 93.38%, respectively. This study's proposed system and method could significantly increase the automation and intelligence of medical care.

DE Probabilistic prediction; Distribution-free; Mixture of Gaussian
   distribution; Unbiased mean estimation
AB Machine learning techniques have been widely used and are mostly performed by predicting point estimation. Nevertheless, there are various scenarios that require more information beyond only point estimation. Probabilistic prediction is a typical research topic that provides probability distribution while predicting, which addressed with much attention recently. Most of the previous works make an assumption on the probabilistic distribution to a certain extent, which may lead to potential errors in the subsequent decision making procedure. In this paper, we propose a distribution-free method for regression problems on real-value response under the probabilistic prediction framework and present an effective boosting-based method to perform the training process. Moreover, we introduce a further improved method to accomplish an unbiased mean estimation of the target distribution. Thorough experiments on multiple benchmark data are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with regard to different measures.

ID FORMABILITY
AB Metal bending tubes have been widely used in various fields owing to their excellent performance; however, bending defects significantly affect their quality. This study proposes a tangential variable boosting (TVB) scheme to reduce the severity of multiple defects generated during the rotary draw bending (RDB). The boosting pressure die is divided into several parts. Different process parameters were applied to the divided semi-parts based on the tangential stress distribution trend. To explore the effects of the TVB, a cross-sectional defect prediction method is proposed based on a parameter-weight-adaptive convolutional neural network (PWA-CNN). To validate the proposed prediction method, a dataset for training the prediction model was constructed using a series of numerical simulations of aluminum-alloy tubes. The prediction results of the PWA-CNN were then compared with those of the other CNNs and different weight assignment methods. The comparison results show that the PWA-CNN exhibits the best performance in predicting the tube cross-sectional distortion. Finally, the effects of the TVB on the forming quality of the bending tubes were obtained. A reasonable TVB is beneficial for reducing the wall-thinning and contour distortion ratios of the tubes and has a negligible effect on the short-axis variation rate.

AB The stable control of product quality when abnormal working conditions occur in the industrial production process is essential to improve product quality and economic efficiency. However, the process industry suffers from multivariate, nonlinear, uncertainty, long time delays and frequent failures, making its modeling and control difficult. In this paper, a novel method of neural network model predictive control integrated process monitoring (PM-NNMPC) is proposed. First, the combination of gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network (GRU-CNN) is used to extract the features from the time and the space separately to build prediction models for different working conditions of the process. Then, a process monitoring and fault diagnosis method of principal component analysis combined with deep neural network and XGBoost (PCA-DNN-XGBoost) is designed to monitor the working conditions in real-time and diagnose accurately when faults occur. Finally, a new operation control framework integrating process monitoring and fault diagnosis into the model prediction control is designed to solve the problem that equipment operation failure, which makes the product quality fluctuation because of the model mismatch and the system runaway. The experimental results of hot rolling process show that PM-NNMPC can effectively control the system under normal working conditions and in case of the system failure to ensure the stable product quality.

DE Subtype classification; Histopathological data; Interpretable diagnosis;
   Attention mechanism; Weakly supervised
AB AI-powered analysis of histopathology data has become an invaluable assistant for pathologists due to its efficiency and accuracy. However, existing deep learning methods still face some challenges in specifying cancer subtypes. For example, the ultra-high resolution of histopathological slides generally contains numerous redundant features, which are not useful for cancer subtype classification and thus lead to considerable computational costs. Moreover, the lack of manual annotations of disease-specific regions (i.e., patch-level annotations) from experts makes it more difficult to learn such histological features with only slide-level labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly supervised learning framework called EWSLF to address these issues. First, we employ a cluster-based sampling strategy to refine the histological features for further training, which can improve classification accuracy and reduce computational cost. Second, we employ a multi-branch attention mechanism to produce patch-level pseudo-labels and aggregate the patch features into slide-level features, which can complement the missing patch-level labels from experts. Experimental results on both public and in-house datasets demonstrate the superiority and credible results of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods for cancer subtype classification.

AB 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize industrial manufacturing through efficient and sustainable techniques. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a broadly deployed technique among various 3D printing methods. However, the surface quality of FDM is greatly influenced by multiple factors, making it challenging to unravel the relationship between printing quality and parameter settings. To break through this bottleneck, this study proposes an intelligent approach that combines Transfer Learning (TL)-based Feature Extractor (FE) and Gradient-Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) to investigate the effects of FDM printing parameters on surface quality. Experiments are conducted in the laboratory to validate the effectiveness of the FE-GBDT, which is then compared with the exemplary Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The results show that our proposed TL model can achieve high precision and accuracy over 0.9900, demonstrating the efficacy of FE-GBDT in deciphering the impact of FDM printing parameters on surface quality. The contribution of each parameter is evaluated and indicates that layer height could dramatically affect the surface quality with an importance score of 0.626. The results provide valuable insights for the 3D printing community, proving that the FE-GBDT approach offers improved generalization, faster training, enhanced feature extraction, addressing data scarcity, and the ability to leverage the strengths of both approaches for superior performance across various tasks.

AB The presence of Beggiatoa Spp. indicates anoxic conditions or 'poor condition' in marine sediments beneath aquaculture pens, resulting from organic enrichment. Currently, the most efficient approach to estimate Beggiatoa Spp. coverage, and thus the extent of the issue, involves video surveys which are scored by human observers for presence of this bacteria. However, this approach is highly time-consuming and relies heavily on the expertise and experience of the individuals involved, thus affecting its accuracy. Machine learning-based computer vision techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer the potential for automated estimation of Beggiatoa Spp. coverage. However, most existing machine learning methods focus solely on the estimation of the coverage via presence, absence of a single type of Beggiatoa Spp.. These approaches typically rely on binary classification to distinguish the object from the background when estimating coverage. Nevertheless, the inclusion of subordinate categories within high-level classifications poses a great challenge for accurately estimating their coverage rates. In this paper, an adaptive ensemble learning approach was proposed to estimate Beggiatoa Spp. coverage. Unlike other approaches, the proposed approach is capable in adaptively extracting and fusing features from underwater images and accurately estimating the coverages of multiple types of Beggiatoa Spp. through ensemble learning. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms other approaches in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in estimating Beggiatoa Spp. coverage.

AB This paper proposes a novel 3D point cloud segmentation network called EDGCNet. Structurally, the network combines the encoder-decoder structure and graph convolution to improve the processing efficiency and the exploration of point-to-point correlation. In addition, it contains two sub-modules: the dynamic hyperbaric graph convolution module and the dual squeeze-and-attention module. To mitigate the issue of incorrect inference in existing graph convolution networks for multi-category hybrid regions, the dynamic hyperbolic graph convolution module maps the features captured in the Euclidean space to the hyperbolic space to aggregate the neighborhoods and dynamically update the edge weights. Compared to Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic embedding with learnable curvature can deeply fit the geometric topology of point cloud by transforming the manifold shape to enrich feature representation. The dual squeeze-and-attention module recalibrates the original features by modeling the correlation between channels from both global and local perspectives to improve the feature shift caused by the deepening of the convolution. Empirical experiments on three public datasets verify that EDGCNet has an excellent segmentation effect on both artificial shapes and real scenes. Furthermore, ablation studies and confirmatory experiments show that the modules in EDGCNet are contributing, low-complexity and robust.

AB Purpose: Since the pollution from the transportation sector has become intolerable in urban areas, many authorities are beginning to ban vehicles powered by fossil fuels. In this scenario, electric vehicle (EV) mobility is the only viable option for the transportation sector. Despite the fact that EVs offer a number of advantages over fuel-powered vehicles, it can be challenging for a purchaser to select a model due to its technical features and their lack of knowledge about EVs. This article aims to assist purchasers of EV by constructing an MCDM problem with multiple features as criteria and EV models as alternatives.Design/methodology/approach: The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method ranks alternatives to a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem based on the distance between the positive and negative ideal solutions. Even though the TOPSIS methodology has several fuzzy enhancements, it is difficult to select an appropriate distance measure in an uncertain context. To replace the distance measure, we introduced an improved correlation coefficient measure in fermatean fuzzy contexts by considering the hesitancy function of fermatean fuzzy sets (FFS). First, we establish the proposed correlation coefficient by defining its main characteristics, including the weighted correlation coefficient, type I and type II closeness measures, and the weighted index coefficient. Then, the TOPSIS method is extended using the proposed correlation measure in a fermatean fuzzy environment. There is an algorithm that presents the proposed fermatean fuzzy TOPSIS (FF-TOPSIS) method. The proposed approach is used to determine the ranking order of the EVs. To assist the decision-maker, the sensitivity of the proposed technique is investigated by varying its parameters. Finally, the consistency of the proposed FF-TOPSIS is evaluated by comparing it to existing crisp as well as fuzzy MCDM methods.Findings: By implementing the FF-TOPSIS approach, it has been determined that the fifth EV model is the most favorable option, while the first model is deemed the least desirable choice. The primary factors to evaluate an EV are its range and its price, rather than battery life, storage, and charging time.Originality: This article presents a novel correlation coefficient for FFSs, which incorporates the hesitancy function into the calculation for the first time. The correlation-based FF-TOPSIS method is a novel extension of the TOPSIS technique in fermatean fuzzy systems.

AB Traffic flow prediction is increasingly vital for the administration of metropolitan areas. Many research on spatio-temporal networks have been explored but the impacts of both spatial and temporal flexibility, complex spatial correlation has not been considered simultaneously. We present the Spatio-Temporal 3D Multiscale Dilated Dense Network (ST-3DMDDN), a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) deep learning neural network for the road level and region level traffic flow prediction. It uses autocorrelation analysis' early fusion method for importance sampling, a 3D multiscale dilated convolutional network to capture nearby and remote correlations simultaneously, and a densely connected network for deeper feature extraction. Considering traffic flow's heterogeneity, a new block called the "Spatial and Channel Recalibrate"(SCR) is designed to accurately analyze the correlation contributions. The ST-3DMDDN model is evaluated using three real traffic flows, and the findings indicate that our approach surpasses the performance of the baseline approaches.

AB The short-term spatiotemporal load forecasting of power distribution networks has been extensively studied in light of high importance in distribution system control and consumption management. Load forecasting is dependent on temporal and spatial parameters e.g., temperature, rainfall, and land use. Additionally, load time series have spatial autocorrelation in cities. Deep learning has been recently demonstrated to be effective and efficient in time-series and load forecasting in power distribution networks. The present study proposes a new algorithm based on Spatial Auto Correlation and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (SAC-ConvLSTM) algorithm via spatiotemporal power load autocorrelation modeling and deep learning. Load time-series signals in a power distribution network are decomposed into sub-signals using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then, the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of sub-signals is calculated, alleviating prediction model complexity using spatial statistics. The areas with significant positive/negative/no significant autocorrelation in each time-series sub-signal are separately used as the input of the SAC-ConvLSTM algorithm. Finally, the sub-signals are reconstructed into the load signals. This algorithm models the spatial relationships in time-series at different time intervals for power consumption forecasting. The proposed methodology was found to outperform the support vector machine (SVM), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU), Planar Flow-Based Variational Auto-Encoder (PFVAE) and Federated Averaging (FedAVG) algorithms in short-term power load forecasting for short term forecasting of up to two weeks, based on the evaluation metrics of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), producing values of 11.08% and 7.02% respectively.

AB Under complex drilling working conditions, it is difficult to completely describe the working state of the drilling pump fluid end with a single-source signal to achieve a high fault diagnosis accuracy. This paper proposes to use dual-source signals (vibration signal and strain signal) to describe the working state of the fluid end. Especially, a dual-source gramian angular field (DS-GAF) method is proposed to fuse vibration-strain signals to provide more fault information. In DS-GAF method, the dual-source signal is converted to points in spherical coordinates, and the arccosine of the normalized amplitude of the two signals is assumed as the polar angle and the azimuthal angle, respectively. Three DS-GAF matrices are generated with the position of the points. These three matrices are respectively encoded as three colors (red, green, and blue) channels of the image to achieve signal fusion. A fault diagnosis method based on DS-GAF and ResNet for the drilling pump fluid end is proposed to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy under multiple working conditions. First, by the DS-GAF method, the vibration-strain signals of the fluid end are fused and converted into a fault diagnosis image dataset. Second, a fault diagnosis model based on ResNet is established and the effect of batch size on the performance of the fault diagnosis model is discussed. Finally, fault diagnosis experiments are carried out on the proposed fault diagnosis model and its performance is investigated. The results show that the diagnosis method proposed in this paper has the highest diagnostic accuracy of 98.97% for nine fault types under multiple operating conditions, with a maximum improvement of 18.91% compared to the original GAF method. The DS-GAF method for signal fusing proposed in this paper not only improves the accuracy of fluid end diagnosis, but also provides a reference for the signal fusion diagnosis of other equipment.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB The interaction between ramp and mainline vehicles plays a crucial role in merging areas, especially in the mixed-traffic environment. The driving behaviours of human drivers are uncertain and diverse, and the uncertainty makes it more complex for connected automated vehicles (CAV) to plan trajectories and merge into the mainline. To overcome this problem, a interactive merging strategy based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is designed, enabling the ramp vehicle (CAV) to consider the dynamic reaction of mainline vehicles. There are two agents in our interactive strategy, one of which is to predict and analyse the behaviour of mainline vehicles (human-driven vehicles, HDV, or non-connected vehicles). The other is created for exploring optimal merging actions of ramp vehicles. Firstly, game theory is used to model the competitive behaviours between ramp and mainline vehicles, and the Nash equilibrium of joint actions guides the ramp vehicle to learn best response to the mainline vehicle. Secondly, the Nash double Q algorithm is developed to ensure the outputs of Q networks are trained to efficiently converge to the Nash equilibrium point. The trained Q networks are then used for online control. Finally, our strategy is compared with single RL and existing MADRL algorithms in real on-ramp scenarios. Simulations show our strategy to be successful in coordinating both vehicles via analysis of human drivers, resulting in improved driving performance in terms of global safety, efficiency, and comfort.

AB Recent studies focus on the utilization of deep learning approaches to recognize depression from facial videos. However, these approaches have been hindered by their limited performance, which can be attributed to the inadequate consideration of global spatial-temporal relationships in significant local regions within faces. In this paper, we propose Spatial-Temporal Attention Depression Recognition Network (STA-DRN) for depression recognition to enhance feature extraction and increase the relevance of depression recognition by capturing the global and local spatial-temporal information. Our proposed approach includes a novel Spatial-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism, which generates spatial and temporal attention vectors to capture the global and local spatial-temporal relationships of features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate pixel-wise STA mechanisms for depression recognition based on 3D video analysis. Additionally, we propose an attention vector-wise fusion strategy in the STA module, which combines information from both spatial and temporal domains. We then design the STA-DRN by stacking STA modules ResNet-style. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 show that our method achieves competitive performance, with mean absolute error/root mean square error (MAE/RMSE) scores of 6.15/7.98 and 6.00/7.75, respectively. Moreover, visualization analysis demonstrates that the STA-DRN responds significantly in specific locations related to depression. The code is available at: https://github.com/divertingPan/STA-DRN.

AB Considering the influence of economies of scale and ship capacity on empty container repositioning, using foldable containers and container leasing may be effective ways to save the operating costs of liner shipping companies. Considering the minimization of the transportation costs of empty and laden containers, this paper studies a liner shipping hub location problem with empty container repositioning (LSHLPECR) considering foldable containers. We propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the formulation of the LSHLPECR. In terms of the optimal solution of our MILP, this paper further explores the container leasing pricing problem (CLPP), where our aim is to obtain perceived container leasing prices (PCLPs) utilizing the inverse optimization technique. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the studied problems.

TI KD-PAR: A knowledge distillation-based pedestrian attribute recognition
   model with multi-label mixed feature learning network
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Pedestrian attribute recognition; Mixed feature learning; Structural
   re-parameterization; Attribute weight; Knowledge distillation
AB In this paper, a novel knowledge distillation (KD)-based pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) model is developed, where a multi-label mixed feature learning network (MMFL-Net) is designed and adopted as the student model. In particular, by applying the grouped depth-wise separable convolution, re-parameterization and coordinate attention mechanism, not only the multi-scale receptive field information is sufficiently fused and spatially dependent robust features are extracted, the model complexity is also effectively kept acceptable. To alleviate the imbalance of category samples, an attribute weight parameter is proposed and considered when calculating the multi-label loss. Moreover, the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence-based KD scheme can facilitate the learning of MMFL-Net from the teacher model, which benefits strong fitting ability of the deep feature correlations so as to realize a highly generalized model. The proposed KD-PAR is comprehensively evaluated through many of experiments, and experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model as compared with other advanced MLL-based methods and state-of-the-art PAR models, which efficiently achieves the balance between accuracy and complexity. When facing the complex scenes such as blurry background, similar object interference, and target occlusion, the proposed KD-PAR can even present satisfactory recognition results with strong robustness, thereby providing a feasible and practical solution to the PAR tasks.

TI FedEL: Federated ensemble learning for non-iid data
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; Statistical heterogeneity; Ensemble learning
AB Federated learning (FL) is a joint training pattern that fully utilizes data information whereas protecting data privacy. A key challenge in FL is statistical heterogeneity, which arises on account of the heterogeneity of local data distributions among clients, leading to inconsistency in local optimization goals and ultimately reducing the performance of globally aggregated models. We propose the Federated Ensemble Learning (FedEL), which makes full use of the heterogeneity of data distribution among clients to train a group of weak learners with diversity to construct a global model, which is a novel solution to the non-independent identical distribution (non-IID) problem. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed FedEL can improve performance in non-IID data scenarios. Even under extreme statistical heterogeneity, the average accuracy of FedEL is 3.54% higher than the state-of-the-art FL method. Moreover, the proposed FedEL reduces model storage and reasoning costs compared with traditional ensemble learning. The proposed FedEL demonstrates good generalization ability in experiments across different datasets, including natural scene image datasets and medical image datasets.

AB This study develops a framework for multistage large-scale group decision-making problems. In the proposed framework, we develop an exit and entry mechanism for decision makers (DMs), which can select suitable DMs for subsequent decision-making stages, exclude unqualified DMs, and maintain good trust relationships among DMs. Second, the relationships between DMs are allowed to evolve by building new links and updating trust levels. Third, we propose a new method to generate a recommendation plan for each DM by referencing another DM's evaluation (reference source) in a specific proportion (modification rate). The probability of a DM accepting its recommendation plan can be calculated by considering two factors (reference source and modification rate). Then, we consider the expectation of incrementing group consensus degree as the objective function to determine the optimal reference source and modification rate for each DM, thereby generating its recommendation plan. Finally, simulation and comparison experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving the efficiency of consensus reaching among DMs.

AB The mainstream approach to addressing the issues of insufficient historical data and high annotation costs in the domain of rotating machinery is to build transfer learning models based on labeled multi-source data. However, the practical diagnosis of failure cases often relies on data privacy, thereby limiting the widespread application of current multi-source domain transfer approaches for the 'data silos' problem of. In view of the above problem, a multi-source weighted source-free domain transfer approach is designed for rotating machinery fault diagnosis, and the designed scheme can efficiently achieve data privacy and domain transfer. Specifically, the proposed approach achieves knowledge transfer from the source to the target during the training process of the unlabeled target data without accessing the source data. This is accomplished through the utilization of a designed reinforced information maximization strategy and improved self-training mechanism. Additionally, a weighted strategy is devised to automatically apply optimal values to all source domains based on their relevance to the target domain. The proposed framework demonstrates accuracy exceeding 96% across eight cross-domain diagnostic cases in two sets of rotating machinery data, with an average accuracy of 98.26%. These results underscore the exceptional ability of the proposed method to address cross-domain fault diagnosis in rotating machinery while ensuring privacy protection.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB With the advent of the post-pandemic era, the global economic situation has tightened, and the economic benefits of container ports have also been affected. This paper attempts to build a novel berth-tugboat-quay crane joint scheduling method for container ports to reduce the economic cost of container ports. Firstly, from the perspective of the economic cost of container ports, considering random economic factors, this paper proposes a new berth-tugboat-quay crane joint dispatch optimization model, namely E-BUQC, by taking the minimum time cost of vessels in port, the cost of additional freight distance for trucks, the cost of tugboat operation, and the minimum operation cost of quay cranes as the objective function. Then, in order to obtain a relatively high quality solution, based on chaotic mapping and quantum computing, this paper constructs a new chaotic quantum adaptive satin bower bird optimizer algorithm, namely CQASBO, formulates exclusive coding rules for the E-BUQC model, develops a feasible integer algorithm, and proposes a new joint scheduling solution method of berth-tugboat-quay crane, named E-BUQC_CQASBO. Subsequently, based on the simulation examples of two ports in northern China, the new solution method is tested. The simulation test results show that the E-BUQC model obtains an appropriate solution; The CQASBO constructed in this paper has better performance than other traditional comparison algorithms selected in this paper and can provide a better solution when solving the EBUQC model.

AB Imbalanced tabular datasets adversely impact the predictive performance of most supervised learning algorithms as the imbalanced distribution can lead to a bias preferring the majority class. To address this problem, we propose utilizing supervised contrastive representation learning in conjunction with the tree-structured parzen estimator technique for imbalanced tabular data. Drawing on the success of contrastive representation learning in computer vision, we extend its application to the tabular domain. Through the introduction of supervised contrastive learning, we address the limitation of data augmentation methods for tabular data by incorporating label information. This approach enables us to extract hidden information from the tabular data and obtain discriminative representations, which enhances the performance of supervised learning algorithms. Additionally, the hyper-parameter temperature.. of supervised contrastive learning has a decisive influence on the performance and is difficult to tune. We introduce tree-structured parzen estimator, a Bayesian optimization technique, to automatically select the best tau. We evaluate our approach on fifteen real-world public tabular datasets from diverse domains. The results reveal the superiority of tree-structured parzen estimator over other hyper-parameter optimization methods in effectively searching for the optimal value of tau. More importantly, the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches for imbalanced learning, achieving average improvements of 5.1%, 6.0%, 9.0%, and 8.7% across four main evaluation metrics, which validates that the proposed method is well-suited for addressing imbalanced problems in real-world applications.

AB During the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) processing, the individuals often hold different opinions about the alternatives. It is necessary to aggregate the different individual opinions into a unified group opinion. In the real world, experts sometimes use linguistic expressions to evaluate attributes in uncertain environments. To address the problem of reducing the information loss of expert opinion aggregation in MAGDM, this paper proposes a MAGDM approach based on linguistic concept lattices in the context of uncertain linguistic expression. A linguistic concept lattice for multi-expert linguistic formal context is first constructed based on linguistic truth-valued lattice implication algebra, which can express both comparable and incomparable linguistic information in the decision-making process. Different expert opinions are aggregated via the extent of fuzzy linguistic concepts, which can reduce information loss in the aggregation process. Second, meet-irreducible elements in the linguistic concept lattice are introduced to reduce the computational complexity of obtaining all fuzzy linguistic concepts in the decision-making process. the distance between the intents of different fuzzy linguistic concepts is considered to enhance the rationality of linguistic decision results. In addition, the expert's decision-making process for each alternative is visualized via linguistic concept lattices. Finally, the case study and comparative analysis illustrate the validity and rationality of the proposed approach in MAGDM with linguistic information.

AB With the increasing consumption of global water resources, research on sustainable water resource utilization has become a topic of urgent interest. Despite the promulgation of policies and laws on the protection of water resources, the sustainable utilization and development of water resources in China are still far from reaching their initially established targets. This is partly explained by real-life conflicts that arise, in which different decision makers (DMs) possess different levels of professional knowledge, social status, and even power in contexts where the parties' ability to leverage information varies greatly. Sustainable water resource utilization conflicts between the government and factories exemplify the impact of this information asymmetry on the relationship between DMs for the purposes of conflict resolution. In this paper, it is assumed that if one DM in a conflict has more information, their information advantage will affect the policy formation of the other DM. Thus, to analyze and resolve relevant problems, the concept of information asymmetry between two DMs is integrated into the basic structure of the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). According to the mathematical expression of the information asymmetry preferences of DMs, a set of information asymmetry stability definitions can be introduced to determine the stable state for each DM. The sustainable water resource utilization conflict in Niangziguan Springs Basin is used as an exemplar to confirm the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method. Stability analysis shows that when the government implements strict environmental policies by leveraging more information, factories should adjust their preference relations to follow the rules and regulations to protect water resource in practice. Finally, comprehensive sustainable utilization and development of natural resource mechanisms must be implemented not only for these factories but also for other industries in China.

TI RCNet: Related Context-Driven Network with Hierarchical Attention for

ID MODEL
AB Recent progress in salient object detection (SOD) mainly depends on dilated convolution with different receptive fields to capture contextual information for multi-scale learning. Intuitively, contextual information in different scales is conducive to understanding the image content, and thus can help us identify and locate salient objects in real-world scenes. However, the sparsity inside the dilated convolution kernel may cause the problem of local information loss, limiting the predictive accuracy of the model. In addition, the inequality of feature channels should also be considered, and they often feature different deviations for salient objects or background noises. Although some channel attention mechanisms have been proposed in SOD, their ability to capture global information is limited, and the problem of high complexity is still a great challenge. To alleviate the abovementioned problems, we propose a Related Context-Driven Network (RCNet) with Hierarchical Attention for Salient Object Detection, consisting of a cascaded multi-scale context exploration (CMCE) module and a hierarchical feature aggregation (HFA) module. The CMCE module is to capture multi-scale contextual information through using multi-receptive-field dilated convolutions in a diamond hierarchical structure, where a feature reconstruction operation is deployed to improve the correlation of features, effectively avoiding the gridding problems and local information loss. Meanwhile, the HFA module adaptively interacts with the complementary information of the multi-level features to further capture the important information from within the feature channel by a multi-source hybrid channel attention (MHCA) mechanism to generate powerful and robust feature representations. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RCNet method consistently outperforms 20 existing the state-of-the-art SOD methods in terms of accuracy, generalization capacity and robustness.

AB In view of the lack of research on two-sided matching group decision-making and the rare application of Fermatean fuzzy numbers in two-sided matching decision-making, a multi-attribute personnel-position matching group decision-making methodology is proposed. First, the group decision-making problem for multi-attribute personnel-position matching is described. To address this problem, a new algorithm is designed to determine the attribute weights. The group comprehensive Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrix can be obtained by aggregating the attribute weights, the Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrices given by the decision-makers and the weights of decision-makers. Moreover, another novel algorithm is designed to calculate the weight of the group consistency attribute. The synthetic Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrix is obtained by aggregating the group consistency attribute weights and the Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrices given by the candidates. Moreover, based on the group comprehensive Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrix and the synthetic Fermatean fuzzy evaluation matrix, a multi-objective two-sided matching model is established to maximize the satisfaction of twosided agents. The optimal two-sided matching scheme is obtained by the model solution. Finally, the feasibility, effectiveness and innovation of the proposed methodology are verified by an example analysis of personnelposition matching. The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows: (1) Group decision-making of two-sided matching based on Fermatean fuzzy information is explored. (2) A Fermatean fuzzy induced ordered weighted average (FFIOWA) operator that aggregates Fermatean fuzzy numbers is introduced. (3) Two new algorithms for calculating the unknown attribute weights are designed. (4) A satisfaction calculation method considering the accuracy coefficient is proposed. (5) The model for Fermatean fuzzy multi-attribute personnelposition matching group decision-making is developed.

AB Over the last decade, with the increasing popularity and usage of the internet of things worldwide, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a key technology of the modern era. IoMT uses Artificial Intelligence, 5G, big data, edge computing, and blockchain to provide users with electronic medical services. However, it may face several security threats and attacks over an insecure public network. Therefore, to protect sensitive medical data in IoMT, it is necessary to design a secure and efficient authentication protocol. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication management protocol based on blockchain. The protocol uses a blockchain to store identities and related parameters to assist communication entities in authentication. In addition, the protocol adopts a three-factor authentication method and introduces Chebyshev chaotic map to ensure the security of user login and authentication. Formal security proof and analysis using the random oracle model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic show that the proposed protocol is secure. Moreover, we use informal security analysis to demonstrate that the protocol can resist various security attacks. The functional comparison shows that the protocol has high security. Through performance analysis and comparison with other protocols, the proposed protocol can increase computation overhead, communication overhead, and storage overhead by up to 39.8%, 93.6%, and 86.7%,respectively.

AB In recent studies, Transformer collaborated with convolution neural network (CNN) have made certain progress in the field of intelligent fault diagnosis by leveraging their respective advantages of global and local feature extraction. However, the multihead self-attention block used by Transformer and cross-channel convolution mechanism existing in CNN would make the collaborative models overly complex, leading to higher hardware requirements and limited industrial application scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight fault diagnosis framework called LiConvFormer to address the aforementioned challenges. First, a separable multi scale convolution block is designed to extract multilocal receptive field features of vibration signals and greatly reduce the learning parameters and computations. Second, a broadcast self-attention block is developed to capture critical fine-grained features within the signal's global scope, while avoiding cumbersome operations such as matrix multiplication and multidimensional exponentiation. Experimental results on three mechanical systems show that the proposed framework can accommodate advantages of lightweight and robustness compared to the recent Transformer and CNN-based fault diagnosis methods; moreover, the superiority of the above two blocks is also verified. The code library is available at: https://github.com/yanshen0210/LiC onvFormer-a-lightweight-fault-diagnosis-framework.

AB Order cancellation, due to such as customer plan adjustments or market changes, usually occurs in the real production environment of distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP). However, thus far, all exiting researches about DFJSP have not consider order cancellation, which normally leads to resource waste and makes the original scheme infeasible. Hence, in this work, we propose a DFJSP considering order cancellation (DFJSPC) for the first time; and design a reformative memetic algorithm (RMA) to solve the DFJSPC aiming at optimizing the makespan and total energy consumption. In the RMA, a five-layer encoding operator and a new load balancing initialization method are designed to improve the quality of the initial population. Some effective crossover, mutation and local search operators are designed, which can fully expand the solution space of the algorithm and improve its convergence speed. A total of 60 DFJSPC benchmark instances are constructed, and some comparative experiments are carried out among the proposed RMA and three well-known algorithms, namely NNIA, NSGA-II and NSGA-III. The final experimental results verified the outstanding performance of the RMA. This research will provide a theoretical basis for the order cancellation problem in distributed production settings, and help manufacturers to properly handle canceled orders to reduce resource waste and reschedule the infeasible schemes causing from order cancellation.

AB Wind energy increasingly attracts investment from many countries as a clean and renewable energy source. Since wind energy investment cost is high, the efficiency of a potential wind power plant should be determined using wind power prediction models and wind speed data before installation. Accurate wind power estimation is crucial to set up comprehensive strategies for wind power generation. This study estimated the power produced in a wind turbine using six different regression algorithms based on machine learning using temperature, humidity, pressure, air density, and wind speed data. The proposed estimation model was evaluated on the data received between 2011 and 2020 at station 17,112 in canakkale, Turkey. XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and M5-Prime algorithms were used to create predictive models. Furthermore, model explanations were presented using the SHAP methodology. Among the regression algorithms evaluated according to the R2 performance metric, the best performance was obtained from the XGBoost algorithm. Regarding computational speed, the LightGBM model emerged as the most efficient model. The wind speed was shown to be the input feature with the SHAP algorithm's most significant impact on the model predictions.

TI YOLO-FA: Type-1 fuzzy attention based YOLO detector for vehicle
   detection
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Vehicle detection; YOLO; Fuzzy attention; MDFormer
AB Vehicle detection is an important component of intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving. However, in real-world vehicle detection scenarios, the presence of many complex and high uncertainty factors, such as illumination differences, motion blur, occlusion, weather, etc., makes accurate and real-time vehicle detection still challenging. In order to reduce the influence of these uncertainties in real scenarios and improve the accuracy and real-time performance of vehicle detection, this paper proposes a type-1 fuzzy attention (T1FA), in which fuzzy entropy is introduced to re-weight the feature map in order to reduce the uncertainty of the feature map and facilitates the detector's focus on the target center as a way to effectively improve the accuracy of vehicle detection. Furthermore, to detect vehicles with different sizes more effectively, mixed depth convolution in MetaFormer (MDFormer) is employed as a token mixer to capture multi-scale perceptual fields. And a novel YOLO detector based on fuzzy attention (YOLO-FA) is proposed. Experimental results show that T1FA can boost 3.2% AP50 on challenging vehicle detection dataset UA-DETRAC, which is better than other commonly used attention mechanisms, especially in scenarios of rain and nighttime with higher uncertainty by 4.2% and 8.1% AP50, respectively. Finally, without pretraining on extra data, YOLO-FA achieves 70.0% AP50 and 50.3% AP on UA-DETRAC, which achieves better balance between accuracy and speed compared with state-of-the-art detectors. The remarkable improvement of T1FA in different detectors and datasets also shows the considerable generalization of T1FA.

AB This paper provides the first extensive comparison of NARX and NARMAX models for multi-step prediction. NARMAX models are more complex and require more sophisticated training procedures than NARX models, as described in this paper. However, for some types of data, the NARMAX models provide significantly improved forecasts for shorter prediction horizons, although the predictions converge as the horizon increases. This paper analyzes the NARX and NARMAX predictors in depth on simulated and experimental data to determine those situations where the NARMAX predictor is preferred.

AB Bull Trench Kiln-based Brick industries are major contributors of Particulate Matter Pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10), which leads to deterioration of air quality, and hence needs to be monitored. As the static air monitoring stations require huge infrastructure and are sparsely located, it is necessary to find alternate ways using recent technologies like IoT, Machine Learning, and Serverless Computing. IoT devices being low cost and portable could be deployed near brick industries, however, they are sensitive to fluctuating ambient air temperature or humidity and hence have to be calibrated and there is a need for powerful back-end infrastructures for storage and analyses of data. The existing approach of transmitting IoT-based data to the cloud is time-consuming, energy inefficient, prone to scaling problems, has poor resource utilization, and is expensive. In this study, the IoT data are calibrated using ML Classifier algorithms and an Automatic Function Triggerer -Function-as-a-Service (AFT-FaaS) method is proposed, which is based on event-driven, Serverless method using AWS Lambda along with the Three-Tier Serverless architecture (Edge Tier, Fog Tire, and Cloud Tier) to deal with the challenges of delay, under-resource allocation, and to reduce the expenditures. The data transmitted to the cloud using the proposed AFT-FaaS method are indexed in ElasticSearch and Kibana is used for the analysis and visualization of data. While performing calibration, Random Forest Classifier was chosen as it had accuracy of above 98%. Finally, an in-depth pricing analysis is performed to better understand the difference between different configurations deployed for Serverless and non-Serverless Computing methods, which shows there is a significant reduction (7 times) of expenses incurred while using Serverless Computing than the non-Serverless Computing methods.

AB Graph neural network (GNN) is considered as the state-of-art method for KG-based recommendation. However, the existing GNN-based recommendation methods incorporating KG information fail to fully consider interacyions between nodes in the process of message passing and aggregating, which will affect the performance improvement of recommendation. To resolve the above limitation, we propose a Feature Interactive Graph Neural Network for KG-based Recommendation (FIKGRec) to explicitly model sophisticated feature interactions from the complex structure of heterogeneous knowledge graph. The overall framework consists of three components: (1) For items, we construct item-KGs where the nodes (entities) denote items and items' features, and edges represent the relations between entities. Modeling feature interaction can be thus transformed into modeling node (entity) interaction on the knowledge graph. Specifically, we integrate the collaborative signals into the process of KG signals propagation to capture more precise user preferences and then employ the feature entity interaction layer to incorporate the interaction information between entities in the process of neighbor aggregation of entities in item-KG. (2) For users, a preference-aware attention mechanism is designed to obtain the user's fine-grained preference for items that have been interacted. (3) The final representations of users and items are fed to deep neural network (DNN) to model complex correlations between them. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the better performance of our FIKGRec framework compared to state-of-the-arts methods.

ID COORDINATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK
AB In this study, a novel government-backed agri-food supply chain model (GBASM) is introduced among farmers and agricultural enterprises in their respective market. In the GBASM, the government provides subsidies to each member of the supply chain to encourage them to collaborate on a common economic platform. A game-theoretic perspective is established among farmers and agricultural enterprises to determine whether or not they should participate in this new model for their economic benefits. In this regard, a Nash game is proposed in which the Nash equilibrium is derived as the mixed equilibrium strategy, assuming that farmers and agricultural enterprises are two rational actors cooperating over market price in the GBASM. In numerical experiments, two sample models are examined based on the parameter values of each participant, and the grey wolf optimizer algorithm is utilized to derive mixed decision-making strategies from a variety of scenarios considered for each sample model. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the impact of the GBASM on the decision-making processes of farmers and agricultural enterprises. The integration of the GBASM into a case study of the tomato supply chain in Buenos Aires, Argentina, confirms the robustness of the model and creates economically feasible and consistent pricing structures within the local area.

AB Multi-focus image fusion techniques are designed to integrate the focused regions of multiple source images to produce an all-in-focus image. Unfortunately, the fusion results generated by existing methods are prone to suffer from chromatic aberrations and blurred boundary regions. In this paper, a multi-focus image fusion framework combining focus property detection and deep image matting is proposed to achieve high -quality fusion results. Specifically, we introduce spatial frequency detection blocks, which integrate the spatial frequency information of source images at different levels to achieve effective focus property detection for the initial decision. Then, the trimap acquired from the initial decision is optimized using a deep matting model so as to further detect the focused/defocused boundaries and obtain a more precise decision map. Meanwhile, a new hybrid loss function is introduced, and a large-scale dataset is created to improve the performance of the fusion framework. Finally, the fusion result is obtained by integrating the focused regions via the decision map. Compared to 18 other advanced fusion methods, the proposed method outperforms all of them in terms of the seven objective metrics evaluated on two publicly available datasets. These experimental results provide strong evidence that the proposed fusion framework excels not only in subjective vision but also in quantitative analysis. The code of the proposed method will be available at https://github.com/govenda/DIMF.

AB With all the advancements in the last decade in Intelligent Transportation systems (ITS), there has been an exponential increase in the number of applications provided to the Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). These applications provide unmatched security and safety services. As a result, there is a huge surge in the amount of data being generated and transmitted within the VANETs. In this paper, we have proposed a dual blockchain based decentralized architecture for authentication of the vehicles and secure & efficient communication within the network. The use of individual blockchains for authentication and message sharing makes the network more efficient and fast while also helping to increase the network security. Both the blockchains use a different consensus algorithm which adds another layer of security. The security and performance evaluation of the proposed architecture proves that it is resistant to a number of security attacks and has a lower computational cost, higher throughput, lower transmission delay and higher vehicle verification rate by a significant amount when compared to existing schemes.

AB Texture representation is a challenging problem due to the complex underlying physics of texture as well as the variations caused by changes in viewpoint. Recent progress in texture analysis has been made by the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in feature learning. However, most current methods aggregate the features from the last convolutional layer of the CNN to obtain a global feature vector, which fails to leverage shallow low-level visual cues and cross-layer feature patterns, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose to trace the features generated along the convolutional layers via a histogram of local 3D invariant binary patterns, called deep tracing patterns. This leads to a highly discriminative yet robust global feature representation module. Building such a module into a CNN backbone, we develop an effective approach for texture recognition. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach provides a discriminative and robust texture descriptor, with state-of-the-art performance achieved.

AB Selecting outstanding technology stocks for investment is challenging. Specifically, the research of the investment for academic purposes is not mature enough due to the disarray of the publications and the overwhelming informative experience from profit-making websites. Often, some authors entitle the stock price prediction as a stock selection problem; both prediction and selection are just sub-sections of portfolio management. Moreover, stock websites provide numerous potential criteria showing various evaluations to simulate and monitor the stock market professionally, which increases the difficulty of academic studies on stock selection.The paper generalizes a novel framework with a user-interactive interface for stock selection problems based on multi-source data fusion and decision-level fusion to enhance reliability limited by the narrow criteria performance and the strength of a model overcoming the weakness of a single-performed model. This framework benefits the time-series prediction and decision-making study. Besides, we propose adopting dynamic time warping to assist a task-learning process by customizing a loss function that improves the accuracy of data prediction. The experiment shows that the proposed method reduces the prediction log error by 6.3% on average and decreases the warping cost by 5.6% on average over all cases of real-situation data. Finally, we illustrate the proposed framework by implementing it in a real-world stock data selection. The results are practical and effective, further justified through a detailed ablation study.

AB As a main branch of weakly supervised learning paradigm, partial label learning (PLL) copes with the situation where each sample corresponds to ambiguous candidate labels containing the unknown true label. The primary difficulty of PLL lies in label ambiguities, most existing researches focus on individual instance knowledge while ignore the importance of cross-sample knowledge. To circumvent this difficulty, an innovative multi-task framework is proposed in this work to integrate self-supervision and self-distillation to tackle PLL problem. Specifically, in the self-distillation task, cross-sample knowledge in the same batch is utilized to refine ensembled soft targets to supervise the distillation operation without using multiple networks. The auxiliary self-supervised task of recognizing rotation transformations of images provides more supervisory signal for feature learning. Overall, training supervision is constructed not only from the input data itself but also from other instances within the same batch. Empirical results on benchmark datasets reveal that this method is effective in learning from partially labeled data.

AB Multimodal medical data fusion has emerged as a transformative approach in smart healthcare, enabling a comprehensive understanding of patient health and personalized treatment plans. In this paper, a journey from data to information to knowledge to wisdom (DIKW) is explored through multimodal fusion for smart healthcare. We present a comprehensive review of multimodal medical data fusion focused on the integration of various data modalities. The review explores different approaches such as feature selection, rule-based systems, machine ;earning, deep learning, and natural language processing, for fusing and analyzing multimodal data. This paper also highlights the challenges associated with multimodal fusion in healthcare. By synthesizing the reviewed frameworks and theories, it proposes a generic framework for multimodal medical data fusion that aligns with the DIKW model. Moreover, it discusses future directions related to the four pillars of healthcare: Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory approaches. The components of the comprehensive survey presented in this paper form the foundation for more successful implementation of multimodal fusion in smart healthcare. Our findings can guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging the power of multimodal fusion with the state-of-the-art approaches to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes.

   image segmentation
AB Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been a popular technique to resolve the annotation scarcity problem in pattern recognition and medical image segmentation, which usually focuses on two critical issues: 1) learning a well-structured categorizable embedding space, and 2) establishing a robust mapping from the embedding space to the pixel space. In this paper, to resolve the first issue, we propose a hard positives oriented contrastive (HPC) learning strategy to pre-train an encoder-decoder-based segmentation model. Different from vanilla contrastive learning tending to focus only on hard negatives, our HPC learning strategy additionally concentrates on hard positives (i.e., samples with the same category but dissimilar feature representations to the anchor), which are considered to play an even more crucial role in delivering discriminative knowledge for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, the HPC is constructed from two levels, including an unsupervised image-level HPC (IHPC) and a supervised pixel-level HPC (PHPC), empowering the embedding space learned by the encoder with both local and global senses. Particularly, the PHPC learning strategy is implemented in a region-based manner, saving memory usage while delivering more multi-granularity information. In response to the second issue, we insert several feature swap (FS) modules into the pre-trained decoder. These FS modules aim to perturb the mapping from the intermediate embedding space towards the pixel space, trying to encourage more robust segmentation predictions. Experiments on two public clinical datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

DE Cross-lingual summarization; Fact-relationship graph; Deliberation
   network; Graph generation; Factual inconsistency
AB The aim of cross-lingual summarization (CLS) is to condense the content of a document in one language into a summary in another language. In essence, a CLS model requires both translation and summarization capabilities, which presents a unique challenge, as the model must effectively tackle the difficulties associated with both tasks simultaneously (e.g., semantic alignment, information compression and factual inconsistency). Graph-based semantic representation can model important text information in a structured manner, which may alleviate these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Cross-Lingual Summarization method based on cross-lingual Fact-relationship Graph Generation (FGGCLS). Specifically, we first construct fact-relationship graphs for source language documents and target language summaries. Then, we introduce a cross-lingual fact-relationship graph generation method, which converts the CLS problem into a cross-lingual fact-relationship graph generation problem. This approach simplifies semantic alignment and information compression through the generation of graphs and leads to improved fact consistency. Finally, the generated fact-relationship graph of the target language summary serves as a draft for generating the summary, which enhances the quality of the generated summary. We conduct systematic experiments on the Zh2EnSum and En2ZhSum datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the performance of CLS and alleviate factual inconsistency.

AB Multimodal image matching suffers from severe geometric and nonlinear intensity distortion (NID). Towards this problem, we propose a multimodal image matching algorithm based on multi-orientation filtering results, called position-orientation-scale guided geometric and intensity-invariant feature transformation (POS-GIFT). First, we design a multi-layer circular point sampling pattern to effectively capture the local image structure. Then, we propose a novel feature descriptor that can work robustly across rotational differences in [0 degrees, 360 degrees) in the presence of NID. Specifically, we (1) integrate the multi-orientation filtering response in the local neighborhood with a Gaussian weight to form the feature of each sampled point (GFP), (2) build feature vectors for each orientation by concatenating the features of points grouped by orientation, (3) estimate the primary orientation by finding the feature vector with the largest norm which is constructed in the previous step, (4) modify the order of elements of GFP, and (5) finally concatenate the features of all sampled points in a certain order to form the complete feature descriptor. At last, we propose a position-orientation-scale guided inlier recovery strategy (POS) by integrating the global position, orientation, and scale information to further improve the matching performance, especially the number and distribution of correct matches in texture-less and complex areas. Experimental results on various multimodal datasets from remote sensing, medical, and computer vision imaging domains show that POS-GIFT outperforms eight state-of-the-art multimodal image feature matching algorithms which are five handcrafted-based methods, OS-SIFT, PSO-SIFT, LGHD, RIFT, and LNIFT, and three learning based methods RedFeat, MatchFormer, and SemLA by several times in terms of correct matches while improving the root-mean-square error to around 1 pixel. Our implementation is available at https://github. com/Zhuolu-Hou/POS-GIFT.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Trajectory prediction aims to estimate the future location of the vehicle based on its historical motion state, which is essential for driving decision-making and local motion planning of smart vehicles. However, affected by the multiple complex interaction in the traffic scene, predicting future trajectory accurately is a challenging task. The majority of existing methods only focus on modeling the inter-vehicle interaction, while ignoring the influence of road alignment and driver's lane-change intention, making the poor performance of models, especially for long-term prediction or when the vehicle maneuvers laterally. To overcome the deficiencies, this paper proposes Intention-convolution and Hybrid-Attention Network (IH-Net) for reliable trajectory prediction. Specifically, we analyze the correlation of lane-change behavior and the motion state of the vehicle, and then the Intention-convolutional Social Pooling module (I-CS) is introduced to extract complete interaction including the driver's lane-change intention and inter-vehicle interaction. In addition, we construct a novel Hybrid Attention Mechanism (H-AM) to explore the trajectory periodicity formed under the restriction of road alignment, as well as the impacts of different features on trajectory prediction, which is used to improve the model's long-term prediction capacity. The model's prediction accuracy with RMSE loss function is tested on two public datasets NGSIM and highD, and the results demonstrate that IH-Net remarkably outperforms the state-of-art methods in long-term prediction.

ID SELECTION
AB Current artificial intelligence (AI) applications for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often lack a biological foundation in the decision-making process. In this study, we have employed AI for COVID-19 diagnosis using mass spectrometry (MS) data and leveraged explainable AI (X-AI) to explain the decision -making process on a local (per-sample) and global (all samples) basis. We first assessed eight machine learning models with five feature engineering techniques using a five-fold stratified cross-validation. The best accuracy was achieved by Random Forest (RF) classifier using the ratio of areas under the curve (AUC) from the MS data as features. These features were chosen on the basis of tentatively representing both human and viral proteins in human gargle samples. We evaluated the RF classifier on a 70% - 30% train-test split strategy of 152 human gargle samples, yielding an accuracy of 94.12% on the test dataset. Employing X-AI, we further interpreted the RF model using shapely additive explanations (SHAP) and feature importance techniques, including permutation and impurity-based feature importances. With these interpretation models offering a local and global explanation for the machine learning model decisions, we devised a straightforward, three -stage X-AI framework that can enable medical practitioners to understand the mechanisms of a black-box AI model. To the medical practitioner, this instills trust in the AI model by providing the rationales for its decisions.

AB Although graph-inspired clustering methods have achieved impressive success in the area of multi-view data analysis, current methods still face several challenges. First, classical graph construction approaches are computationally expensive in terms of both time and space for large-scale data. Second, fusing graphs from different views remains a challenge. Third, most existing methods require additional post-processing steps to generate the label assignment matrix. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi -view clustering algorithm, called latent information-guided one-step multi-view fuzzy clustering based on cross-view anchor graph. Specifically, we introduce an efficient cross-view anchor graph learning approach to construct the similarity matrix of multi-view data and extract latent information from the graph, which reduces the computational complexity of graph learning and inspires the optimization of the consensus membership matrix. Following that, our one-step multi-view fuzzy clustering algorithm can directly generate the final clustering result in an effective and straightforward manner. Furthermore, during the optimization process, the proposed method balances consensus matrix learning and view-specified membership exploration via a self-tuned weighting mechanism. The comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Drone technology, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has advanced rapidly in the last decade owing to the huge number of users. This approach has an immense opportunity in areas like healthcare, agriculture, and forestry. However, the transmission of digital images via drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and risks, due to a lack of efficient security solutions. Digital Image Watermarking (DIW) has emerged as a viable solution for digital image transmission in UAV applications. However, achieving robustness, security, and imperceptibility in a watermarking system at the same time is a difficult task. To address the aforementioned concerns, this paper proposes a secure digital image watermarking scheme in the hybrid DWT-SVD domain. The scaling factor is chosen adaptively from the hybrid Harmony-Grey Wolf (H-Grey) optimization algorithm to maintain a balance between imperceptibility and robustness. In addition, a novel symmetric cryptographic-based four-level encryption approach PSMD (Partitioning, Substituting, Merging, Division) is proposed to address UAV image security concerns by using Fibonacci and prime number series to generate two random keys. The proposed encryption scheme provides high security at low computational cost. The experimental results show that the visual quality and robustness are both high (Avg. PSNR = 41.27 dB and Avg. SSIM = 0.99, NC = 0.99, and BER = 0.0008 calculated for 100 images). The subjective and objective experimental analysis indicates that the proposed encryption scheme is highly secure and the computational cost is also low. The average embedding and extraction time is 0.25 s and 0.09 s It is resistant to various image processing attacks. A comparison with some of the most recent popular schemes confirms the scheme's effectiveness. The presented DIW can be used for copyright protection, UAV image transmission applications, military applications, and other purposes.

AB Depression is now a prevalent mental illness and multimodal data-based depression detection is an essential topic of research. Internet of Medical Things devices can provide data resources such as text, audio, and vision, which is valuable for depression detection. Moreover, previous studies have concentrated on using single characteristics of each modality, such as low-dimensional pre-designed features and high-level deep representation, which cannot completely capture the emotional information included in the data. Against this background, we design an intra-modal and inter-modal fusion framework called IIFDD for Corpus-based depression detection. Intra-modal fusion module is designed to integrate low-dimensional pre-designed features and high-dimension deep representation from the same modality for better learning of the semantics information. Then, the inter-modal fusion module is proposed to fuse features from different modalities with attention mechanisms and use the fused result to complete the depression classification. Experiments on two Chinese depression corpus datasets with acoustics, textual, and visual features show that IIFDD can achieve state-of-the-art performance for depression detection.

ID ATTENTION
AB Question model has been widely concerned as the cornerstone of constructing Visual Question Answering (VQA) models. Existing question models attempt to exploit word context to extract multi-level concepts for modeling multi-level questions. However, they still have many defects. For example, most question models utilize simple fusion methods to fuse shallow modules and extract parameter-unshared low-level concepts, leading to poor modeling of multi-level questions; although some question models use deep bidirectional Transformer encoder in external knowledge transfer and BERT for multi-level questions, their complexity is still high. To solve these issues, we propose a novel low-complex multi-level contextual question model, termed Context-aware Multi-level Question Embedding Fusion (CMQEF). We formalize its concepts and theories, deduce its modeling process, optimization process and feature extraction process, analyze its low complexity and high expressiveness, and prove that it defines a new way to solve parameter non-sharing for extracting parameter -shared multi-level concepts and optimize the tradeoff between expressiveness and complexity in question models. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VQA-CPv2 validate that comparing with the state-of-the-art, our CMQEF outperforms it on SANs and UpDn, reduces the language priors of SANs and UpDn, and has preferable interpretability and applicability. Our code is available at https://github.com/lsdruc/CMQEF-for-VQA.

AB Thrust is a crucial parameter to ensure the quality of underwater curved pipe jacking construction. A prediction framework based on hybrid deep learning is proposed to realize real-time prediction of thrust. The method contains graph convolutional neural network (GCN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and self-attention (SA) mechanism. To enhance the interpretability of the method, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and causal discovery models are introduced within the framework. Taking the salvage project of the "Yangtze Estuary No. 2 '' shipwreck as a case study, the prediction performance of the model is verified. The results show that the pro-posed model achieves excellent performance in thrust prediction for underwater curved pipe jacking, with an average MAE of 11.07 kN, RMSE of 13.96 kN, and R2 value of 0.934. The SHAP analysis reveals that angle, buried depth, and stratum changes exert significant influences on thrust. Furthermore, the spatial correlation and temporal correlation among features are revealed. Compared to other models, the proposed model exhibits su-perior prediction accuracy and is capable of handling various time step sizes, thereby providing valuable decision support for curved pipe jacking thrust prediction.

AB In group decision-making, the expressed opinion of a social individual may be inconsistent with or even opposite to his/her own private opinion or inner thought. Expressed and private opinions (EPOs) models were then developed to study decision-making mechanisms with private opinions. However, most of the existing EPOs models assumed that the individual private opinion is often fixed, or updated by his/her own private opinion and neighbors' expressed opinions, ignoring the behavior characteristics of social individuals. In this paper, a novel EPOs model is built under a more realistic scenario where the individual private opinions are updated by reasoning the neighbors' private opinions from their behaviors while the expressed opinions are subject to social pressure. Meanwhile, we investigate the group opinion formation under the proposed EPOs model over a Leader-Influencer-Follower hierarchical network. The evolution process under the proposed EPOs model shows that, on the one hand, when the social pressure is monotonically increasing, group expressed opinions often reach consensus, and the consensus reaching time is closely related to the pressure increase rate. On the other hand, group private opinions and behaviors of the individuals show polarization. The simulation results reveal the sociological phenomena of "the golden mean"and "inconsistent words and deeds", respectively.

AB Recent advances in intelligent wearable devices have brought tremendous chances for the development of healthcare monitoring system. However, the data collected by various sensors in it are user-privacy-related information. Once the individuals' privacy is subjected to attacks, it can potentially cause serious hazards. For this reason, a feasible solution built upon the compression-encryption architecture is proposed. In this scheme, we design an Adaptive Sparse Basis Compressive Sensing (ASB-CS) model by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) manipulation, while performing a rigorous proof of its effectiveness. Additionally, incorporating the Parametric Deformed Exponential Rectified Linear Unit (PDE-ReLU) memristor, a new fractional-order Hopfield neural network model is introduced as a pseudo-random number generator for the proposed cryptosystem, which has demonstrated superior properties in many aspects, such as hyperchaotic dynamics and multistability. To be specific, a plain medical image is subjected to the ASB-CS model and bidirectional diffusion manipulation under the guidance of the key-controlled cipher flows to yield the corresponding cipher image without visual semantic features. Ultimately, the simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of withstanding multiple security attacks and possesses balanced performance in terms of compressibility and robustness.

AB Online food delivery businesses have grown rapidly during the past few years. To attract customers, food delivery service providers are forming partnerships with as many restaurants as possible. For restaurant entrepreneurs, the selection of the best service provider is a critical decision that influences their sales. However, many qualitative criteria make this problem difficult. Although rating scales can convert subjective judgments into quantitative analysis, linguistic scales may make a comparison of alternatives' performances vague and unstandardised, especially for group decision making. The prioritisation of the criteria importance is also questionable, and reaching a consensus among decision makers might be difficult. To address such complications, this study proposes the use of fuzzy logic in determining the importance weights of the criteria in the direct rating approach, based on the perspectives of 60 restaurant operators in Thailand. The fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) is then used to rank alternatives, as demonstrated by a case of three food delivery providers in Thailand. Fuzzy simple additive weighting (fuzzy SAW), two rank-based weighting methods (rank sum and rank-order centroid), and two objective weighting methods (entropy and mean) are used to compare results. The results show that user-friendly apps, tracking systems, payment options, marketing campaigns, and service areas are among the important criteria that delivery service providers should address and improve in order to attract more restaurants and customers. Guidelines for restaurant operators to choose the appropriate weighting methodology and to rationally assess and compare the service providers' performances are provided.

AB Organizations have widely begun to adopt remote working since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect of remote work on team performance remains unknown. A multi-layer interaction system based on organizational systems theory was designed to assess how remote working affects team performance. Individual performance was computed using a positively skewed stochastic performance model and a modified NK model was used to simulate the team performance under specialized and collaborative conditions. The results showed a complex relationship between task complexity and remote rate and that collaborative teams require a higher remote rate when the probability of employees benefiting from remote work is low to avoid potential detriments from excessive competition. Further results considering agent heterogeneity suggest that individual-level gains are magnified or reduced at the team level and that assessing individual heterogeneity and task complexity is sig-nificant for designing remote strategies. In addition, differential mechanisms in team structure and the hierarchy of authority are discussed. This study presents the design and application of a novel business system that helps teams make optimal remote decisions in addition to responding to conflicting discussions in the literature and in practice and providing new insights into decision-making systems in a digital context.

AB Multi-label learning has attracted a great deal of research interests as it has a wide range of real-world applications. Although many multilabel learning methods have been proposed, very few of them have addressed the problem of class imbalance distribution in multilabel data. Moreover, most of the existing class imbalance multilabel learning algorithms only focus on solving the class imbalance problem, without taking into account the correlations among labels. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose to combine the well-known ensemble of classifier chain (ECC) algorithm with various binary-class imbalance learning techniques such as sampling, cost-sensitive learning, and threshold moving. This approach creates a new algorithm family called ECC++, designed specifically for class imbalance multi-label learning. ECC is already an excellent ensemble high-order binary relevance multi-label learning algorithm that is well-suited to exploiting correlations among labels. Combining it with binary-class imbalance learning techniques enables each link in a classifier chain (CC) to overcome the negative effect of skewed data distribution. ECC++ is a dynamic algorithm family that can be extended arbitrarily by applying any new binary-class imbalance learning techniques. To demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ECC++ algorithm family, we developed several ECC++ family members using some popular binary-class imbalance learning techniques. We then compared them with several state-of-the-art class imbalance multi-label learning algorithms on twelve benchmark and four real-world multilabel datasets. Our experimental results showed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ECC++ algorithm family over existing class imbalance multi-label learning algorithms. In conclusion, the proposed ECC++ algorithm family combines the strengths of the wellestablished ECC algorithm and binary-class imbalance learning techniques, resulting in a superior methodology for class imbalance multi-label learning.

ID ATTRACTIVENESS
AB Face beautification is an emerging application widely used in the entertainment industry. Previous studies have proved that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can successfully build the mapping from a general face to a target face. However, their facial style code in the latent space is taken as a black box with a lack of semantics interpretation. They usually fail to consider the geometric semantic information, and cannot focus on the facial beauty-related regions. Moreover, most of them change the background information. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel Interpretable Semantic Generative Adversarial Network (ISFB-GAN) for face beautification. First, we design a new dual-branch facial style encoder to factorize the abundant semantic information of the reference face into the facial geometry style codes and the appearance style codes in the latent space. Then, a novelty facial attention generator is proposed to preserve more background information in the generated images. In the attention generator, the facial style attention is designed to focus on the most discriminative facial region; the background attention is designed to retain the background information. Finally, we propose a hybrid loss function including geometric loss, orthogonality loss, segmentation loss, style reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, etc., to enhance the learning capacity and improve the visual quality. The combination of the geometric loss and the orthogonality loss is deployed to guarantee the disentanglement between the semantic information. Extensive experiments conducted on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset and the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset, demonstrate that ISFB-GAN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in facial attractiveness enhancement.

AB Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a prominent algorithm that offers great exploration capabilities among various meta-heuristic algorithms. However, its monotonous and one-dimensional search strategy limits its searching performance in the solving process. Thus, to address this issue, a Q-learning based multi-strategy integrated ABC algorithm (QMABC) is proposed. In the QMABC, multiple search strategies are proposed to utilize different individual experiences and search approaches for solution updates. Then, Q-learning is employed for strategy selection. In comparison to previous studies, this paper introduces more effective state and action configurations within the framework of Q-learning. To evaluate the performance of the QMABC, CEC 2017 benchmark functions are adopted to compare it to different meta-heuristic algorithms including ABC based and non-ABC based algorithms. Moreover, applications in path planning are implemented to further verify the effectiveness of the QMABC. Overall, it should be highlighted that the proposed QMABC demonstrates superiority in both numerical and practical experiments.

AB Nowadays, factors such as global climate change, environmental damage, and the impact of human activities have led to an increase in natural disasters, and the frequency of natural disaster problems is increasing, which poses a great threat to the safety of people's lives and property. The increased frequency of natural disasters has increased the need to focus on the ability to prevent and respond to disasters. The increased frequency of natural disasters has increased the need to focus on the capacity for disaster prevention and mitigation. All parties need to take appropriate measures to reduce losses and provide assistance after a disaster occurs. Among them, volunteers are a newly emerged important force for rescue, but volunteers have characteristics that normal rescue organizations do not have, such as voluntary and fragmented nature, therefore, volunteer allocation becomes an important issue today. This study tries to construct a volunteer assignment method, which takes into account several factors in the assignment, such as volunteers' own willingness to the disaster site, the competency of volunteers' various abilities, the demand of the disaster site for the task and the time satisfaction of the disaster victims, etc. L-T2FNs are introduced in the assignment process to enhance the degree of certainty; Prospect theory's value function to consider the disaster victims' psychology; This study proposes an algorithm to reduce evidence fusion conflicts. This algorithm uses a differential evolutionary algorithm based on the Dempster-Shafer theory to train the lowest conflict index (determined by K and evidence distance) for BPA fusion. Subsequently, the assignment is demonstrated by using the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey in 2023 as an arithmetic example to provide a solution to the problem of how to allocate volunteers to the appropriate disaster sites.

AB Graph embedding learning is a fundamental task when dealing with diverse datasets. While encoder-decoder architectures, such as U-Nets, have shown great success in image pixel-wise prediction tasks, applying similar methods to graph data poses challenges due to the lack of natural pooling and up-sampling operations for graphs. Recent methods leverage learnable parameters to extract structural information from neural networks and extend pooling and unpooling to graphs using node features and graph structural information. This paper proposes a novel model called GIUNet (Graph Isomorphism U-Net) for the graph classification task. The proposed Graph U-Net structure is based on graph isomorphism convolution while using a comprehensive pqPooling layer. The pqPooling layer in our approach effectively combines node features and graph structure information during the graph down-sampling stage. To incorporate graph structure information, we utilize both the spectral representation and node centrality measurements. Node centrality measurements capture various structural aspects of nodes in the graph, while the spectral representation helps us focus on the informative low frequency components of the graph structure. Through ablation studies, we have demonstrated that leveraging the GIUNet model leads to significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

AB The Particle Swarm Optimization technique (PSO) is widely used in practical applications due to its flexibility and strong optimization performance. However, like other metaheuristic algorithms, PSO has limitations, such as a propensity to become trapped in local minima and an uneven distribution of effort between exploration and exploitation stages. A novel local search technique called QPSOL, based on PSO is the proposed solution to mitigate these issues. QPSOL aims to increase diversity and achieve a closer balance between the exploration and exploitation phases. The QPSOL incorporates a dynamic optimization strategy to enhance the method's efficiency. Unlike the novel local search strategy, which uses a new local search approach (LSA) to break out of local optima, QPSOL employs quadratic interpolation around the optimal search agent to enhance its exploitation capability and solution accuracy. These strategies complement each other and contribute to boosting PSO's convergence efficiency while seeking to balance exploration and exploitation. The proposed method is assessed using the IEEE CEC'2021 test suite, and its efficacy is evaluated against other metaheuristics and cutting-edge algorithms to determine its trustworthiness. The optimal parameters of three PV models are determined using the proposed technique and compared to different well-established algorithms. Systematic comparisons show that QPSOL is competitive with, and often outperforms, commonly used methods in research for predicting model parameters.

AB Best-worst method (BWM) has received extensive attention because of its fewer pairwise comparisons and maintenance of consistency. Extending it to various fuzzy environments has become a hot research spot. This paper initiates a new interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) BWM with additive consistency. Firstly, an IVIF fuzzy preference relation (IVIFPR) is viewed as a directed graph with IVIF weights. An approach is offered to distinguish the best and worst criteria by the defined score out-degree and accuracy out-degree of criteria. The concept of IVIF reference comparisons is introduced. The additive consistency of IVIF reference comparisons is acquired by that of IVIFPR using its left and right intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. We derive the rela-tionship between the IVIF reference comparisons and the IVIF priority weight vector. Based on this relationship, a linear goal programming model is constructed to generate the IVIF priority weights. Two consistency indexes are analytically obtained and the consistency ratio is then defined to check the consistency of IVIF reference com-parisons. For the unacceptably additive consistency, a new approach is put forward to enhance the consistency. Thereby, the proposed IVIF BWM is summarized step by step. Three examples of applications are furnished to demonstrate its effectiveness and validation.

AB Breast cancer is a major cause of concern on a global scale due to its high incidence rate. It is one of the leading causes of death for women, if left untreated. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is increasingly being used in the evaluation of breast cancer. Prior studies neglected to take into account breast cancer characteristics and features that might be helpful for distinguishing the four molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The use of breast DCE-MRI to identify the molecular subtypes is now the focus of research in breast cancer analysis. It offers breast cancer patients a better chance for an early and effective treatment plan. A manually annotated dataset of 1359 DCE-MRI images was used in this study, with 70% used for training and the remaining for testing. Twelve deep features were extracted from this dataset. The dataset was initially pre-processed through placing the ROIs by a radiologist experienced in breast MRI interpretation, then deep features are extracted using the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, the deep features extracted are classified into molecular subtypes of breast cancer using the support vector machine (SVM). The effectiveness of the predictive model was assessed using accuracy and area under curve (AUC) measures. The test was performed on unseen held-out data. The maximum achieved accuracy and AUC were 99.78% and 100% respectively, with substantially a low complexity rate.

AB As changes in external weather introduce significant uncertainty into runoff prediction, probabilistic runoff forecasting becomes increasingly important for water resource managers. However, limited research has been conducted on the rational employment of decomposition techniques in probabilistic prediction, especially when considering external factors effectively. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an innovative framework for probabilistic runoff forecasting. It first utilizes the stepwise decomposition (SD) technique to obtain training and test samples. Then an integration structure considering external factors is designed to enhance the learning ability of the neural network for various features and decomposition sequences. The boundary correction process utilizes the dynamic time warping (DTW) method to optimize the boundaries of the obtained samples in SD. This comprehensive framework is named SDIFC. Building upon this framework, we achieve a synergistic integration of three distinct methods: seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on loess (STL), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and quantile regression long short-term memory (QRLSTM), named STL-LASSO-QRLSTM. Multiple experiments and evaluations demonstrate that the three methods are very well adapted to the SDIFC framework. The proposed forecasting method not only captures the runoff trend accurately but also quantifies the uncertainty in the prediction process. The proposed method exhibits significant advantages in probabilistic forecasting, achieving an average improvement of 28.1%, 35.5%, and 27.3% in continuous rank probability score (CRPS) when compared to the model without SDIFC, the model using SD in other frameworks, and the model without LASSO, respectively.

AB Several giant water diversion projects go through large expansive soil areas in China. It is challenging to ensure the slope stability of the deep excavated expansive soil canal segments due to its undesirable geologic, and physical and mechanical properties. This study develops a novel deformation prediction method for deep excavated expansive soil canal slopes based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and provides a result interpretation using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Firstly, the main factors influencing the slope deformation of deep excavated expansive soil canal segments are discussed. Subsequently, the integrated XGBoost-SHAP method is proposed for the prediction model construction of slope deformation and its result interpretation, the related the methodologies including the variational mode decomposition (VMD), XGBoost, and SHAP are also presented. The ten-fold cross-validation is employed to find the hyperparameter combination for the deformation prediction models, and the model performances are compared with common validation measurements. The effectiveness of the explanatory deformation prediction method is verified through one typical deep excavated expansive canal segment of the mid-route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. The case study shows that the VMD algorithm can well decompose the trend, periodic and fluctuating displacements. Compared with random forest and least squares-support vector machines, the XGBoost-algorithm based model achieves the better prediction performance. SHAP provides prediction result interpretations at both global and local levels. Time dependent effect and groundwater have a significant impact on the slope deformation of deep excavated expansive soil canal segments. The integrated SHAP-XGBoost method can provide a reference for predicting slope deformation of the similar projects. It can also quantify the contribution and mechanism of influencing factors on slope deformation at both global and local levels, which is conducive to implement reinforcement measures.

AB The strength of marine economic resilience (MER) determines whether a region can maintain its original development path or fall into stagnation in the face of economic shock, which is an important starting point for promoting marine economic sustainable development. We discuss the connotation and propose a logical framework for MER, which is estimated by CRITIC-TOPSIS method from 2006 to 2019 based on three dimensions (country, region, province). Furthermore, the temporal evolution trend and regional disparities are accessed by Dagum Gini coefficient. Results reveal that MER has shown a significant upward trend, and it is undergoing gradient change in China, and unfortunately, the specific performance is in the imbalance, and lack of coordination of MER in the southern marine economic circle is the most prominent. Foreseeably, the novel fractional nonlinear grey model with double optimization (DOFNGBM(1,1)) combining Grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is proposed and its performance is examined. Ulteriorly, as predicted by DOFNGBM(1,1) and presented by & sigma; convergence and & beta; convergence models, based on the cross-comparison between in-sample and out-ofsample, significant findings indicate that weak convergence of China's MER indicates that coastal areas with a low level have faster improvement rates, and MER in China will present different ways of growing delightedly. Comparatively, considering the driving factors of marine economic resilience, all of them are proven to be conducive to raising the steady-state value of MER to a higher level, despite the regional heterogeneity of their effects. Purposefully, it implies that diversified development and synergistic cooperation can improve the endogenous power of marine economic resilience.

TI A label-relevance multi-direction interaction network with enhanced

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Fire detection; Smoke recognition; Deformable convolution; Generative
   adversarial learning
AB Forest fires pose a significant threat to both the economy and ecology, causing extensive damage. Smoke serves as a crucial indicator of forest fires, often appearing before the actual fire. However, existing methods for smoke recognition are susceptible to missed alarms and false alarms due to the diverse nature of smoke and the presence of various continuous interferences in complex real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a label-relevance multi-direction interaction network with enhanced deformable convolution. Firstly, to ensure the extraction of robust features, we propose an enhanced deformable convolution module that breaks away from fixed geometric structures and incorporates interval information. Secondly, to prevent high-response high-level features from overshadowing low-level features during the feature interaction process, we introduce a multi-directional feature interaction module that obtains complementary features from different convolution layers. Lastly, to leverage the relevance and pixel distribution information in the label image, we propose a new loss term based on generative adversarial learning. This loss term measures the distribution similarity between the network's predictions and the ground truth. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model accurately estimates smoke pixels and outperforms existing smoke recognition methods.

   languages using graph-based deep neural network
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Multilingual text; Low-resource languages; Indic languages; Hashtag
   recommendation; Graph convolutional networks
AB Users from different cultures and backgrounds often feel comfortable expressing their thoughts on trending topics by generating content in their regional languages. Recently, there has been an explosion in multilingual information, and a massive amount of multilingual textual data is added daily on the Internet. Using hashtags for multilingual low-resource content can be an effective way to overcome language barriers because it allows content to be discovered by a wider audience and makes it easier for people interested in the topic to find relevant content, regardless of the language in which it was written. To account for linguistic diversity and universal access to information, hashtag recommendation for multilingual low-resource content is essential. Several approaches have been put forth to recommend content-based and personalized hashtags for multimodal content in high-resource languages. Data availability and linguistic differences often limit the development of hashtag recommendation methods for low-resource Indic languages. Hashtag recommendation for tweets disseminated in low-resource Indic languages has seldom been addressed. Moreover, personalization and language usage aspects to recommend hashtags for tweets posted in low-resource Indic languages have yet to be explored. In view of the foregoing, we propose an automated hashtag recommendation system for tweets posted in low-resource Indic languages dubbed as TAGALOG, capable of recommending personalized and language-specific hashtags. We employ user-guided and language-guided attention mechanisms to distill indicative features from low-resource tweets according to the user's topical and linguistic preferences. We propose a graph-based neural network to mine users' posting behavior by connecting historical tweets of a particular user and language relatedness by linking tweets according to language families, i.e., Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. Experimental results on the curated dataset from Twitter demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed recognized pre-trained language models and extant research, showing an average improvement of 12.3% and 12.8% in the F1-score, respectively. TAGALOG recommends hashtags that align with the user's interests and linguistic predilections, leading to a heightened level of tailored and engaging user experience. Personalized and multilingual hashtag recommendation systems for low-resource Indic languages can help to improve the discoverability and relevance of content in these languages.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic's profound impact on global health and the economy underscores the need for new computational strategies to rapidly identify potential antiviral drugs against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. AI-based drug repurposing methods have the potential to significantly shorten the drug discovery process, rendering them a crucial and efficacious approach for screening anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. In this paper, we proposed GINCM-DTA, an AI-based graph isomorphism network with protein contact map representation for drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction, and presented the COVID-DTA dataset for SARS-CoV-2-specific drug repurposing. Pre-training GINCM-DTA on large-scale Davis and KIBA datasets achieved state-of-the-art performance, while fine-tuning on the COVID-DTA dataset using transfer learning resulted in a mean square error of 0.026 and concordance index of 0.967. Utilizing the fine-tuned GINCM-DTA model, we predicted DTAs for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main targets, focusing on key conserved proteins and unmutated spike proteins for virtual screening. We integrated GINCM-DTA predictions with molecular docking simulations to identify five candidates. In vitro assays revealed Hydralazine (5.737 nM) as a potential inhibitor of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the results highlight the potential of Hydralazine as a broad-spectrum drug candidate, demonstrating its efficacy in obstructing the binding between ACE2 and spike proteins of multiple Omicron variants, including the currently dominant strains BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB.1.5, and XBB.1.16. Our method offers a novel computational strategy for COVID-19 antiviral screening and prepares for potential future epidemics incited by emerging viruses.

AB Pest detection aims to locate and classify the pests that may be present in the image, which plays a crucial role in the early warning of pests linked to the agriculture industry. However, crop pests are generally very small and uneven in scale, resulting in poor detection results. To address this challenge, we propose the Efficient ScaleAware Network (ESA-Net), which comprises three core components: a High-Level Semantic Feature Extraction Module (HSFEM), a Low-Level Feature Enhancement Module (LFEM), and a Dynamic Scale-Aware Head (DSH). To avoid network optimization confusion, we use the HSFEM to extract high-level features that build the feature pyramid networks. Then, the LFEM is designed to further optimize the integrated feature map of low-level features, providing more fine-gained information for feature extraction and improving the detector's ability to differentiate between pests with similar appearances. Additionally, the proposed DSH can improve the detection performance of small objects by adaptively selecting the appropriate detection receptive field in accordance with various object scales. Experiment results on LMPD2020 dataset (68.8% mAP) and APHIDc dataset (75.3% mAP) demonstrate that ESA-Net achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB While searching for consumer goods, users frequently ask for suggestions from their peers by writing short free-form textual requests. For example, when searching for movies users may ask for "Drama movies with a mind-bending story and a surprise ending, such as Fight Club"in one of the many online discussion boards. Despite the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP), modern recommender systems still struggle to process such requests. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate several approaches for annotating structured information from such short, free-form natural language user texts to calculate recommendations. We set up this evaluation as a two phase processes including (a) identification of the best NLP approach to identify key elements of users' requests, and (b) assessment of the quality of recommendations computed with such elements.For our evaluation, we use a gold-standard reddit movie recommendation dataset consisting of annotations, manually created by crowdworkers who extracted keywords, actor names and movie titles. Using this dataset we evaluate a collection of more than 30 NLP and five recommender approaches. In addition, we perform an ablation study to assess relative annotation importance for movie recommendations. We find that domainspecific deep learning models, trained on a subset of data as well as embedding-based recommendation approaches are able to match the recommendation performance of recommendations computed from manual annotations. These promising results warrant further investigation in automatic processing of short free-form texts for computation of recommendations. Specifically, we provide insights into which NLP models and configurations work best for automatically annotating free text to compute (movie) recommendations, hence substantially reducing the search space for combinations of NLP and recommendation algorithms in the movie and potentially other domains.

AB Computer-aided diagnosis for low-dose computed tomography (CT) based on deep learning has recently attracted attention as a first-line automatic testing tool because of its high accuracy and low radiation exposure. We propose a method based on a deep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view projection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection (VMPR-UAD) in low-dose chest CT. Presumably, this is the novel method that only requires data from healthy patients for training to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies. The method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis tools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method (1) improves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an extracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse views to serve as network inputs, (2) accommodates the input diversity gain for accurate anomaly detection, and (3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization through a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps. The proposed method based on unsupervised learning showed a high performance in pneumonia, tuberculosis, and both diseases with patient-level anomaly detection performance of 0.965 area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval (CI); (0.955, 0.972)), 0.948 AUC (95% CI; (0.928, 0.966)), and 0.963 AUC (95% CI; (0.955, 0.970)), respectively. Additionally, our technology visualizes anomalous regions in the 3D perspective. This achieved 93% accuracy in visualizing the location of lung cancer lesions through external validation. These results highlight the potential of a new AI methodology without utilizing disease data learning; this can secure AI model prediction stability by reducing the false negative rate that occurs in various patterns of diseases.

AB The mining of frequent itemsets and association rules is a core problem in data mining and an essential task in data analysis. In this paper, we present SufRec, a new algorithm for finding frequent itemsets and association rules. We give two versions. In both versions, the mining of the frequent itemsets is decomposed as a sequence of tasks. The first version (the SufRecDep algorithm) proceeds the tasks successively, each one using the results of the previous ones. The second version (the SufRecInd algorithm) performs the tasks independently of each other. Both versions are recursive with respect to the items and have thus the advantage to be particularly efficient for updating the mining process when new items are added to the database or when others are excluded. Moreover, the task-independent processing of SufRecInd makes it very easy to build parallel versions of SufRec. We present two parallel SufRec algorithms. With the first one, P-FIFO-SufRec, the processors perform the tasks according to the order in which the items appear in the database, preserving the recursive nature of SufRec. For second one, P-PAST-SufRec, the set of items is fixed and the tasks are pre-assigned to each processor. In order to evaluate the performance of SufRec, we carry out a consequent experimental study. In particular, we compare its running times with those of well-known parallel and non-parallel frequent itemsets mining algorithms.

AB High-dose single exposures of long-wavelength ultraviolet-A (UV-A) radiation may trigger severe biological and skin tissue damage in humans and animals, as well as photosynthetic damage in plants. In humans, the highly abundant UV-A is also linked to an increased risk of skin cancer. This paper develops a new forecasting framework tailored for very short-term UV-A predictions using a Bayesian optimized ensemble Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series (B-E-NBEATS) method, integrated with cloud cover predictors and the solar zenith angle. The design phase of the proposed model entails feature selection using an efficient neighborhood component analysis algorithm and hyperparameter tuning with a Bayesian optimizer. To further enhance the predictive performance and reliability, the B-E-NBEATS model is calibrated via uncertainty quantification by adopting an ensemble approach with single-point models trained on three key loss functions. The prescribed model generates interpretable forecasts of 20-minute ahead UV-A by empowering the ensemble members to learn seasonal and trend components in UV-A datasets. With respect to the four benchmark models, the statistical metrics and visual infographics of predicted and observed UV-A reveal a superior forecasting capability of the proposed B-E-NBEATS model. The model yields a comparatively high correlation coefficient of 0.910, 0.869, 0.933, and 0.900 for the spring, summer, autumn, and winter testing phases, respectively. The superior performance by the newly designed hybrid ensemble model ascertains its potential utility in UV-A monitoring and mitigating subsequent harmful exposure risk for the general public, and animal and plant life.

AB Role discovery is an emerging research area in the analysis of social networks, biological networks, and neural networks. The fundamental idea of role discovery is partitioning the vertices based on their structural features in a graph. However, most existing studies construct the role representations by learning the pairwise connectivity structures, thus weak to represent the relations among multiple vertices, namely higher-order structures. To this effect, this paper proposes a novel approach termed Low-Rank Persistent Probability representation (LRPP) for higher-order role discovery. In detail, we define local Dowker filtration to compute the persistent homology of the neighbor subgraph, which models the connection patterns among vertices and their neighbors. Then, we propose the Persistent Probability (PP) based on Dirichlet equivalence to vectorize the obtained features. Since the persistent probability matrix is sparse, we finally construct the low-rank representation to cluster the higher-order roles by embedding PP vectors into a series of linear subspaces. We conduct experiments of role discovery on both labeled and unlabeled datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed LRPP outperforms the baseline methods in role discovery and demonstrate that LRPP can effectively represent the higher-order role in graphs.

ID GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
AB In many practical many-objective optimization problems, the computational cost of real evaluation is often high. To solve such problems, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are effective methods that use low-cost surrogate models to approximate expensive real evaluation and select better-performing individuals for further evaluation. However, existing surrogate models accumulate prediction errors with increasing numbers of objectives, and the computational cost of constructing surrogate models also increases sharply. This paper proposes a composite surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for expensive many-objective optimization. The crux of this method involves categorizing the surrogate models into two distinct types: a global model, constructed based on all costly real evaluations, and local models tailored to subsets derived from clustering all evaluations. Additionally, a new filling sampling criteria is proposed to guide the selection of solutions, considering the requirements of convergence, diversity, and uncertainty. Experimental results on multiple benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive compared to other popular surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms in solving expensive many-objective optimization problems within limited computational budgets.

AB This study presents a novel dynamic localisation-based decision (DLBD) with fuzzy weighting with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) under a probabilistic single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (PSVNHFS) environment to benchmark Hybrid Multi Deep Transfer and Machine Learning (HMDTML) models. The novel DLBD method is proposed to generate a dynamic localisation decision matrix based on the upper and lower boundaries and the length of the scale. The superiority of DLBD derives from its ability to manage dynamic changes with boundary value consequences. In addition, the utilization of PSVNHFS in conjunction with DLBD and FWZIC has proven to effectively address the challenges posed by vagueness, uncertainty and hesitancy in the benchmarking procedure. The proposed methodology consists of three primary three steps: i) the adaptation of 48 HMDTML models, including 4 deep transfer learning models and 12 machine learning models trained on a dataset of 936 chest Xray images obtained from both COVID-19 patients and individuals without the disease. Then, these models were evaluated based on seven evaluation criteria, and a decision matrix was proposed. ii) The development of a PSVNH-FWZIC to assign weights to the evaluation criteria. iii) The formulation of a PSVNH-DLBD for the purpose of benchmarking HMDTML models. Results of the PSVNH-FWZIC revealed that AUC and time were the most important evaluation criteria, while precision was the least important. Furthermore, the results from PSVNH-DLBD, reveal that Model M24 (Painters-Decision Tree) earned the highest rank when & lambda; = 2,3,4, 5and6, followed by Model M25 (SqueezeNet-AdaBoost) and Model M34 (DeepLoc-kNN), while Model M39 (DeepLocSVM) had the lowest rank (rank = 48) across all & lambda; values. The proposed method underwent sensitivity and comparison analyses to confirm its reliability and robustness.

AB Tree-seed algorithm (TSA) is one of the meta-heuristic algorithms proposed recently. It has a simple but effective structure. However, for complex high-dimensional functions and constrained optimization problems, TSA has the defects of slow convergence rate and low optimization accuracy. To overcome these issues, an improved tree seed algorithm (SATSA) based on Nelder-Mead simplex method is proposed. Firstly, appropriately increase the value of the control parameters that balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the local search ability of TSA, and introduce an adaptive stochastic component of Gaussian distribution in the seed generation formula of the local search stage. Then, set the maximum retention times of each tree, for trees that exceed the maximum retention times in continuous iterations, increase the number of seeds produced by this tree, then use a new equation based on the global optimal location to generate seeds, thereby speeding up the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, after all trees produce seeds, introduce the improvement strategy with Nelder-Mead simplex method into some poor quality solutions, so that the solution with poor quality is searched deeply in the neighborhood, speeding up the process of moving the overall solution to the optimal solution. Its convergence is proved by theoretical analysis, and certifies that the time complexity of SATSA is not increased compared to TSA. The simulation results of 6 advanced algorithms on CEC2017 test suite and 10 challenging engineering constrained optimization problems demonstrate that the three strategies proposed in this study are feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Not only market signals but also disturbances of related companies influence the stock volatility of a company. Currently, most approaches that utilize inter-stock correlations rely on predetermined graphs, such as industry graphs, shareholder graphs, or event graphs, necessitating supplementary financial data. Consequently, this approach often leads to limited generalization ability of the model and incomplete representation of inter -stock relationships. Thus, this study introduces VGC-GAN, a multi-graph convolutional adversarial framework, for predicting stock prices. Initially, the proposed model generates multiple correlation graphs by analyzing historical stock data, providing a comprehensive depiction of inter-stock correlations from diverse perspectives. Subsequently, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, augmented with Mean Square Error (MSE) loss, is constructed to enhance the predictive performance of the model. The framework combines Multi-Graph Convolutional Network (Multi-GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as the generator. It undergoes supervised and adversarial training with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), facilitating the in-depth exploration of hidden correlations between stocks and time dependence of stocks. To mitigate the impact of noise, VGC-GAN uses subsequences after Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with optimized parameters as input to the generator. The proposed model is evaluated on several real datasets, and the experimental results confirm its effectiveness in stock price prediction.

AB Nowadays, users across the globe interact with one another for information exchange, communication, and association on various online social media. However, some individuals exploit these venues for malicious practices like hate speech and cyberbully. In this paper, we present an improved multilingual hate speech and cyberbully detection model using bagging-stacking based hybrid ensemble deep learning techniques. The proposed model utilizes Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) techniques to enhance the overall performance. We first preprocess the multilingual data streams followed by adoption of Global vectors for word Representation (GloVe) embeddings to convert words to a vector representation in parallel enabling the data streams for binary classification task. In order to construct an architecture for the detection of hate speech and cyberbully, we introduce a heterogeneous fusion of multiple effective models in a unique approach such that CNN-LSTM utilizes a stacking approach with stochastic gradient descent to achieve optimal weights, whereas all the base learners used bagging ensemble approach with cross-validation to reach optimal weights. The final output layer of the proposed ensemble deep learning architecture is achieved using a super learner approach on base learners. To show the efficacy of the proposed model, we conduct the simulation on a total of nine real-world social media datasets in different languages and compared the results with other contemporary hate speech and cyberbully detection methods. The collected findings show that the proposed model outperforms other models on considered datasets and shows an improvement of at least 4.44% in F1 scores.

ID PROTECTION SCHEME; FEATURES
AB Phishing websites distribute unsolicited content and are frequently used to commit email and internet fraud. Detecting them before any user information is submitted is critical. Several efforts have been made to detect these phishing websites in recent years. Most existing approaches use hand-crafted lexical and statistical features from a website's textual content to train classification models to detect phishing web pages. However, these phishing detection approaches have limitations, including (1) the tediousness of extracting hand-crafted features, which require specialized domain knowledge to determine which features are useful for a particular platform; and (2) the difficulties encountered by models built on hand-crafted features to capture the semantic patterns in words and characters in URL and HTML content. To address these challenges, this paper proposes WebPhish, an end-to-end deep neural network trained using embedded raw URLs and HTML content to detect website phishing attacks. First, the proposed model automatically employs an embedding technique to extract the corresponding characters into homologous dense vectors. Then, the concatenation layer merges the URL and HTML embedding matrices. Following that, Convolutional layers are used to model its semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted with real-world phishing data, which yielded an accuracy of 98.1%, showing that WebPhish outperforms baseline detection approaches in identifying phishing pages.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Image fusion enhances a single image by integrating information from multiple sources with complementary data. Present end-to-end fusion methods often face overfitting or intricate parameter tuning due to inadequate task-specific training data. To address this, two-stage approaches utilize encoder-decoder networks trained on extensive natural image datasets, yet suffer from limited performance due to domain disparities. In this work, we devise a novel encoder-decoder fusion framework and introduce a self-supervised scheme based on destruction-reconstruction. This approach facilitates task-specific feature learning by proposing three auxiliary tasks: pixel intensity non-linear transformation for multi-modal fusion, brightness transformation for multi-exposure fusion, and noise transformation for multi-focus fusion. By randomly selecting one task during model training, we mutually reinforce different fusion tasks, enhancing network generalizability. We innovate an encoder combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer to extract both local and global features. Rigorous evaluations against 11 traditional and deep learning-based methods span four benchmark datasets: infrared-visible fusion, medical fusion, multi-exposure fusion, and multi-focus fusion. Comprehensive assessments, encompassing nine metrics from diverse viewpoints, consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in all scenarios. We will make our code, datasets, and fused images publicly available.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; SELECTION
AB Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has shown good performance on many optimization problems. However, these problems mainly focus on single-objective and ordinary multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), ABC encounters some difficulties. The selection pressure based on Pareto-dominance degrades severely. It is hard to balance convergence and population diversity. To help ABC solve MaOPs, this paper proposes an improved two-archive many-objective ABC (called MaOABC-TA) algorithm. Inspired by the improved two-archive (Two_Arch2) method, MaOABC-TA uses two archives namely convergence archive (CA) and diversity archive (DA) to promote convergence and diversity. Based on CA and DA, three different search strategies are designed to strengthen convergence or diversity in different search stages. In addition, a new probability selection strategy is proposed to choose solutions with good diversity. To verify the performance of MaOABC-TA, it is compared with 10 many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) and 3 many-objective ABCs on DTLZ and MaF benchmark sets with 3, 5, 8, and 15 objectives. Two performance indicators including inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV) and utilized. Experimental results show that MaOABC-TA is more competitive than the compared algorithms in term of the IGD and HV values.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB An essential aspect of intelligent driving systems is the automatic lane-changing function. However, in real -world traffic situations, the initially planned lane-changing trajectory can become hazardous due to the intricate and unpredictable nature of human driving behavior. Based on the assumption that vehicles have risks during lane-changing, an integrated methodology is proposed to assess the hazards associated with road conditions in real-time and to quickly adjust the predetermined vehicle trajectory, if deemed necessary, to mitigate the risks of conflicting lane changes. Vehicles are encouraged to adhere to lane changing behavior by adjusting their trajectory, aiming to enhance traffic efficiency. Instead of immediately abandoning lane changing, vehicles should strategically assess the situation before making decisions. Initially, an analysis of variables influencing re-planning is conducted, determining the circumstances conducive to maintaining lane -changing behavior. Subsequently, a trajectory re-planning module is introduced, facilitated by two neural network data-fitting models, allowing real-time performance. Finally, a series of numerical experiments confirm that the devised method effectively guides autonomous driving through quick and secure lane change re-planning in high-risk traffic environments. The proposed novel approach extends the capacity to target traffic flow gaps and dynamically re-plan lane switching motivations, ensuring the vehicle can persist in lane-changing rather than reverting to the original lane.

ID RGB-T TRACKING
AB Recent years have witnessed the exciting performance of trackers based on Transformer. However, they usually separate the process of information extraction and integration, weakening the information interaction between the target and search region. In addition, they depend on traditional Transformer to model the long range dependency, which leads to a lack of focus on the primary information needed by high-accuracy trackers. In this paper, a sparse mixed attention aggregation model is proposed for robust tracking based on visible and thermal infrared images. To be specific, a backbone network composed of sparse mixed attention is designed to achieve information extraction and integration. This is helpful to obtain specific discriminative feature information and enhance their communication. To give full play to the complementary visible and thermal information, a confidence aware aggregation network is designed, which can learn the reliable confidence of visible and thermal branches. Finally, a corner-based localization head is introduced to estimate the target state. Extensive experiments on three large-scale multimodal tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superior tracking ability of the proposed tracker over other advanced trackers.

   vision; Convolutional neural networks
AB Having a tiny scale and few identifiable features, small objects are particularly difficult to detect, especially when the image resolution is not high. Further, large-scale variation across object instances places a burden on small object detection. In view of the insufficient detection ability of YOLOF (You Only Look One-level Feature) detector for small objects at low resolution, we propose an effective method, named YOLOFs, to boost small object detection precision in the case of object instances scale variation. The proposed three key modules (feature fusion module, visual perception module and feature encoding module) expand the receptive field of the network and greatly improve small object detection precision. Extensive experiments on the COCO, VOC, and Fire datasets prove the effectiveness of our method while keeping the detector simple and accurate. Without bells and whistles, our method outperforms YOLOF 5.1 AP (average precision), 6.2 AP, and 4.9 AP on small object detection at 704x704 , 608x608, and 512 x 512 resolutions, respectively, and it also achieves better performance on the VOC and Fire datasets. Our code will be made publicly available.

AB Asthmatic patients suffer episodic attacks of breathing difficulty and cough. Cough sounds may be used to distinguish asthma from other lung conditions or normal, especially in the acute period. We aimed to develop a novel architecture using lightweight, handcrafted components that could still extract meaningful features. Cough sounds were recorded using mobile phones from 1428 asthmatic and healthy subjects. As cough sounds behave similarly to random noises, we used a global chaotic logistic pattern (GCLP) as a kernel for feature generation based on its ability to detect random relations among input signal values. Further, each cough sound was preprocessed to remove speech and silent periods before undergoing signal decomposition using tunable Q wavelet transformation (TQWT). The latter enabled downstream GCLP-based feature generation at multiple levels, which yielded four final feature vectors (which corresponded to the four types of TQWT-generated wavelet subbands), each of length 3584. Four feature selectors were applied to the latter, generating 16 selected feature vectors, each of length 256. A standard shallow cubic support vector machine was deployed to calculate 16 prediction vectors, which were collectively input to a mode-based iterative hard majority voting function to generate additional 15voted results. Finally, a greedy algorithm automatically chose the best overall result, which made the model selforganized. Our model attained 99.44% classification accuracy for the collected dataset. Furthermore, our model obtained an accuracy of 98.53% with leave-one- subject-out cross-validation (LOSO CV) strategy, which justifies the robustness of the developed model.

AB The geometric and thermal errors are the crucial errors that directly impact the machining accuracy, and then the crucial errors should be controlled. However, the prediction model is not robust and accurate enough, and the real-time performance of the control system is weak. To address the above challenges, the thermal error models are proposed based on the extreme gradient boosting algorithm-improved sailed fish optimizer-bi-directional ordered neurons-long short-term memory neural network. The critical input variables are identified by extreme gradient boosting. The hyper-parameters of bi-directional ordered neurons-long short-term memory neural network are adaptively optimized by improved sailed fish optimizer. Moreover, the control model is proposed by analyzing the analytical mapping relationship between the compensation component of each axis and crucial errors. Finally, the physical-edge-cloud system is designed to control the crucial errors of precision boring machine tools in real time. The prediction model and control model are embedded into the edge layer. The prediction model is trained on the cloud layer of physical-edge-cloud system. For the thermal error of the spindle system, the predictive ability of the extreme gradient boosting-improved sailed fish optimizer-bi-directional ordered neurons-long short-term memory neural network model is 96.39%. For the thermal error of the linear axis, the predictive abilities of extreme gradient boosting-improved sailed fish optimizer-bi-directional ordered neurons-long short-term memory neural network model are 90.41%, 92.00%, 95.47%, 97.84%, and 91.87% at 1h, 3h, 5h, 7h, and 9h, respectively. Furthermore, the machining error is reduced by more than 75.00% with the application of the designed physical-edge-cloud system.

AB This paper proposes a real-time state of health (SOH) estimation model based on a deep learning (DL) framework. The proposed model is a combination of two different architectures; a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The hybrid CNN-BiGRU uses the 1D CNN layers to extract pertinent features from input data and then relies on the BiGRU layers for sequence learning in both directions. To account for all SOH indicators, the proposed approach uses the current, voltage, and temperature measurements, which are readily obtainable from the electric vehicle's battery management system (BMS). This prevents the complex and time-consuming feature extraction used in most related papers. Since the hyperparameters have a significant impact on the performance of neural network models, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) technique based on the Gaussian Process (GP) was considered to tune the CNN-BiGRU model hyperparameters. Accordingly, the objective function was able to converge to a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.2 x 10-5 in just 19 iterations. Afterward, to verify the accuracy of the optimized model, a Lithium-ion battery dataset with several discharge profiles provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was used. The obtained results demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method compared to other commonly used models. The CNN-BiGRU model yielded a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.080% and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.516% in the case of the battery set #C, referring to a set with 70 cycles already used at 24 degrees C. Additionally, the End of life (EOL) indicator error of zero cycles for the same data.

AB Different kinds of fire accidents can occur during industrial activities that involve hazardous materials, such as jet fires, which are often involved in a process known as a domino effect that generates a sequence of other accidents of greater magnitude. Jet fires present specific features that can significantly increase the probability of this domino effect, so they become relevant from a risk analysis perspective, making their proper characterization a crucial task. Data acquisition of jet fires involves expensive experiments, especially when infrared imagery is necessary. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to produce plausible infrared images from visible ones, making experiments less expensive and allowing for other potential applications. As validation, the infrared images are used in a fire characterization approach that employs Deep Learning to segment radiation zones and extracts the jet fire's geometrical information. A comparison is done between the measurements obtained from real and generated infrared images. The results suggest that, with the proposed approach, it is possible to realistically replicate the analysis obtained from experiments carried out using both visible and infrared cameras.

AB Individuals' attention and sentiment are the keys to adopting electric vehicles (EVs). Traditional questionnaires and interviews cannot fully and accurately reflect the attention and sentiments. Social media interactions can provide a new data-driven perspective to explore the sentiment toward EVs. This study uses data from public posts on Weibo to investigate intersectionality in EV - sentiment and attention as per user, gender and region. On a 1,149,243-text corpus extracted from the Weibo posts, a computational social science methodology was employed with a mixed-method of deep learning and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Results showed that attention toward EVs mainly comes from official users rather than individual users (IUs), and IUs' attention is closely linked with EV policy change. Additionally, the attention level and growth rate toward EVs vary across regions and men pay more attention to EVs. There exist significant differences in both positive and negative sentiment driving factors across genders. This study facilitates to EVs' policy-making and strategy in China and other countries.

DE Multi-task learning; Code-mixing; Code-switching; AdapterFusion
AB Social media text can be classified in different ways, viz sentiment analysis, humour detection, hate speech detection and hope speech detection. Multitask learning (MTL) models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) eliminate the need to build separate models for each of these tasks. However, building MTL models by fully fine-tuning the LLM has limitations such as catastrophic forgetting and requiring complete retraining to add a new task. AdapterFusion was introduced to address these limitations. However, existing AdapterFusion techniques have not been experimented with code-mixed or code-switched text. Moreover, they only considered task-based AdapterFusion on monolingual LLMs. However, using monolingual LLMs is suboptimal in classifying code-mixed or code-switched text. A better alternative is multilingual LLMs. In this paper, we present an MTL model that combines task AdapterFusion with language adapters on top of a multilingual LLM. We combine language adapters sequentially, in parallel, and as a fusion with task adapters to capture cross-lingual knowledge in code-mixed and code-switched text. We believe that this is the first research to introduce language-based AdapterFusion.

AB In recent years, due to the increasing demands for environmental monitoring, disaster warning, urban management, and national defense development, the construction of earth observation platforms has become a strategic requirement for countries in the aerospace sector. Autonomous airships in near space are highly competitive in terms of endurance, power consumption, and coverage area. An important aspect of earth observation is task scheduling, which generates allocation decisions under certain constraints. However, in the current literature, there is insufficient research in this field, which is crucial for human safety. Therefore, it is imperative to establish models to fill the research gap in this area. The novelties and our contributions to the paper are as follows. (i) Based on the consideration of distance, resolution, energy, and time constraints, the multi-airship earth-observation task scheduling (MAEOTS) model is developed to maximize the observation quality and minimize the energy cost. (ii) To solve this model efficiently, a three-stage multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (TSEA) based on sparsity knowledge combined with three indicators (SKTI) is proposed, also called TSEA/SKTI. (iii) Using three types of sparsity knowledge to guide the genetic operator and introducing the fitness evaluation strategy of three indicators for population selection, the competitiveness of populations in diversity and convergence is improved. (iv) A combination of decision variable score and number of tasks is used to initialize the populations. An adaptive strategy is designed to determine the range of operator crossover and mutation. The degree of crowding determined by the sharing function between individuals is used for environmental selection. The experiment was repeated in 4 data sets while comparing with 4 relevant popular evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has advantages in terms of effectiveness and diversity of solutions, and demonstrates excellent characteristics in solving the MAEOTS model, exhibiting good time robustness and complexity. An actual case study in Zhuo Zhou City has been conducted to assess the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model.

AB Decomposed fuzzy sets (DFSs) are one of the latest extensions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are introduced to express vague and imprecise information to be used in multi-criteria decision-making. DFSs represent the human thinking structure in a multidirectional way, and they enable it through functional and dysfunctional judgments. However, DFSs cannot completely represent the entire human mindset as they are incapable of capturing reliability information, as it is in the other extensions, and this inability may cause wrong decisions to be given. To handle this problem, decomposed Z-fuzzy numbers, which are the integrated DFSs with reliability information provided by Z-fuzzy numbers, are introduced to model functional and dysfunctional judgments for taking the consistency of decision makers into account. Collecting judgments with both their fuzzy restrictions and fuzzy reliabilities from decision makers based on functional and dysfunctional questions provide more consistent and reliable judgments in the practice. Subsequently, a new decomposed Z-fuzzy linguistic scale and defuzzification formula are introduced to reach a final solution. Then, decomposed Z-fuzzy TOPSIS method is developed. Finally, we analyze the effect of the reliability parameter on the given decisions and present a comparative analysis with crisp TOPSIS method by an application of transfer center location selection for a private cargo company in Marmara Region of Turkey.

AB The ongoing challenge of addressing critical issues related to intelligent cooperative control and active protection persists due to the absence of a comprehensive and efficient integrated solution. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a brain-inspired controller that emulates the collaborative functionalities of various brain regions, harnessing the power of spiking neural networks. The controller's primary tasks include reference velocity tracking, cooperative control, and active protection, with a special focus on cooperative protection within distinct operational modes. Furthermore, the fundamental principles of incorporating spiking neural networks into train control, such as coding and decoding mechanisms, are expounded. The overarching controller is partitioned into two principal functional segments. The first segment involves emulating the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for reference velocity tracking and active protection against overspeed and collisions through motor control and movement planning. The second segment employs a cerebellum-inspired network for cooperative control. Additionally, the brain-inspired network introduced in this study undergoes training utilizing biologically-inspired mechanisms, incorporating dopamine and pertinent teaching signals to facilitate realistic synaptic modifications. Simulation results in several scenarios validate the proposed approach.

AB Most deep learning-based object detection methods are proposed based on multi-level feature environments. Although some researchers have tried to detect on one-level features, where multiple feature maps are utilized. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel anchor-free object detection approach with an automatic label assignment strategy on only one feature map. The proposed method follows the main idea of AutoAssign to achieve the label assignment strategy. However, to make the strategy work appropriately in one feature map environment, several modifications have been made. A prior knowledge fusion method called 'Center Weighting Fusion' is proposed for label assignment strategy, where the Gaussian mixture model function is applied to calculate the weights of each object on one feature map. By doing so, some objects that are close to each other, whose weights will be merged and generate some points (Recheck Points) that are shared with multiple objects. For those 'Recheck Points,' the detector will judge how many objects share this point and generate a corresponding number of different-sized proposals. In detecting different-sized objects, we propose a 'Uniform Detection' method to limit each point's regression distance according to the target's category. A large number of experimental data show that the proposed method presents competitive detection accuracy with normal anchor-free detectors (43.8% mAP), while it is smaller (30% smaller) and faster (50% better).

AB Fuel ethanol represents a future energy trajectory, and the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) technique emerges as the principal approach for ethanol production. This scholarly inquiry offers an innovative means to monitor the SSF process for ethanol meticulously. Employing a profound fusion strategy that effectively amalgamates diverse data sources. The convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures are thoughtfully crafted and designed to enable autonomous feature self-learning from near-infrared spectra and electronic nose data. These intricately devised networks further implement data fusion strategies at the granular level of features. Ultimately, a deep fusion correction model was devised and rigorously validated using two distinct data sources, namely near-infrared spectroscopy and electronic nose data. The obtained results demonstrate a discernible improvement in the overall predictive accuracy of the model when employing the fusion feature strategy, surpassing the model constructed solely on a single technical data source. Regarding the monitoring of ethanol content, the optimal RNN fusion model exhibited remarkable performance metrics, with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 3.2265, a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9880, and a relative percent deviation (RPD) value of 9.2662. In terms of monitoring glucose content, the optimal RNN fusion model also demonstrated commendable performance, with the following respective parameters: RMSEP was 3.2770, R2 was 0.9840, and RPD was 8.0085. The overall results indicate that the multisensor data fusion strategy not only improves the performance of the model but also provides valuable insights into the fermentation process.

AB Automatic extraction of flame area plays an important role in forest fire detection, which can accurately understand the spatial distribution and development trend of forest fire, so as to effectively realize the protection of forest resources. However, due to the instability and spread of fires, and the complexity of the background, accurate early fire detection is extremely challenging. At the same time, the image pixel proportion of the flame area in early stage is much smaller than that in the background, which causes a serious class imbalance problem. With the fast development of deep learning, some achievements have been made in flame extraction, but there are still some deficiencies in the existing networks, such as limited feature representation, poor feature capturing ability on micro objects, insufficiency processing of local features, etc. This paper proposes an attention-based dual-encoding segmentation network, abbreviated as ADE-Net, for pixelwise early fire detection. To realize strong feature representation, a dual-encoding path, consisting of semantic units and spatial units, is introduced to extract richer features, and an attention fusion module (AFM) is introduced to fully integrate spatial and semantic information and achieve effective feature aggregation. In addition, faced with the class imbalance problem, a multi-attention fusion (MAF) module is introduced to obtain more discriminating features to make the segmentation network to focus on the key pixel areas. Furthermore, a feature enhancement module, named attention-guided enhancement (AGE) module, is proposed to enrich the feature representation of local feature maps. Finally, to realize better multi-scale global feature extraction and fusion, a global context fusion (GCF) module is proposed into the bottleneck layer for multi-scale feature enhancement. Experimental results show that the proposed ADE-Net has a good early fire detection ability from remote sensing images, and it has obtained a competitive advantage compared with advanced segmentation models.

AB One of the most important features of a reliable power system is its capability to supply the demand continuously. This continuous supply has been maintained by the transient stability of the system against large disturbances. The study of this type of stability is examined through different indicators. One of the common indicators to evaluate the transient stability of the power system is the well-known Critical Clearing Time (CCT) index. Conventional methods for calculating CCT have presented good accuracy, however, their computational cost is very high which makes them not suitable for real-time applications and real large-scale networks. Considering their ability to feature extraction of big data, deep neural networks can be utilized as reliable tools to cover these deficiencies. In this regard, to cover the shortcomings of the conventional methods, this paper proposes a method based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate the CCT index in real-time power system applications. Moreover, to analyze a realistic case, nonlinear limiters of the excitation systems which have a considerable effect on transient stability index are considered in this study. Thanks to the using of several deep layers and the comprehensive established database, the accuracy of proposed method is appropriately high. Numerical studies on IEEE standard networks as well as a real case in Iran Power Grid (IPG) represents the advantages of the proposed method.

AB In this study, the authors combined the research on loose particle signal and component signal identification with the research on loose particle material identification for the first time, providing comprehensive and reliable loose particle detection results. Based on this, a signal detection and material identification method for loose particles inside sealed relays based on fusion classification model is proposed. Due to the limitations of technical means and confidentiality management, the authors made a real sealed relay sample, and took it as the research object. Through the steps of data acquisition, signal processing, feature engineering, and model training, the dedicated component identification feature library and material identification feature library was constructed, respectively, the component identification model and material identification model based on parameteroptimized SVM with linear kernel and XGBoost was trained, respectively. For the seal relay to be tested, through the steps of data acquisition, signal processing and feature engineering, the data set to be tested was created. The component identification model was used to identify component signals with loose particle signals, and the material identification model was used to identify the materials of loose particles. The majority voting process was used to convert the classification results into identification results, resulting in loose particle detection and material identification results. In addition, the general procedure steps of the proposed method for physical testing were given, and the identification accuracy for device-level loose particle detection was newly proposed. The loose particle testing event containing thirty-seven identification tasks shows that, the achieved identification accuracy was 97.30%, and 92.16% of the average classification accuracy was achieved by the component identification model, 80.41% of the average classification accuracy was achieved by the material identification model. This effectively demonstrates the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method in this paper. It is an important supplement to the loose particle detection research, and provides references for signal detection in similar fields.

TI Online cross session electromyographic hand gesture recognition using

AB In recent years, hand gesture recognition in human-computer interfaces is usually based on surface electromyography because the signals are non-intrusive and are not affected by the variations of light, position, and orientation of the hand. Deep learning algorithms have become increasingly more prominent in gesture recognition for the ability to automatically learn features from large amounts of data. However, delicate and complicated network structures brought by deep learning, which are elaborately designed for cross session tasks, need more computing time to be trained and tested, which can hardly be applied to the online system. In this study, an online electromyographic hand gesture recognition method using deep learning and transfer learning is proposed. The deep learning model includes a feature extractor, a label classifier, and a gesture predictor. The feature extractor is based on the temporal convolutional network, which is designed to learn high-level discriminant features from the input signals. The label classifier includes three fully connected layers, designed to classify hand gesture labels using the feature vector which is produced by the feature extractor. The gesture predictor uses a threshold voting algorithm to predict the gesture, used at the stage of testing to perform the online recognition. Transfer learning technique is used to transfer model parameters from one pre-trained model, which costs less time and can be applied for online applications. The proposed model is verified on both the Myo dataset and the public NinaPro database. The proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly enhance the performance of the proposed model on the two datasets, only using no more than three sessions to retrain the label predictor can achieve the accuracy of more than 90% of that obtained though the normal training of the whole parts of the model using full training sessions.

AB Based on the incredible breadth and speed of information distribution within social media network, and continuous development of natural language processing techniques for sentiment and topic analyses, it is potential to access online public opinions on major accidents. An integrated framework including four-stage evolution model, lexicon-based sentiment analysis, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic extraction was developed based upon social media data analysis. The explosion of Xiangshui eco-chemical industrial zone (EXEIZ) was taken as a case for investigating the evolution of online public opinions. The large accident domain (LAD)-based sentiment dictionary was established for the lexicon-based approach for sentiment determination. Effective methods (i.e., combination of short microblogs and comments into a new text, and the hybrid approach integrating perplexity with principal component analysis) were deployed for overcoming two typical short-comings (i.e., inappropriate for short text dataset, and sensitive to the number of topics within a corpus) of the LDA-based approach for topic analysis and extraction. According to the four-stage evolution model, customized strategies and suggestions were provided for guiding and controlling online public opinions on major accidents, in order to decrease their negative impacts on the society. This enabled conducting targeted communication efforts among different stakeholders for the reduction of negative sentiments such as indignation, sadness, and threat, and the avoidance of social media crises. Although a major accident poses tangible threats to the public, it may improve their awareness for preventing from these threats. In case of appropriate measures in time, the focus tends to steer toward effective and prosocial solutions. It is helpful for sustaining and re-establishing the image of authorities, enterprises or individuals that are closely associated with the major accident.

AB Heat balance plays a significant role in reflecting the health state of aluminum electrolysis process (AEP). However, current methods hardly take into consideration the quantitative Heat Balance Indicator (HBI) construction by using the unlabeled data. In addition, it is limited to construct HBI by learning the complex relationship between degraded features and large-scale HBI labels in a supervised manner, because the labeled data are scarce and annotations are expensive in practice. To quantitatively construct HBI by using the unlabeled data, this paper proposes an unsupervised HBI construction method based on variational autoencoder (VAE). Firstly, we propose fuzzy evaluation strategy to estimate the tendency of cell temperature to highlight the trend of heat balance. Rather than simply using the latent features, we extract the feature representation of the heat balance state considering not only the latent features but also the reconstruction error. Finally, HBI is constructed by calculating the distance between the features representation of normal heat balance and degraded state. The applications of heat balance monitoring in a real-world aluminum electrolysis plant are performed to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HBI construction method can better represent heat balance state of AEP, the average fault detection rate can achieve 80% for the monitoring electrolytic cells, increasing by more than 3% compared with these traditional monitoring statistics.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Researches on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of aero-engine could help to make maintenance plans, improve operation reliabilities and reduce maintenance costs. While deep learning methods have been widely used in RUL prediction research, most deep learning-based RUL prediction methods tend to treat input features as equally important. Contributions of different channels and time steps from input features are not considered simultaneously, which will inevitably affect efficiencies and accuracies of RUL prediction. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based RUL prediction method named attention-based temporal convolutional network (ATCN) is proposed in this article. First, an improved self-attention mechanism is used to weight contributions of different time steps from input features. Input features of time steps closely related to RUL are enhanced by the improved self-attention mechanism, which could improve efficiencies of feature extraction in a network. Then, a temporal convolutional network is constructed to capture long-term dependent information and extract feature representations from weighted features of the improved self-attention mechanism. Next, a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism is adopted to weight contributions of different channels from feature representations, which could help to improve prediction accuracies of the network. Finally, a fully connected layer is constructed to fuse weighted features to output RUL values. A commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset from NASA is applied to verify effects of the proposed method. Performances of the proposed method are compared with those based on different neural network architectures, such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, DCNN, TCN, BiGRU-TSAM, AGCNN and channel attention plus Transformer. Results show that the proposed method could yield results with higher accuracy for RUL prediction of aero-engine than other methods.

ID RULE CHECKING
AB Interpreting regulatory documents or building codes into computer-processable formats is essential for the intelligent design and construction of buildings and infrastructures. Although automated rule interpretation (ARI) methods have been investigated for years, most of them are highly dependent on the early and manual filtering of interpretable clauses from a building code. While few of them considered machine interpretability, which represents the potential to be transformed into a computer-processable format, from both clause- and document-level. Therefore, this research aims to propose a novel approach to automatically evaluate and enhance the machine interpretability of single clauses and building codes. First, a few categories are introduced to classify each clause in a building code considering the requirements for rule interpretation, and a dataset is developed for model training. Then, an efficient text classification model is developed based on a pretrained domain-specific language model and transfer learning techniques. Finally, a quantitative evaluation method is proposed to assess the overall interpretability of building codes. Experiments show that the proposed text classification algorithm outperforms the existing CNN- or RNN-based methods, by improving the F1-score from 72.16% to 93.60%. It is also illustrated that the proposed classification method can enhance downstream ARI methods with an improvement of 4%. Furthermore, analysis of more than 150 building codes in China showed that their average interpretability is only 34.40%, which implies that it is still difficult to fully transform an entire regulatory document into computer-processable formats. It is also argued that the interpretability of building codes should be further improved both from the human side (considering certain constraints when writing building codes) and the machine side (developing more powerful algorithms, tools, etc.).

AB Stuck pipe represents one of the main anomalies of oil well drilling operations, responsible for economic, operational, and safety issues. However, it is possible to infer early signs of stuck pipe from the process variables, which improves the performance of the operation teams and avoids its occurrence. In this scenario, machine learning techniques have been used to prevent stuck pipe. However, such techniques strictly depend on the characteristics of the available data set, which, for the problem at hand, are typically unbalanced. On the other hand, expert systems are an alternative to machine learning algorithms because they capture the tacit knowledge of operators. This work presents a system for preventing stuck pipe based on fuzzy logic applied to special features derived from the process variables. In addition, a deep analysis of the behavior of the process variables in real time is presented. The features of the process variables allow generalization, identifying early signs of stuck pipe in different wells. The application of the proposed early sign fuzzy detection system to fourteen cases of stuck pipe in four different offshore oil wells on the Brazilian coast demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting stuck pipe's occurrence. The performance of the proposed system was measured using precision/recall score and the advance time for the stuck pipe to occur, showing that more than 92% of the stuck cases could have been avoided. Finally, a comparison with four well-known classifiers highlighted the best overall performance of the proposed approach.

AB In supply chain management, selection of suitable suppliers and allocating corresponding orders are two essential strategic decisions. Making these decisions is a complex process due to some uncertain parameters, such as future demand. This study proposes a three-stage solution framework to solve problems with supplier selection & order allocation planning. In Stage 1, a new modified relational deep learning forecasting technique is developed to forecast the demands of products. In this part, the efficiency of this modified technique is compared with two well-known forecasting techniques, namely Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Light-Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM). In Stage 2, a new hybrid principal component analysis method is used to generate suppliers' weights. The results from Stages 1 and 2 are used in the multiple objectives optimization model which is developed in Stage 3. The hybrid method is used to derive a set of efficient solutions. The developed framework is discussed using a real dataset from the Canadian meat industry. The results of forecasting models show that the developed deep learning network can reduce the forecasting error by 55.42% when compared to the SARIMA method, and 13.1% when compared to the LGBM method. It is also observed that the consideration of inter-product correlation functions can change the selected suppliers and the corresponding orders.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Recently, machine learning has revolutionized medical diagnosis and prediction, rivaling human experts in accuracy. However, the limited interpretability poses challenges in meeting stringent medical decision standards. To facilitate interpretable predictive inference, this article proposes a small samples-oriented intrinsically explainable machine learning model, an Optimal Variational Bayesian Logistic Regression (OVBLR) model with a salient feature estimation strategy (OVBLR-SFE). OVBLR-SFE sequentially learns from limited labeled samples, mining disease-related risk factors to provide intrinsic interpretability to its predictive inference automatically. The model achieves this by reasonably approximating the posterior probability through the proposed OVBLR model to estimate the feature weight and influential effect on model outputs to facilitate salient feature selection. The effectiveness and superiority of OVBLR-SFE are demonstrated through extensive experiments on four benchmark medical datasets from the UCI repository, including the Bone Marrow Transplant: Children Data Set, Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set, SPECT Heart Data Set, and Heart Disease Data Set, as well as a real-world case of intensive care unit readmission prediction. Experimental results reveal that the OVBLR-SFE can achieve high accuracies of 92.02%, 97.21%, 86.71%, and 84.47%, respectively, with an average classification accuracy of 90.10% stably on the four UCI datasets. Especially, OVBLR-SFE can accurately infer significant features that align with that obtained by the post-hoc interpretation approaches: SHAP and AcME, demonstrating remarkable interpretability. In the real application, the proposed method achieved a readmission prediction accuracy of 88.11% in predicting the readmission probabilities of liver transplantation patients. Notably, the inferred salient features, such as total Intensive Care Unit length of stay (ICUTime), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide(NTproBNP), Operating time of surgery(OperationTime_h), and intraoperative red blood cell transfusion (RBCT), emerges as crucial in readmission prediction, aligning with the assessments of clinical experts.

AB Clinicians' decision-making is of utmost importance during critical situations. Thus, integrating Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) may assist the medical staff by enhancing the decision-making process, eventually improving patient outcomes. The potential of an autonomous CDSS, proficient in predicting and guiding medical treatment, is significant-especially in situations where every second counts. We proposed a methodology to design a CDSS based on observational data of clinical procedures. This approach employs graph-convolutional networks (GCN) to encapsulate medical knowledge from simulated clinical procedures with sequential data. Consequently, our model can extrapolate from these procedures, identifying novel structural and characteristic combinations. This innovative method harnesses information that might elude human observers. Moreover, our model generates action sequences that a human physician has not previously executed. Traditional techniques tend to fall short in adapting to changing trends, thus failing to anticipate human actions. Conversely, advanced models like GCN have demonstrated promising potential in tasks like human action prediction, including activity recognition. We assessed these performances using benchmark datasets, which yielded encouraging results. Additionally, we constructed a graph-based CDSS to deliver pertinent medical advice. We outline a methodology to monitor the procedure's current stage and predict the physician's subsequent action, facilitating time-saving measures like pre-emptive instrument preparation. Our novel CDSS methodology achieved an F1-score of 0.899 and 0.714 when performing one and two-step predictions, respectively. Furthermore, our simulations illustrate a considerable time-saving potential, with an average reduction of approximately 00:01:28 +/- 00:01:15 min in the preparation time for adrenaline dosage, a crucial component for successful resuscitation.

AB Lower limb disorders are a substantial contributor to both disability and lower standards of life. The prevalent disorders affecting the lower limbs include osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and ankle. The present study focuses on the use of footwear that incorporates force-sensing resistor sensors to classify lower limb disorders affecting the knee, hip, and ankle joints. The research collected data from a sample of 117 participants who wore footwear integrated with force-sensing resistor sensors while walking on a predetermined walkway of 9 meters. Extensive preprocessing and feature extraction techniques were applied to form a structured dataset. Several machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated. According to the findings, the Random Forest model exhibited the highest level of performance on the balanced dataset with an accuracy rate of 96%, while the Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy rate of 91%. The accuracy scores of the Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Long Short-Term Memory models were comparatively lower. K-fold cross-validation was also performed to evaluate the models' performance. The results indicate that the integration of force-sensing resistor sensors into footwear, along with the use of machine learning techniques, can accurately categorize lower limb disorders. This offers valuable information for developing customized interventions and treatment plans.

TI Learning node representations against perturbations

DT Article
DE Graph neural networks; Node representation learning; Smoothness;

AB Recent graph neural networks (GNN) has achieved remarkable performance in node representation learning. One key factor of GNN's success is the smoothness property on node representations. Despite this, most GNN models are fragile to the perturbations on graph inputs and could learn unreliable node representations. In this paper, we study how to learn node representations against perturbations in GNN. Specifically, we consider that a node representation should remain stable under slight perturbations on the input, and node representations from different structures should be identifiable, which two are termed as the stability and identifiability on node representations, respectively. To this end, we propose a novel model called Stability-Identifiability GNN Against Perturbations (SIGNNAP) that learns reliable node representations in an unsupervised manner. SIGNNAP formalizes the stability and identifiability by a contrastive objective and preserves the smoothness with existing GNN backbones. The proposed method is a generic framework that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, GraphSage and GAT). Extensive experiments on six benchmarks under both transductive and inductive learning setups of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI MISL: Multi-grained image-text semantic learning for text-guided image

DE Text-guided image inpainting; Textual and visual semantics; Hierarchical
   learning
AB Text-guided image inpainting aims to generate corrupted image patches and obtain a plausible image based on textual descriptions, considering the relationship between textual and visual semantics. Existing works focus on predicting missing patches from the residual pixels of corrupted images, ignoring the visual semantics of the objects of interest in the images corresponding to the textual descriptions. In this paper, we propose a text-guided image inpainting method with multi-grained image-text semantic learning (MISL), consisting of global-local generators and discriminators. More specifically, we devise hierarchical learning (HL) with global -coarse-grained, object-fine-grained, and global-fine-grained learning stages in the global-local generators to refine the corrupted images from the global to local. In particular, the object-fine-grained learning stage focuses on the visual semantics of objects of interest in corrupted images by using an encoder-decoder network with self-attention blocks. Not only that, we design a mask reconstruction (MR) module to further act on the restoration of the objects of interest corresponding to the given textual descriptions. To inject the textual semantics into the global-local generators, we implement a multi-attention (MA) module that incorporates the word-level and sentence-level textual features to generate three different-grained images. For training, we exploit a global discriminator and a flexible discriminator to penalize the whole image and the corrupted region, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show the outperformance of the proposed MISL.

ID DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES; PARTS
AB Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an effective method for image clustering. However, relatively fixed graph regularization terms and loss functions have been adopted by recently proposed variants of NMF, and their clustering performance can be improved by incorporating configurable parameters. In this paper, an auto -adjustable hypergraph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (AHRNMF) algorithm was proposed. In the AHRNMF framework, we proposed a piecewise loss function and an innovative auto-adjustable hypergraph. The loss function incorporates two adaptive parameters, harmonizing reconstruction error and anti-outlier efficacy. Hypergraph construction relies on the calculation of two k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with different scales. Furthermore, an KNN-based algorithm was developed to assist AHRNMF in achieving auto-adjustment, which can automatically detect outliers without determining the number of clusters in advance. It was demonstrated by extensive experiments that the proposed AHRNMF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

DE Person re-identification; Unsupervised learning; Hard sample generation
AB Unsupervised Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth labels. Most existing methods address this problem by progressively mining high-confidence pseudo labels to guide the feature learning process. However, how to construct hard-enough samples while maintaining the fidelity of pseudo labels in these samples remains an open issue in the machine learning community. To tackle this challenge, we design a simple yet effective adversarial contrastive feature learning (ACFL) framework, which enhances the discriminative capability of features by introducing more transformed hard samples in the feature learning process. Specifically, it mainly consists of a discriminative feature learning module and a hard sample generation module. The discriminative feature learning module extracts recognizable features of unlabeled training samples to estimate the high-confidence relationship between samples. Then, the hard sample generation module utilizes these high-confidence relationships between samples to transfer all samples into the hard ones via an adversarial learning strategy. Finally, the generated hard samples are further fed into DFL to learn discriminative features for person Re-ID. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 datasets show that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.

TI LCReg: Long-tailed image classification with Latent Categories based
   Recognition
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
LA English
DT Article
DE Long-tailed; Image classification; Latent Categories
AB In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of long-tailed image recognition. Previous long-tailed recognition approaches mainly focus on data augmentation or re-balancing strategies for the tail classes to give them more attention during model training. However, these methods are limited by the small number of training images for the tail classes, which results in poor feature representations. To address this issue, we propose the Latent Categories based long-tail Recognition (LCReg) method. Our hypothesis is that common latent features shared by head and tail classes can be used to improve feature representation. Specifically, we learn a set of class-agnostic latent features shared by both head and tail classes, and then use semantic data augmentation on the latent features to implicitly increase the diversity of the training sample. We conduct extensive experiments on five long-tailed image recognition datasets, and the results show that our proposed method significantly improves the baselines.

AB Class imbalance problem commonly exists in multi-label classification (MLC) tasks. It has non-negligible im-pacts on the classifier performance and has drawn extensive attention in recent years. Borderline oversampling has been widely used in single-label learning as a competitive technique in dealing with class imbalance. Nevertheless, the borderline samples in multi-label data sets (MLDs) have not been studied. Hence, this paper deeply discussed the borderline samples in MLDs and found they have different neighboring relationships with class borders, which makes their roles different in the classifier training. For that, they are divided into two types named the self-borderline samples and the cross-borderline samples. Further, a novel MLDs resampling approach called Multi-Label Borderline Oversampling Technique (MLBOTE) is proposed for multi -label imbalanced learning. MLBOTE identifies three types of seed samples, including interior, self-borderline, and cross-borderline samples, and different oversampling mechanisms are designed for them, respectively. Meanwhile, it regards not only the minority classes but also the classes suffering from one-vs-rest imbalance as those in need of oversampling. Experiments on eight data sets with nine MLC algorithms and three base classifiers are carried out to compare MLBOTE with some state-of-art MLDs resampling techniques. The results show MLBOTE outperforms other methods in various scenarios.

AB Semantic processing is a fundamental research domain in computational linguistics. In the era of powerful pre-trained language models and large language models, the advancement of research in this domain appears to be decelerating. However, the study of semantics is multi-dimensional in linguistics. The research depth and breadth of computational semantic processing can be largely improved with new technologies. In this survey, we analyzed five semantic processing tasks, e.g., word sense disambiguation, anaphora resolution, named entity recognition, concept extraction, and subjectivity detection. We study relevant theoretical research in these fields, advanced methods, and downstream applications. We connect the surveyed tasks with downstream applications because this may inspire future scholars to fuse these low-level semantic processing tasks with high-level natural language processing tasks. The review of theoretical research may also inspire new tasks and technologies in the semantic processing domain. Finally, we compare the different semantic processing techniques and summarize their technical trends, application trends, and future directions.

AB Online hashing technology has attracted extensive attention owing to its effectiveness and efficiency in processing large-scale streaming data. However, there are still some limitations: (1) In practical applications, the observed labels of multimedia data are obtained through manual annotation, which may inevitably introduce some noises into labels. This may lead to retrieval performance degradation when the noisy labels are directly applied to retrieval tasks. (2) The potential semantic correlation of multi-labels cannot be fully explored. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose robust online hashing with label semantic enhancement (ROHLSE). Specifically, ROHLSE seeks to recover the clean labels from the provided noisy labels by imposing low-rank and sparse constraints. Meanwhile, it employs the representation of samples in the feature space to predict the labels via the dependency between sample instances and labels. To efficiently handle streaming data, ROHLSE preserves the similarity between new data, and establishes the semantic relationships between new and old data through chunk similarity, simultaneously. Furthermore, ROHLSE can fully utilize the semantic correlations between multiple labels of each instance. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ROHLSE approach.

TI Prompt-based and weak-modality enhanced multimodal recommendation
SO INFORMATION FUSION

DT Article
DE Multimodal recommendation; Multimodal interest learning; Prompt learning
AB Beyond conventional recommendation systems that rely merely on user-item interaction data, multimodal recommendation systems additionally exploit the item multimodal data for boosting the recommendation performance. In this research line, late fusion-based approaches that first predict user ratings for each item modality independently and then merge these predictions for a final user rating have made significant advancements. Nevertheless, these methods still have the following two issues: (1) they utilize individual user embeddings to model user interest in different modalities, while overlooking the underlying relationship among modalities and significantly increasing the memory costs; and (2) they overlook the unreliable interest learned from certain modality, thus hindering the accurate final rating learning. To address these issues, we propose a prompt-based and weak-modality enhanced multimodal recommendation framework. It consists of two key components: (1) multimodal prompted user interest learning that adopts a single user embedding with different modality prompts to model different modality-specific user interests, and (2) weak-modality enhanced training that enhances the user interest learning in modalities where the predictions are less unreliable, ensuring well-balanced learning across all modalities. Extensive experiments on Amazon datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The two components deployed onto existing methods help to make them more effective and efficient.

ID TRACKING
AB The localization of the camera is essential in AR, MR, and robotics. Diverse pipelines employ a hand-crafted or learning based way to predict the camera pose as per the task. In the localization process, both weaknesses and strengths are maintained. However, few current frameworks consider these two features simultaneously. In this study, a novel relocalization pipeline for RGB or RGB-D input is proposed, including a coarse stage with learned features, further refinement with hand-crafted features, and a stable process to measure the confidence of both stages for improving localization robustness. Instead of directly regressing the camera pose, the coarse procedure uses registration to the known source and predicted weighted target point cloud to obtain the initial result. Therefore, we design a deep network called PGNet to construct the weighted target point cloud with the image and previous poses as inputs. Moreover, in consideration of dynamic surroundings, we add a segmentation branch distinguishing each point as either fixed or dynamic with the purpose of promoting dynamic perception. Correspondingly, the segmentation-extended Chamfer Distance is added to optimize PGNet. During the pose refinement, the feature space is established via hand-crafted feature extraction and matching on the training set. Based on the coarse pose, we obtain the accurate pose by applying Kabsch or Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to point-to-point correspondences built through searching the space and matching Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief (ORB) features. Furthermore, an additional process is presented by defining coarse and refinement metrics to gain a more stable performance. Finally, experiments on both static and dynamic scenes are conducted. On the one side, the results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance over other existing methods on 7 Scenes, INDOOR-6, Cambridge Landmarks and TUM RGB-D. On the other side, the positive effects of the pose learning part, dynamic branch, confidence regression and hand-crafted feature based refinement are also provided.

AB The performance discrepancies caused by different implementation details may obscure the actual progress of the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task. In this paper, we construct a SALient Object Detection (SALOD) benchmark to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation by unifying the implementation details of SOD methods. By doing so, we can reveal the reasons behind recent progress by analyzing the impact of network structure and optimization strategy. Based on the experimental results, we first find that U-shaped networks, both older and more recent variants, achieve better performance than other structures. Second, optimization strategy, e.g., training strategy and loss function, significantly impacts SOD accuracy. Finally, we provide a new perspective to validate the generalizability of SOD methods on objectness shifting. Code is available at https://github.com/moothes/SALOD.

AB Due to recent technical improvements, the smart grid has become a feasible platform for electricity market participants to successfully regulate their bidding process based on demand-side management (DSM) perspectives. At this level, practical design, implementation, and assessment of numerous demand response mechanisms and robust short-term price forecasting development in day-ahead transactions are all critical. The accuracy and effectiveness of the day-ahead price forecasting process are crucial concerns in a deregulated market. In this market, the reason for low accuracy is the limitation of electricity generation compared to the electricity demand variations. Hence, this study proposes a suitable technique for forecasting electricity prices using a multi-head self-attention and Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) based approach. Further, this study develops a feature selection technique using mutual information (MI) and neural networks (NN) to choose suitable input variable subsets significantly affecting electricity price predictions simultaneously. The combination of MI and NN reduces the number of input features used in the model, thereby decreasing the computational complexity of the NN. The actual data sets from the Ontario electricity market in 2020 are acquired to verify the simulation results. Finally, the simulation results proved the efficiency of the proposed method by demonstrating increased accuracy by attaining the lowest average value for MAPE and RMSE with a value of 1.75% and 0.0085, respectively, and compared to results obtained by recent computational intelligence approaches. By attaining accurate electricity price results, the significance of this study can be summed up as aiding the electricity industry's operators in administering effective energy management, efficient resource allocation, and informed decision-making.

AB With the increasing demand for Chinese cold chain logistics, accurate forecasting becomes significantly important for decision-making and planning, but the data scarcity is still a challenging problem for modeling method. This paper proposes a novel grey prediction model with bi-level structure to improve the performance of cold chain logistics demand forecasting. The model adapts to the data characteristics and generates corresponding background series to adjust the parameters. A differential evolutionary algorithm is employed to merge the time response functions generated from the bi-level structure. The proposed model extends the applicability compared with existing similar models and can provide higher accuracy for data sequences with a high developing rate. The model outperforms the classic grey model and its extensions in terms of forecasting accuracy. The trend of Chinese cold chain logistics demand from 2021 to 2025 is studied with the proposed model. The computational results show that the proposed grey prediction model is significantly better than other models.

AB Pansharpening refers to fusing a low-resolution multispectral image (LRMS) and a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Traditional pansharpening methods use a single pair of LRMS and PAN to generate HRMS at full resolution, but they fail to generate high-quality fused products due to the assumption of a (often inaccurate) linear relationship between the fused products. Convolutional neural network methods, i.e., supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, can model any arbitrary non-linear relationship among data, but performing even worse than traditional methods when testing data are not consistent with training data. Moreover, supervised methods rely on simulating reduced resolution data for training causing information loss at full resolution. Unsupervised pansharpening suffers from distortion due to the lack of reference images and inaccuracy in the estimation of the degradation process. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot semi-supervised method for pansharpening (ZS-Pan), which only requires a single pair of PAN/LRMS images for training and testing networks combining both the pros of supervised and unsupervised methods. Facing with challenges of limited training data and no reference images, the ZS-Pan framework is built with a two-phase three-component model, i.e., the reduced resolution supervised pre-training (RSP), the spatial degradation establishment (SDE), and the full resolution unsupervised generation (FUG) stages. Specifically, a special parameter initialization technique, a data augmentation strategy, and a non-linear degradation network are proposed to improve the representation ability of the network. In our experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on different datasets using some state-of-the-art (SOTA) pansharpening approaches for comparison. Results show that our ZS-Pan outperforms these SOTA methods, both visually and quantitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/coder-qicao/ZS-Pan.

ID GASTRIC POLYPS
AB Gastric polyps are an important cause of gastric disease. At present, the computer-aided diagnosis technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) can automatically locate the position of polyps from the gastroscopic image, which improves the efficiency of doctors. However, due to the small polyp area in the gastroscopic image, the CNN-based method has a high rate of missed detection. To solve the above problems, in this work, we propose a reconstruction and convolution operations enabled variant vision transformer (RCVViT) to automatically locate the position of polyps in gastroscopic images. The RCVViT model uses the vision transformer model as a benchmark model. By using the self-attention mechanism, contextual information can be considered, and irregularly shaped polyps or polyps with small areas can be effectively detected. The feedforward neural network (FNN) and CNN are used to flatten each image patch data into a one-dimensional vector. The advantage of combining the FNN and CNN is that the local feature information and structural information of the polyp area are considered. In addition, we use an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform to collect and analyze patients' medical data to make timely diagnosis of patients' diseases. Finally, our multiple experimental results on real gastroscopic datasets demonstrate the superiority of the RCVViT model.

AB A computer-aided diagnosis system is a popular tool to predict the risk factors of brain tumors. However, the existing techniques are unable to provide high detection accuracy due to the inability of capturing the hidden features of brain tumors. In this view, the present work decomposes the MR modality images into different layers using non-sub-sampled shearlet transformation (NSST). Following this, the proposed detection pipeline employs adaptive pulse-coupled neural network (A-PCNN) module and a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm for enhancement and segmentation of suspicious regions respectively. Interlayer textural relationships of tumors are estimated in terms of the layer-wise difference of the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), similarity indices, and entropy distributions. Thenceforth, those feature coefficients are coded with binary sequences to express the textural homogeneity/randomness of tumors. Finally, these handcrafted multi-scale feature quantifiers are fed to some standard classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique, the linear square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and the decision tree (DT) for discriminating the state of benignancy/malignancy of tumors. Experimental results ensure that the proposed detection model shows superior performance compared to existing methods.

AB To utilize both labeled data and unlabeled data in real-world applications, semi-supervised learning is widely used as an effective technique. However, most semi-supervised methods do not perform well when there are many noises and redundant information in the original data. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a novel approach called robust embedding regression (RER) for semi-supervised learning by inheriting the advantages of the existing semi-supervised learning, robust linear regression, and low-rank representation techniques. Specifically, RER constructs a more robust and accurate graph by adaptively arranging the weight coefficient for each data point. Furthermore, the low-rank representation is introduced to reduce the negative influence of the redundant features and noises residing in the original data while the graph construction. More importantly, the proper norms are imposed on both the reconstruction and regularization terms to further improve the robustness and earn feature/sample selection. We designed an effective iterative algorithm to optimize the problem of RER. Comprehensive experimental results conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that RER is superior in classification and clustering performance and robust to different types of noise compared with the existing semi-supervised methods.

AB Signature verification is a frequently-used forensics technology in numerous safety-critical situations. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant advancements in the field of signature verification, their reliance on local neighborhood operations poses limitations in capturing the global contextual relationships among signature strokes. To overcome this weakness, in this paper, we propose a novel holistic-part unified model named TransOSV based on the vision transformer framework to solve offline signature verification problem. The signature images are first encoded into patch sequences by the proposed transformer-based holistic encoder to learn the global signature representation. Second, considering the subtle local difference between the genuine signature and forged signature, we design a contrast based part decoder along with a sparsity loss, which are utilized to learn the discriminative part features. With the learned holistic features and part features, the proposed model is optimized by the contrast loss function. To reduce the influence of sample imbalance, we also formulate a new focal contrast loss function. Furthermore, we conduct the proposed model to learn signature representations for writer-dependent signature verification task. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed TransOSV model for both writer-independent and writer-dependent signature verification tasks, achieving remarkable performance improvements and competitive results on four widely-used offline signature datasets.

AB The clinical diagnosis decision-making process of integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine is essentially a type of group decision-making (GDM) problem, which is transparently characterized by the multiformity of data types and the diversity of knowledge structures among experts. However, most existing GDM methods are designed based on single data types and cannot address GDM problems involving multiple data types and diversified attributes. Moreover, the preference-approval structure provides a simple framework to simulate the preference information regarding an individual's ranking and approval. But it only considers two categories: approval and disapproval, without accounting for the indecision of individuals. In reality, three-way decision (TWD) is common. Given the deficiencies above, this paper puts forward a novel preference-approval structure-based three-way group consensus decision-making approach for a class of GDM problems with the characteristics of incompleteness, multi-granularity, diversity, and compound. To represent the information in these complex GDM problems, we firstly present the concept of incomplete multi-granularity diversified compound decision systems (IMGDCDSs). Secondly, according to the data characteristics, we construct a non-additive TWD model over the framework of granular computing. On the one hand, using the reference point of each attribute, an acquisition method of relative loss functions is given by considering three kinds of states. On the other hand, we present a new fuzzy measure to calculate non-additive conditional probabilities. The above work enriches the existing TWD theory. Based on the three-way classification and ranking results obtained, this paper subsequently defines a preference-approval structure and establishes a new group consensus decision-making approach. Thereby, the TWD model is integrated into preference-approval structures, which further enriches the GDM theory. More importantly, some existing group consensus methods are special cases of our study. Whereafter, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using an illustrative example. Finally, the stability and effectiveness of the approach are verified through an empirical study in the context of medical diagnosis.

AB Emotion modeling has always been intriguing to researchers, where detecting emotion is highly focused and generating emotion is much less focused to date. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to exploring emotion generation, particularly for general-purpose conversations. Based on the Cognitive Appraisal Theory and focusing on audio and textual inputs, we propose a novel method to calculate informative variables to evaluate a particular emotion-generating event and six primary emotions. Incorporating such a method of artificial emotion generation, we implement an emotional chatbot, namely EmoBot. Accordingly, EmoBot analyzes continuous audio and textual inputs, calculates the informative variables to evaluate the current situation, generates appropriate emotions, and responds accordingly. An objective evaluation indicates that EmoBot could generate more accurate emotional and semantic responses than a traditional chatbot that does not consider emotion. Additionally, a subjective evaluation of EmoBot demonstrates the appreciation of users for EmoBot over a traditional chatbot that does not consider emotion.

AB Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a combination of sensors, healthcare devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) to deliver better and intelligent healthcare services. However, security and privacy protection issues have hindered its wide integration resulting in lack of quality IoMT dataset. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning method that can be helpful for IoMT networks and smart healthcare systems (SHS) due to enhanced security and privacy. The use of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has become vital for contemporary critical networks to protect against evolving cyber-attacks. Existing security models are often challenging and computationally expensive to apply to resource-limited medical IoT devices. To this end, this research work proposes a privacy-preserving FL-based IDS model named Fed-Inforce-Fusion to identify cyber-attacks from IoMT networks. Specifically, the proposed Fed-Inforce-Fusion model uses reinforcement learning technique to learn the latent relationships of medical data. Next, a FL-based system is designed allowing distributed SHS nodes to collaboratively train a comprehensive IDS model in a privacy preserving manner. Then, a fusion/aggregation strategy is adopted to improve the performance of detection model and reduce communication overhead by allowing participating clients to involve in the federation process dynamically. Theoretical study and experiment analysis show that the proposed Fed-Inforce-Fusion is better and effective in detecting complex attack vectors in comparison to existing benchmark IDS methods. Thus, proposing its efficacy and suitability in real-world IoMT networks.

TI Sparse self-attention transformer for image inpainting
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Image inpainting; Transformer; Sparse attention; Channel attention
AB Learning-based image inpainting methods have made remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from issues such as blurring, artifacts, and inconsistent contents. The use of vanilla convolution kernels, which have limited perceptual fields and spatially invariant kernel coefficients, is one of the main causes for these problems. In contrast, the multi-headed attention in the transformer can effectively model non-local relations among input features by generating adaptive attention scores. Therefore, this paper explores the feasibility of employing the transformer model for the image inpainting task. However, the multiheaded attention transformer blocks pose a significant challenge due to their overwhelming computational cost. To address this issue, we propose a novel U-Net style transformer-based network for the inpainting task, called the sparse self-attention transformer (Spa-former). The Spa-former retains the long-range modeling capacity of transformer blocks while reducing the computational burden. It incorporates a new channel attention approximation algorithm that reduces attention calculation to linear complexity. Additionally, it replaces the canonical softmax function with the ReLU function to generate a sparse attention map that effectively excludes irrelevant features. As a result, the Spa-former achieves effective long-range feature modeling with fewer parameters and lower computational resources. Our empirical results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Spa-former over state-of-the-art approaches.

DE Video captioning; Feature aggregation; Semantic enhancement
AB Video captioning aims to briefly describe the content of a video in accurate and fluent natural language, which is a hot research topic in multimedia processing. As a bridge between video and natural language, video captioning is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of video content and effective utilization of diverse video multimodal information. Existing video captioning methods usually ignore the relative importance between different frames when aggregating frame-level video features and neglect the global semantic correlations between videos and texts in learning visual representations, resulting in the learned representations less effective. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework, namely Global Semantic Enhancement Network (GSEN) to generate high-quality captions for videos. Specifically, a feature aggregation module based on a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to aggregate frame -level video features, which highlights features of informative frames in video representations. In addition, a global semantic enhancement module is proposed to enhance semantic correlations for video and language representations in order to generate semantically more accurate captions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public benchmark datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that the proposed GSEN can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art methods.

AB The multi-class classification task is one of the most common tasks in machine learning. As a typical solution based on a partitioning strategy, Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) can transform a multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problems. The key of ECOC is to construct an effective codematrix to represent a set of class decomposition schemes, which transforms a multiclass problem into a group of binary class problems. Consequently, the design of a fast and effective ECOC codematrix generation method is of great research significance and value for solving multi-class classification problems. In ECOC algorithms, the design of codematrix is treated as a combination problem between different code columns, in which the evolutionary algorithm shows a great advantage. Based on this consideration, the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is applied to search for the codematrix with high performance because its expressive tree structure makes it well represent codematrcies for subsequent optimization operations. This paper proposes an adaptive ECOC algorithm based on Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and similarity measurement matrix, named GEP-ECOC. In our GEP, each individual represents a set of columns to form a random ECOC codematrix, which is optimized in the evolutionary process. Meanwhile, the crossover and mutation operations are modified to include a legality checking process to ensure that the generated codematrix satisfies the ECOC constraints. The GEP-based ECOC codematrix generation algorithm can quickly produce a codematrix with better performance, which ensures the efficiency of the algorithm to a certain extent. In addition, an adaptive algorithm based on a similarity measurement matrix is proposed to add new columns to the current codematrix, aiming to better handle hard classes. Our algorithm is compared with other algorithms on various data sets, and the experimental results confirm that our GEP-ECOC can balance the efficiency and performance of the algorithm and achieve higher performance.

In this paper, finger skin and finger vein images are acquired from the same region of the finger and therefore have a higher correlation. To represent data efficiently, we propose a novel Finger Disentangled Representation Learning Framework (FDRL-Net) that is based on a factorization concept, which disentangles each modality into shared and private features, thereby improving complementarity for better fusion and extracting modality-invariant features for heterogeneous recognition. Besides, to capture as much finger texture as possible, we utilize three-view finger images to reconstruct full-view multi-spectral finger traits, which increases the identity information and the robustness to finger posture variation. Finally, a Boat-Trackers-based multi-task distillation method is proposed to migrate the feature representation ability to a lightweight multi-task network. Extensive experiments on six single-view multi-spectral finger datasets and two full-view multi-spectral finger datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

   Multi-scale feature fusion; Knowledge transfer
AB Long-tailed learning is attracting increasing attention due to the unbalanced distributions of real-world data. The aim is to train well-performing depth models. Traditional knowledge transfer methods for longtailed learning are classified into feature-based horizontal knowledge transfer (HKT) and class-based vertical knowledge transfer (VKT). HKT transfers head-to-tail feature knowledge from different classes to improve classification performance when there are few tail classes. However, HKT easily leads to invalid transfer due to the deviation caused by the difference between the knowledge of head and tail classes. Fortunately, the class space has a multi-grained relationship and can form a multi-granularity knowledge graph (MGKG), which can be recast as coarse-grained and fine-grained losses to guide VKT. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical longtailed classification method based on multi-granularity knowledge transfer (MGKT), which vertically transfers knowledge from coarse-to fine-grained classes. First, we exploit the semantic information of classes to construct an MGKG, which forms an affiliation of fine-and coarse-grained classes. Fine-grained knowledge can inherit coarse-grained knowledge to reduce transfer bias with the help of MGKG. We then propose a multi-scale feature fusion network, which aims to fully mine the rich information of the features to drive MGKT. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in classifying long-tailed data. For example, our model performed 4.46% better than the next-best model on the SUN-LT dataset.

AB People segment complex, ever-changing, and continuous experience into basic, stable, and discrete spatiotemporal experience units, called events. The literature on event segmentation investigates the mechanisms behind this ability. Event segmentation theory points out that people predict ongoing activities and observe prediction error signals to find event boundaries. In this study, we investigated the mechanism giving rise to this ability through a computational model and accompanying psychological experiments. Inspired by event segmentation theory and predictive processing, we introduced a self-supervised model of event segmentation. This model consists of neural networks that predict the sensory signal in the next time-step to represent different events, and a cognitive model that regulates these networks on the basis of their prediction errors. In order to verify the ability of our model in segmenting events, learning them during passive observation, and representing them in its representational space, we prepared a video of human behaviors represented by point-light displays. We compared the event segmentation behaviors of participants and our model with this video in two granularities. Using point-biserial correlation, we demonstrated that the event boundaries of our model correlated with the responses of the participants. Moreover, by approximating the representation space of participants, we showed that our model formed a similar representation space with those of participants. The result suggests that our model that tracks the prediction error signals can produce human-like event boundaries and event representations. Finally, we discuss our contribution to the literature and our understanding of how event segmentation is implemented in the brain.

AB In geographically distributed infrastructures, Preventive Maintenance (PM) plays an important role since it improves the serviceability of components. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the scheduling and routing problems associated with the PM of elevator repair service companies. The article presents two mathematical models and considers the objective function of increasing customer satisfaction with regard to the timely presence of PM teams as one of its significant contributions. The chance-constrained approach was also used to formulate the model in uncertain circumstances. Additionally, random data sets were used to measure the accuracy and performance of the presented models. As a solution approach to the problem in large instances, we developed the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm. As a result of analyzing the sensitivity of the models, we are able to determine the effects of inputs on the objective function and solution time. By increasing the bounds of the time window in the sensitivity analysis, the trial values were compared. Based on the results, increases in the earliest arrival time led to increases in the objective function, whereas increases in the latest arrival time led to reductions of the penalty and objective function. It was also possible to significantly reduce the solution time by adding symmetry-breaking constraints. An analysis of VNS was conducted in comparison with a model based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). The developed VNS outperforms the MIP for a variety of scale problems and maintenance team sizes.

AB In this paper we propose a new version of penalty-based aggregation functions, the Multi Cost Aggregation choosing functions (MCAs), in which the function to minimize is constructed using a convex combination of two relaxed versions of restricted equivalence and dissimilarity functions instead of a penalty function. We additionally suggest two different alternatives to train a MCA in a supervised classification task in order to adapt the aggregation to each vector of inputs. We apply the proposed MCA in a Motor Imagery-based Brain- Computer Interface (MI-BCI) system to improve its decision making phase. We also evaluate the classical aggregation with our new aggregation procedure in two publicly available datasets. We obtain an accuracy of 82.31% for a left vs. right hand in the Clinical BCI challenge (CBCIC) dataset, and a performance of 62.43% for the four-class case in the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset compared to a 82.15% and 60.56% using the arithmetic mean. Finally, we have also tested the goodness of our proposal against other MI-BCI systems, obtaining better results than those using other decision making schemes and Deep Learning on the same datasets.

AB Scanning electron micrographs of solid materials are a source of analysis for hardness, defects, etc. A micrograph is a two-dimensional image of a material being cut. Typical photomicrographs contain about a hundred thousand structural elements, such as grain boundaries, boundary junctions, etc., which are not easy to analyze with the naked eye. Currently, computer vision can be used to analyze the geometric properties of structural elements. One of the important properties is the cross section of the grain, which is the result of cutting the material. In the article we turn to one of the geometric properties of random grain cuttings. The statistical properties of the cross sections of grains in an alloy are equivalent to the statistical properties of the cross sections of individual grains by random planes if the grains do not touch each other. We present two stages of mathematical analysis of the grain cross-sections. First, using the algorithm for generating random planes with a uniform distribution, a method is proposed for generating random sections of polyhedra. The method can be useful in stochastic geometry and computational geometry, as well as in materials science. Second, sections of polyhedra with random planes are considered, and a numerical algorithm for estimating the distribution density of angles of convex polyhedra is also implemented. Examples of distribution densities in random sections for a cube, a regular triangular prism, and a truncated prism are given. The developed algorithm and the obtained distribution densities are of practical use in the analysis of micrographs of thin sections of crystalline alloys.

AB Malware is still a challenging security problem in the Android ecosystem, as malware is often obfuscated to evade detection. In such case, semantic behavior feature extraction is crucial for training a robust malware detection model. In this paper, we propose a novel Android malware detection method (named SeGDroid) that focuses on learning the semantic knowledge from sensitive function call graphs (FCGs). Specifically, we devise a graph pruning method to build a sensitive FCG on the base of an original FCG. The method preserves the sensitive API (security-related API) call context and removes the irrelevant nodes of FCGs. We propose a node representation method based on word2vec and social-network-based centrality to extract attributes for graph nodes. Our representation aims at extracting the semantic knowledge of the function calls and the structure of graphs. Using this representation, we induce graph embeddings of the sensitive FCGs associated with node attributes using a graph convolutional neural network algorithm. To provide a model explanation, we further propose a method that calculates node importance. This creates a mechanism for understanding malicious behavior. The experimental results show that SeGDroid achieves an F-score of 98% in the case of malware detection on the CICMal2020 dataset and an F-score of 96% in the case of malware family classification on the MalRadar dataset. In addition, the provided model explanation is able to trace the malicious behavior of the Android malware.

AB This paper introduces a novel concept for Home-based Monitoring (HM) that enables robust analysis and understanding of activities towards improved caring and safety. Spatio-Temporal Visual Learning for HM (STVL-HM) is a novel method that learns from sensor data that is jointly represented in space and time in order to robustify the HM process. We propose a hybrid model based on a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Transformers. The CNN first learns the visual spatial features from various sensor data. The learned visual features are then fed into the transformer, which captures temporal information by observing the sensor status at various timestamps. STVL-HM has been tested using Kinetics-400, the real use case of human activity recognition scenario for HM data. The results reveal the clear superiority of the STVL-HM compared to the recent baseline HM solutions.

AB Due to the extremely limited prior knowledge, machinery fault diagnosis under varying working conditions with limited annotation data is a very challenging task in practical industrial scenarios. To solve this issue, a multi-sensor data fusion-enabled semi-supervised optimal temperature-guided prototypical contrastive learning (OTPCL) framework is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under varying working conditions with limited annotation data. First, a multi-sensor data adaptive weighting strategy (MSAWS) is built to reintegrate the multi-sensor data by adaptively learning the important information of different sensor data and assigning the corresponding weights. Then, an OTPCL method is proposed to reduce the domain shift between the source and target domains, where the vital parameter named the temperature coefficient are adaptively optimized for enhancing the ability of discriminant domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework is constructed by combining the MSAWS, the OTPCL and a domain-shared classifier for machinery fault diagnosis. In two experimental analyses on machinery varying working conditions with limited annotation data, the superiority of the proposed MSAWS is validated by respectively using our fused multi sensor data and different original single-sensor data for the SSL framework. The proposed method obviously outperforms the five advanced domain adaptation methods including CORAL, MMD, CMMD, JDA and PCL.

AB Due to the urgent nature of emergency decision making, it is necessary to reach the consensus requirement quickly. Ordinal consensus measure explores the relation between the rankings and helps to intuitively know which alternative needs to be adjusted to accelerate the improvement of consensus. Moreover, decision makers (DMs) in the decision making problem are often connected through trust relationships which affect the DMs' judgments in the process of DMs' interaction. Therefore, this paper explores trust network-based group decision-making in which the consensus level is estimated by an ordinal consensus measure. We first focus on the supplementation of an incomplete trust network. One of the most common methods is to design the trust propagation operator, whereas the intensity of information propagation may be different in various scenarios. Therefore, considering the different numerical scale of the linguistic term set, a trust propagation operator with different intensity of trust propagation is designed to obtain the indirect trust relationship. In the process of supplementing the incomplete trust network, the contribution of DMs to propagating information is concerned, which can be described by the betweenness centrality, and the importance weights of DMs are determined by combining the betweenness centrality and trust in-degree. In the consensus reaching process, we first propose an improved ordinal consensus measure, which takes into account the consistency of orders of the same alternative in different rankings as well as the importance of positions of alternatives. Then, we design the identification rule and the feedback mechanism for those with low consensus levels. The identification rule used to select the DMs which first few alternatives in the ranking are different with those in the ranking of group. And in the feedback mechanism, the referenced preference relation (FPR) obtained by the trust network is provided for the identified DMs. Afterwards, combining the referenced FPR, an optimization model designed to give the adjustment opinion. Finally, a numerical example elaborates on the feasibility of the trust propagation operator and consensus model. The comparative analysis demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB In this paper, an enhanced disentanglement module is proposed to address feature misalignment caused by inherently irreconcilable conflicts between classification and regression tasks in Convolutional Neural Network based object detectors. The proposed method disentangles features in the feature pyramid network (FPN) at the neck of the architecture. In addition, a response alignment strategy is proposed to reduce inconsistent responses and suppress inferior predictions. Extensive experiments are performed on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with different backbones, confirming that the proposed method improves performance significantly. The proposed method exhibits two main advantages over existing solutions-features are disentangled at the neck instead of at the head, enabling comprehensive resolution of feature misalignment, and independent outputs of the two tasks after feature disentanglement are avoided, thereby preventing response inconsistencies.

AB With the ongoing digitization of the manufacturing industry and the ability to bring together data from specific manufacturing processes, there is enormous potential to use machine learning (ML) techniques to improve such processes. In this context, the competitive automotive industry can take advantage of the ML power by predicting defects before they occur, aiming to reduce the scrap rate and increase the robustness and reliability of the production processes. In a real world scenario, small and medium size companies do not have the amount of data the big companies have, which can prevent the usage of ML models in this vital niche for the industry. A collaboration in terms of data usage to develop powerful and general industry solutions is hindered by data privacy concerns despite similar problems. This paper addresses these concerns by providing a framework based on the Federated Learning (FL) method combined with Digital Envelopes (DE) to allow the ML models training while keeping the data of the partners and the models parameters private and protected against external cyber-attacks, which is one of the weaknesses of FL as of now. A case study was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on handling data poisoning attacks to the training data and also the models' weights.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Multi-view subspace clustering (MVSC) has acquired satisfactory clustering performance since it effectively integrates the information from multiple views. However, existing MVSC methods often suffer from high time costs and are difficult to be used in real-life large-scale data. Anchor-based MVSC methods have been presented to select crucial landmarks to reduce time-consuming effectively. In addition, the processes of anchor selection of existing methods are performed in the raw space, in which the high-dimensional data often involve lots of noise information and outliers that inevitably lead to the degradation of clustering performance. Moreover, these methods also ignore the balance structure of data, such that the selected anchors cannot fully characterize the intrinsic structure information of the original data. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we present a novel MVSC method named Fast Multi-view Subspace Clustering with Balance Anchors Guidance (FMVSC-BAG). Specifically, FMVSC-BAG integrates the learning processes of anchors, anchor graphs, and labels into a united framework in embedding space seamlessly. This way, they can reinforce each other to improve final clustering performance while eliminating noise and outliers hidden in the original data. Furthermore, FMVSC-BAG constrains the learned labels to preserve the balance structure by a novel balance strategy to promote further that the intrinsic balance structure information of original data can be reserved in the learned anchors and anchor graph. Finally, extensive experiments on eight real-life large-scale datasets prove its efficiency and superiority compared to some advanced clustering methods.

AB With excellent global approximation performance and interpretability, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems have enjoyed a wide range of applications in various fields, such as smart control, medical, and finance. However, in handling high-dimensional complex data, the performance and interpretability of a single TSK fuzzy system are easily degraded by rule explosion due to the curse of dimensionality. Ensemble learning comes into play to deal with the problem by the fusion of multiple TSK fuzzy systems using appropriate ensemble learning strategies, which has shown to be effective in eliminating the issue of the curse of dimensionality curse problem and reducing the number of fuzzy rules, thereby maintaining the interpretability of fuzzy systems. To this end, this paper gives a comprehensive survey of TSK fuzzy system fusion to provide insights into further research development. First, we briefly review the fundamental concepts related to TSK fuzzy systems, including fuzzy rule structures, training methods, and interpretability, and discuss the three different development directions of TSK fuzzy systems. Next, along the direction of TSK fuzzy system fusion, we investigate in detail the current ensemble strategies for fusion at hierarchical, wide and stacked levels, and discuss their differences, merits and weaknesses from the aspects of time complexity, interpretability (model complexity) and classification performance. We then present some applications of TSK fuzzy systems in real-world scenarios. Finally, the challenges and future directions of TSK fuzzy system fusion are discussed to foster prospective research.

   network (ANN); Weight optimization
AB Reducing fiber diameter inconsistencies has been the focus of much research in the fiber manufacturing industry. However, the structure of the fiber drawing machine (FDM) leads to time delays in traditional diameter control methods, thereby making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Moreover, traditional methods apply only a single adjustment to control the diameter precision, i.e., drawing velocity, and ignore the crucial impact of furnace temperature on diameter. To address these issues and improve the control precision, we propose a novel hybrid diameter control model that uses an artificial neural network (ANN) as the main framework and integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs) and a new mechanism known as selective weight optimization (SWO). Specifically, due to the irreplaceable role of diameter prediction in the control task, we adopt BiGRU to predict fiber wire diameter and utilize the results as a supplemental data input to the control policy network. Due to the high complexity of the input data, the ANN-based network is introduced as the policy network to analyze the inherent relevance of the data and provide two separate control strategies, i.e., drawing velocity adjustment and furnace temperature adjustment. Additionally, a selective weight optimization (SWO) mechanism that combines these two strategies and selectively optimizes the weights is proposed to further improve diameter control precision. The effectiveness of the BiGRU-ANN-SWO is extensively evaluated using four various real-world experiments. Results indicate that the BiGRU-ANN-SWO achieves considerably more precise and robust control of fiber diameter compared with existing approaches.

AB The cultivation of desired grain varieties holds immense significance as about 67% of the world's population is associated with the agriculture sector. Unknowingly sowing the wrong variety of seeds may lead to a colossal waste of effort and money. Furthermore, the growing issue of rice grain adulteration in high-quality rice poses a threat to the trust of rice importers and exporters. While traditional methods are expensive, laborious, and error-prone, Computer Vision provides a good alternative that constitutes a current, advanced technology for image processing and data evaluation that holds tremendous promise and potential. In this research study, five varieties of rice grains including Jehlum Sr-1, Mushkibudji, Sr-2, and Sr-4 were collected from local grain and were used for research analysis. A computer vision system "RiceNet"contingent upon Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) framework has been designed for ameliorating the accuracy of identifying five unique groups of rice grain varieties. Deep Learning (DL) based pre-trained architectures including InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 models were also adopted for classifying five specific groups of rice species. To optimize model parameters and alleviate back-propagation error during training, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate (lr) of 0.00003 has been employed to fine-tune the pre-trained InceptionV3 and ResNetInceptionV2 models. The proposed RiceNet architecture and pre-trained models were also compared with traditional ML approaches of HOG-SVM, SIFT-SVM, HOG-Logistic Regression(HOG-LR), SIFT-Logistic Regression(SIFT-LR), HOG-KNN, and SIFT-KNN for rice grain classification. With these experimentations at hand, it was observed that our proposed model "RiceNet" outperformed other approaches in similar computer vision tasks. The prediction accuracy outcome for the test dataset by HOG-SVM, SIFT-SVM, HOG-LR, SIFT-LR, HOG-KNN, and SIFT-KNN models were 66.0%, 65.33%, 62.67%, 65.0%, 54.0%, and 52.0% respectively. RiceNet, InceptionV3 and ResNetInceptionV2 have the best prediction accuracy of 94%, 84% and 81.333%. The remarkably high success rate of DCNN models makes them highly valuable and can be extended to endorse an integrated grain identification system that can operate in real-world situations.

DE Joint entity and relation extraction; Graph neural network; Transformer;
   Overlapping triplets; Distant supervision
AB Overlap situation where different triplets share entities or relations is a common challenge in joint entity and relation extraction task. On the one hand, there is strong correlation between overlapping triplets. On the other hand, most of the existing large-scale training data come from distant supervision, which introduces incomplete annotations. These practical problems make the information interaction between triplets particularly important. However, there are two problems with the existing methods: (i) the neglect of information interaction between different triplets; (ii) the limited information utilization caused by the specific decoding order. To solve the above problems, we decompose decoding and information interaction. Specifically, entity and relation proposals are obtained by a proposal generator, then a multi-information interaction graph neural network with parallel decoder is proposed to complete the joint extraction task. In this way, the inherent decoding order is broken to achieve the purpose of fully exploiting multi-information interaction across triplets and within triplets. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms previous work, especially in the case of incomplete annotations.

DE Automatic speech recognition; Language models; Recurrent neural
   networks; Confusion networks
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; ADAPTATION
AB Training domain-specific automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems requires a suitable amount of data comprising the target domain. In several scenarios, such as early development stages, privacy-critical applications, or under-resourced languages, only a limited amount of in-domain speech data and an even smaller amount of manual text transcriptions, if any, are available. This motivates the study of ASR language model (LM) training on a limited amount of in-domain speech data. Early works have attempted training of n-gram LMs from ASR N-best lists and lattices but training and adaptation of recurrent neural network (RNN) LMs from ASR transcripts has not received attention. In this work, we study training and adaptation of RNN LMs using alternate, uncertain ASR hypotheses embedded in ASR confusion networks obtained from target domain speech data. We explore different methods for training the RNN LMs to deal with the uncertain input sequences. The first method extends the cross-entropy objective into a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based training loss, the second method formulates a training loss based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the third method performs training on paths sampled from the confusion networks. These methods are applied to limited data setups including telephone and meeting conversation datasets. Performance is evaluated under two settings wherein no manual transcriptions or a small amount of manual transcriptions are available to aid the training. Moreover, a model adaptation setting is also evaluated wherein the RNN LM is pre-trained on an out-of-domain conversational corpus. Overall the sampling method for training RNN LMs on ASR confusion networks performs the best, and results in up to 12% relative reduction in perplexity on the meeting dataset as compared to training on ASR 1-best hypotheses, without any manual transcriptions. However, the perplexity reductions do not translate into equivalent WER reductions. A detailed analysis of the perplexity reductions obtained by the different methods is performed in order to understand this effect.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; HUMAN-DRIVEN; MODEL; FLOW; SYSTEM
AB With the advent and advancement of connected and automated vehicle technologies, it is now possible to control connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flows to reduce traffic oscillations and enhance traffic flow performance. Recently, a control strategy for autonomous vehicles (AVs) named "The Follower Stopper controller" (FS) has been proposed. However, the existing studies for the FS strategy only considered the situation that all CAVs execute the FS strategy individually. And the impact on the mixed traffic flow when CAVs in the mixed traffic flow execute FS strategies as platoons is not investigated. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a control strategy for CAVs that considers the driving behavior of CAVs platoons based on the FS strategy, which allows CAVs to execute the FS strategy as a platoon. Then, a cellular automaton model of mixed traffic flow is developed based on the proposed strategy. Finally, a numerical simulation is conducted to analyze the impacts of the proposed strategy on traffic efficiency, traffic congestion, traffic oscillation, vehicle fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions under different penetration rates (PRs) of CAVs and traffic densities. Moreover, a comparative analysis with the FS strategy was conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy. The result shows that (1) the proposed strategy can effectively mitigate traffic oscillations and reduce congestion. The improvement effect of the proposed control strategy on the mixed traffic flow is significantly affected by the penetration rate of CAVs as well as the traffic density. (2) Compared with the FS strategy, the proposed strategy has better performance in improving traffic efficiency, alleviating traffic oscillations, relieving congestion, and reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under different traffic conditions. (3) The effectiveness of the FS strategy in improving the performance of mixed traffic flow is greatly limited by traffic density. There is a significant marginal utility of the FS strategy in improving traffic flow performance under high traffic density. However, the proposed strategy overcomes the limitations imposed by high traffic densities. The proposed strategy is highly adaptable to diverse traffic densities and can continuously enhance traffic flow performance as the penetration rate of CAVs rises.

   value function; Deep reinforcement learning
AB Reinforcement learning in multi-agent scenarios is essential for real-world applications as it can vividly depict agents' collaborative and competitive behaviors from a perspective closer to reality. However, most existing studies suffer from poor robustness, preventing multi-agent reinforcement learning from practical applications where robustness is the core indicator of system security and stability. In view of this, we propose a novel Bayesian Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning method, named BMARL, which leverages the distributional value function calculated by Bayesian inference to improve the robustness of the model. Specifically, Bayesian linear regression is adopted to estimate a posterior distribution concerning value function parameters, rather than approximating an expectation value for Q-value by point estimation. In this way, the value function is more generalized than previously obtained by point estimation, which is beneficial to the robustness of our model. Meanwhile, we utilize the Gaussian prior knowledge to integrate more prior knowledge while estimating the value function, which improves learning efficiency. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark multi -agent environments comparing with seven state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of BMARL in terms of both robustness and efficiency.

AB We address the problem of estimating the time-to-employment of a jobseeker using survival analysis and oblique predictive clustering tree. Unlike standard survival analysis, oblique predictive clustering tree can handle categorical and continuous data and is capable of modelling non-linear dependences. Treating the censored data as missing data opens the possibility to perform survival analysis by using structured output prediction in semi-supervised multi-target regression setting. The effectiveness of this approach is shown on a real dataset from Public Employment Services in Slovenia, comprising time-to-employment records with jobseekers' personal and professional characteristics. The performances are compared with six state-of-the-art AI methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using semi-supervised oblique predictive clustering tree for survival analysis.

Our approach uses transfer learning from Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLM) with large corpora available to solve problems in languages with fewer resources for the specific task. The proposed methodology comprises four stages: corpora acquisition, the PTLM definition, training strategies, and evaluation. We carried out experiments using Pre-Trained Language Models in English, Italian, and Portuguese (BERT and XLM-R) to verify which best suited the proposed method. We used corpora in English (WH) and Italian (Evalita 2018) as the source language and the OffComBr-2 corpus in Portuguese (the target language). The results of the experiments showed that the proposed methodology is promising: for the OffComBr-2 corpus, the best state-of-the-art result was obtained (F1-measure = 92%).

AB As a river of great strategic significance in China, the ecological governance of the Yellow River is an important issue. As a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem, evaluating the ecological governance of the Yellow River involves many evaluation indexes. To accurately measure the importance of each indicator, this paper applies the best-worst method (BWM) based on linguistic variables to calculate the subjective weights of the indexes. The improved grey relational (IGR) method is proposed to calculate the objective weights. And the two weights are combined using the Uninorm operator to obtain the combination weights of the indexes. To evaluate the problem from multiple perspectives, we apply the MULTIMOORA method to the ecological governance problem. Then we propose the novel Borda method to aggregate the three evaluation results obtained by the MULTIMOORA method and thus construct the MULTIMOORA-Borda method. Based on the above methods, we analyze the evaluation results and provide policy recommendations for ecological governance of the Yellow River Basin.

AB Single image dehazing is a challenging vision task that recovers haze-free images from observed hazy images. Recently, numerous learning-based dehazing methods have been proposed and achieved promising performance. However, most of them suffer from a heavy computation burden, and even worse, they cannot leverage negative-orient supervision information well in the training stage. To address the above issues, we propose a novel dehazing method called Task-related Contrastive Network (TC-Net). For a better trade-off between performance and parameters, we design a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like architecture. It mainly includes two key modules: the feature enhanced module and the attention fusion module, which can improve the feature representation capability of the network and preserve details information, respectively. More importantly, we propose a task-related contrastive learning framework to fully exploit the negative-orient supervision information. To be specific, we utilize various task-specific data augmentation approaches (e.g., blur, sharpening, color, and light enhancement) to generate informative positive samples and hard negative samples, respectively. Furthermore, we employ an efficient and task-friendly feature embedding network, i.e., the encoder of the dehazing pipeline instead of the pre-trained model, to encode augmented samples into the latent space where negative-orient supervision information can be fully leveraged by contrastive constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TC-Net can obtain remarkable performance compared with other state-of-the-art dehazing methods, by extreme PSNR gains of 1.75 dB and 0.52 dB, on SOTS and Dense-Haze datasets, respectively.

AB Pain assessment is essential for pain diagnosis and treatment. Automating the assessment process from pain behaviors could be an alternative to self-report; however, inter-subject and time-dynamic differences in pain behaviors hinder pain recognition as generic patterns. To address this problem, we proposed a neural network method integrating pain sensitivity in personalized feature fusion and dynamic feature attention leveraging the Squeeze-and-Excitation block. Ablation results from our physiological pain data show that dynamic attention effectively improved prediction recall through soft physiological feature selection, and fusing pain sensitivity improved precision, yielding better F1-score together. By testing our trained models with external BioVid Heat Pain data, we observed better adaptivity to a different pain protocol with higher accuracy in time-continuous pain detection than simple neural networks. At last, we found our method outperformed SOTA works using the same public database in pain intensity classification and regression, reaching 84.58% accuracy in high pain detection with model pretraining.

AB This paper focuses on the multi-objective energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem with machine breakdowns. To mitigate the impact of machine breakdowns, a rescheduling strategy is implemented in the scheduling process. In addition to sequencing the operations, the current problem is to determine the appropriate allocation of the machine and the proper speed of the machine to minimize both makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously. A mixed integer linear programming model is established to describe the considered problem. With the aim of effectively solving this problem, a knowledge-driven two stage memetic algorithm (KTMA) is proposed. In the first stage, a hybrid initialization strategy that combines three problem-specific heuristics is applied to generate a high-quality initial population. Then, a knowledge driven variable neighborhood search approach is designed for quickly converging and fully exploiting the solution space of the KTMA. In the second stage, two energy-saving strategies are designed to further reduce the total energy consumption. Extensive experiments carried out to compare the KTMA with some well-known algorithms confirm that the proposed KTMA can efficiently solve this problem.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) with uncertain missing modalities poses a new challenge in sentiment analysis. To address this problem, efficient MSA models that consider missing modalities have been proposed. However, existing studies have only adopted the concatenation operation for feature fusion while ignoring the deep interactions between different modalities. Moreover, existing studies have failed to take advantage of the text modality, which can achieve better accuracy in sentiment analysis. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, we propose a modality translation-based MSA model (MTMSA), which is robust to uncertain missing modalities. First, for multimodal data (text, visual, and audio) with uncertain missing data, the visual and audio are translated to the text modality with a modality translation module, and then the translated visual modality, translated audio, and encoded text are fused into missing joint features (MJFs). Next, the MJFs are encoded by the transformer encoder module under the supervision of a pre-trained model (transformer-based modality translation network, TMTN), thus making the transformer encoder module produce joint features of uncertain missing modalities approximating those of complete modalities. The encoded MJFs are input into the transformer decoder module to learn the long-term dependencies between different modalities. Finally, sentiment classification is performed based on the outputs of the transformer encoder module. Extensive experiments were conducted on two popular benchmark datasets (CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP), with the experimental results demonstrating that MTMSA outperforms eight representative baseline models.

AB Bayesian Active Learning has had significant impact to various NLP problems, but nevertheless its application to text summarization has been explored very little. We introduce Bayesian Active Summarization (BAS), as a method of combining active learning methods with stateof-the-art summarization models. Our findings suggest that BAS achieves better and more robust performance, compared to random selection, particularly for small and very small data annotation budgets. More specifically, applying BAS with a summarization model like PEGASUS we managed to reach 95% of the performance of the fully trained model, using less than 150 training samples. Furthermore, we have reduced standard deviation by 18% compared to the conventional random selection strategy. Using BAS we showcase it is possible to leverage large summarization models to effectively solve real-world problems with very limited annotated data.

AB Location indices are key in explaining variation in house prices. However, the definition of comprehensive indices capturing all locational features, along with their efficient and timely calculation, is usually one of the most complex dimensions of house price modeling. Existing difficulties result in partial location specifications, mostly due to three hurdles: (1) there is not a consensus on the best method to construct these indices, (2) what features (variables) to include: labor, demographic, commuting, etc., and (3) its creation requires granular and updated datasets. We introduce a methodology based on computer algorithms to create car and walk accessibility indices that address the previous concerns and capture location interactions among a wide range of variables. The selection of variables is based on an automated search of the best performing utility bearing gravitational accessibility indices for price prediction. Once these optimal indices are obtained, the method applies principal components analysis to secure their orthogonality. Using a unique dataset from a leading real estate portal in Europe, we illustrate and test for the city of Madrid their applicability in several house asking price models that are estimated using regression analysis and random forests (as a representative family of machine learning techniques). The experimental analysis reveals that using the optimal indices results in significant improvements in accuracy, for both regression-based models (13%) and random forests (21.6%), while achieving a substantial reduction in spatial autocorrelation (around 35%). The generated indices are clearly interpretable, which makes them a valuable tool for urban analyses (planning, transportation, sustainability, etc.). Finally, the methodology can be extended to other types of real state (commercial, industrial, etc.) and location (country, region, etc.).

   graph convolutional network; Collaborative filtering
AB In the era of remote sensing (RS) big data, in order to alleviate the time cost of acquiring RS images, recommending RS images that meet users' individual needs continues to be an urgent technology. However, the technology accomplished to date has two main problems: (1) they rely on the users' queries and thus lack initiative and cannot tap the users' potential interests and (2) they restrict the users' preferences to temporal and/or spatial information while ignoring other attributes and are not compatible with visual information. In an effort to fully explore the features of RS images and thereby achieve accurate active recommendations, in this paper we propose a new Multi-modal Knowledge graph-aware Deep Graph Attention Network (MMKDGAT) which we built upon graph convolutional networks. Specifically, we first constructed a multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) for RS images to integrate their various attributes as well as visual information, and then we conduct deep relational attention-based information aggregation to enrich the node representations with multi-modal information and higher-order collaborative signals. Our extensive experiments on two simulated RS image recommendation datasets demonstrated that our MMKDGAT achieved noticeable improvement over several state-of-the-art methods in so far as active recommendation accuracy and cold-start recommendation.

AB Accurate interval-valued stock price prediction is challenging and of great interest to investors and profit organizations. In this study, by considering individual stock information and relevant stock information simultaneously, we propose a novel interval dual convolutional neural network (Dual-CNNI) model method to predict interval-valued stock prices. First, the individual and relevant stock information are collected and transformed into images. Then, the Dual-CNNI model is proposed to predict interval-valued stock prices. Specifically, two convolutional neural network (CNN) models with different structures are constructed respectively extract individual stock features and relevant stock features, and then an interval multilayer perceptron (MLPI) model is used for final interval-valued stock price prediction. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted based on six randomly selected stocks, with comparison to several popular machine learning model based methods and interval-valued time series (ITS) prediction methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed Dual-CNNI based method has superior predictive ability.

ID STREAMING FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Nowadays, Multi-Label Feature Selection (MLFS) attracts more and more attention to tackle the high dimensional problem in multi-label data. A key characteristic of existing gradient-based MLFS methods is that they typically consider two-way variable correlations between features and labels, including feature-feature and label-label correlations. However, two-way correlations are not sufficient to steer feature selection since such correlations vary given different additional variables in practical scenarios, which leads to the selected features with relatively-poor classification performance. Motivated by this, we capture three-way variable interactions including feature-feature-label and feature-label-label interactions to further characterize the fluctuating correlations in the context of another variable, and propose a new gradient-based MLFS approach incorporating the above three-way variable interactions into a global optimization objective. Specifically, based on information theory, we develop second-order regularization penalty terms to regard three-way interactions while jointly combining with the main loss term in regard to feature relevance. Then the objective function can be efficiently optimized via a block-coordinate gradient descent schema. Meanwhile, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the regularization terms in exploiting three-way interaction. In addition, experiments conducted on a series of benchmark data sets also verify the validity of the proposed method on multiple evaluation metrics.

ID CLASSIFICATION; GRAINS; MICROSCOPY
AB Automatic pollen detection based on light microscope (LM) images is helpful for pollinosis symptoms prevention. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed to identify pollen grains based on multi-scale feature fusion mechanism. However, in real scenarios, there are two main challenges that need to be considered: (1) Complex pollen characteristics; (2) Irrelevant objects interference. It means that the pollen detection requires not only learning the relationship among multi-scale features but also refining the feature representation. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-based multi-scale feature fusion network (AMFF-Net) for automatic pollen detection on real-world LM images. The proposed AMFF-Net includes three modules: The feature extraction module utilizes the series-connection attention to capture the spatial and channel dependencies of different level feature maps (for solving the challenge 1). In the feature fusion module, a parallel connection attention is able to learn more discriminative feature representation based on bidirectional pathway guidance (for solving the challenge 2). Both are jointly adopted to enhance the representational capacity of the final results in the pollen prediction module. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real-world RPD dataset, and our AMFF-Net achieves the best performance (83.9% of mean average precision) comparing with other state-of-the-art methods. We believe that this work can serve as an important reference for the development of pollen monitoring system in a real scenario.

AB To alleviate the challenges posed by privacy protection, sparse data, cold-start problem and weak interpretation, in this paper, we investigate how to uncover the implicit "social relationships" for user item pairs and create ommendation relationships between users and items in the recommendation systems with no explicit trust relationships. Firstly, according to complex network theory, a recommendation system is presented by a has crogenous network with various types of subnets. Secondly, a novel algorithm 15mRank-15 is designed based on the improved Simiank similarity index, which mainly integrates common and non-common behavior information, as well as attribute information for exploring the implicit social relations, and generates trop types of social subnets. Further, introducing these implicit social relations into the nonnegative matrix factorization QMF) model, another novel algorithm MF-RPM is proposed to reestruct the user-item rating subnet. Then, the integration of the above ne sigarithms derives an algorithm ISR-RAM to crease recommendation ro lationships for the recommendation task. Finally, numerical experiments on ve Meviclens data are con ducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the three new algorithms mentioned above, and we come to the following sanclusions. (1) The SimRank-ISR algorithm provides an in-depth exploration of the implicit social relationships for user item pairs. (2) The IMF-RAM algorithm has convergence properties. (5) To perform better and obtain more accurate recommendations, with the 15R-RAM alganthm, there are optimal parameters achieved. (4) Compared with the other seven benchmark algorithms, the ISR-ARM algorithm shows excellen performance, and its RMSE and MAE are reduced by a maximum of 14,75% and 8.05%, respectively. Addin sionally, it is more effective in alleviating the cold-start problem

ID ROBUST; FILTER; BEAMFORMER; SEPARATION; ALGORITHM
AB In recent years, significant advancements have been made in neural beamforming, leveraging spectral and spatial cues to enhance their performance in multi-channel speech enhancement. When the frame-wise processing mechanism is required, there exists a trade-off between performance and algorithmic delay for existing all-neural beamformers. However, from the perspective of multi-source information fusion, the network is often encapsulated into a black box to entangle and fuse the spatial and spectral features into a nonlinear feature space, which hinders our understanding of how they work collaboratively for target speech extraction. In this regard, this paper proposes to decouple the spatial and spectral domain processing inspired by Taylor's approximation theory. Specifically, we reformulate the time-variant beamforming defined in the spatial domain into the adaptive weighting and mixing of different beam components in the beamspace domain. This reformulation enables us to model the recovery of target speech as a weighted sum operation in the beamspace domain, where each beam component is associated with an introduced unknown term for residual interference cancellation. By virtue of Taylor's series expansion, the recovery process can be decomposed into the superimposition of the 0th-order non-derivative and high-order derivative terms, where the former acts as spatial filtering in the spatial domain, and the latter serves as a residual interference canceller in the spectral domain. We conduct extensive experiments on the spatialized LibriSpeech and L3DAS Challenge datasets. Experimental results show that, compared with existing advanced approaches, the proposed method not only achieves competitive performance in terms of multiple objective metrics but also provides feasible guidance in multi-channel speech enhancement pipeline design.

AB Microgrids (MGs) are sustainable solutions for rural zone electrification that use local renewable resources. However, only careful planning at the start of an MG project can ensure its future optimal operation. In this paper, a novel methodology for MG planning by using the uncertainty characterization of renewable resources and demand is presented. Additionally, a model of electricity consumption is proposed and applied in an isolated rural community. In such communities, consumption patterns typically need to be derived as model inputs because consumption measurements are not available for the planning stage. To obtain these inputs, clustering algorithms based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and fuzzy c-means are used to classify the families of the community given sociodemographic information obtained via surveys. Subsequently, Markov chains (MCs) are employed to generate consumption patterns based on consumption measurements in some dwellings and surveys applied to the community. The nonlinearities and uncertainties associated with renewable resources and consumption are modeled by using prediction interval (PI) models. These PI models provide the required consumption and generation scenarios for deriving the optimal sizing and topological information to address the MG planning problem. The results of the robust planning approach based on scenarios are useful at the feasibility and design phases of an MG project. The proposed methodology is successfully applied to MG planning for a rural Mapuche community, where a conservative criterion was considered to minimize the investment risk. This criterion corresponds to the worst-case scenario in which the demand increases by 19.9% compared to that of the baseline scenario and a lower energy cost is obtained. However, the net present cost and operational costs increase by 14% and 11.75% compared to those of the baseline scenario, respectively.

AB Community search (CS) over attributed heterogeneous information networks (AHINs) takes both network structure and attributes of nodes into consideration, which can support personalized requirement and has gained great interest recently. Nevertheless, existing works are insensitive to the attributes that results from two limitations: (1) The structural cohesiveness metrics is insensitive to the slight quantity changes of nodes in a community. (2) The measurement adopted to measure the relevance between a community and given keywords is inappropriate. Additionally, the insensitivity may also lead to the free rider effect. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we first define structural cohesiveness by using the minimum number of neighbor nodes connected to each node in the community through a meta-path, then define keyword density with the path instances containing the given keywords, afterwards integrate both of them to propose an attribute-sensitive community model ASC that is sensitive to the attributes, and present the CS problem. In order to search community, we first propose a basic CS algorithm, then develop two index based CS algorithms to improve the efficiency, and theoretically prove that these two index based algorithms are more efficient than the basic algorithm. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASC and the efficiency of the developed algorithms.

AB Previous research on information propagation has primarily focused on either online social networks or offline social networks. Additionally, there remains a gap in understanding the propagation of competitive information in emergency scenarios. This paper introduces an SHI1I2R information spreading model to investigate the dynamics of competitive information dissemination and interactions in online and offline two-layer networks during emergencies. To enhance the accuracy of information propagation modeling, we depart from the conventional assumption of constant spreading and decay rates and instead propose nonlinear spreading and interest decay rates within the SHI1I2R model. Employing a microscopic Markov chain approach, we conduct theoretical analysis and derive the spreading threshold of information in two-layer networks. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the SHI1I2R model and explore the factors influencing information propagation. Our findings indicate that information spreads more rapidly and extensively in two-layer networks compared to one-layer networks. Furthermore, the final scale of information dissemination and the speed of propagation follow the order: random network > small-world network > scale-free network > regular network.

AB Recently, Hybrid MIMO phased-array (H-MIMO-PA) radar systems have been demonstrated to offer enhanced target tracking capabilities. In practice, an effective radar resource allocation (RA) strategy can ensure the quality of service (QoS) of subtasks and improve the system resource utilization in multiple target tracking (MTT) applications. In this paper, a robust power allocation strategy is developed with the objectives of enhancing target tracking accuracy (TTA) and low probability of intercept (LPI) performance in H-MIMO-PA radar. Firstly, in order to accurately grasp the air defense battlefield situation and improve the QoS for MTT, we propose a threat assessment model based on the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy (IFE) to calculate the comprehensive threat degree of each target in real time. Next, since the predicted conditional Crame & PRIME;r-Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) is based on the most recently realized measurement and provides an accurate lower bound, the PC-CRLB in clutter is derived and utilized to formulate the task utility function for TTA. In addition, the probability of intercept is derived and adopted as the performance metric for LPI. Due to power allocation process may become conflicting for achieving better TTA and LPI performance at the same time, the Pareto-based bi-objective optimization scheme is adopted, which formulates a non-convex optimization problem. Finally, to solve the formulated model, we propose the modified bi-objective particle swarm optimization (MBOPSO) algorithm. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation algorithm.

AB Industry 5.0 is an emerging phase in the industrial field where humans and the latest technologies work together to bring revolutionary changes to work processes. It is the future of the upcoming generation for smart city development. Operations and designing of smart systems for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices include various types of decision-making at different levels of domains. Highly complex systems have a huge number of variables and decision-making requirements which also needs real-time data gathering from IIoT devices. Fog computing performs a key role by locating IIoT devices close to its proximity and reducing the processing time in comparison to cloud computing for smart systems. It makes smart systems work in a secure, flexible and time-sensitive manner. The presence of sensors makes data-intensive analysis challenging in these systems but fog computing handles it all. Along with other challenges, security is also one of the concerns that can affect the overall system if compromised. The main objective of this article is to introduce hierarchical fog computing-based architecture for smart energy-supplying systems as a part of Industry 5.0. This architecture will be able to support a large number of infrastructural components and provide services efficiently. In this article, validation of the amount of data transmitted by IIoT devices to the cloud per second is done for three different cases: 1. The proposed four-layer fog computing architecture, 2. Fog architecture with only layer three layers with the rest of the computing on the cloud, 3. A traditional system with cloud computing. The proposed approach is validated over state of art approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the security of the architecture is provided using the Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which ensures data confidentiality with minimum overhead.

AB Sudden medical safety accidents or large-scale outbreaks of epidemics will lead to a surge in traffic near hospitals and other medical infrastructure, and traditional edge base stations cannot cope with sudden traffic demands. In addition, the patient's data of health information is private, it is necessary to protect the patient's health in-formation. Therefore, aiming at the practical problems that edge base stations cannot cope with a large number of communication requests and how to protect patients' private data under sudden medical safety accidents, this paper combines hierarchical federated learning with UAV-assisted mobile edge computing environment to build a UAV-assisted MEC system architecture for federated learning. However, federated learning is closely related to participating nodes. Without satisfactory rewards, users and UAVs will be unwilling to consume computing resources and communication resources to participate in federated learning. Therefore, this paper introduced the Stackelberg game and incentive mechanism into federated learning. The interaction between user devices, UAV, and the base station is modeled as a Stackelberg game to determine the maximum amount of data required for model training and the number of user devices and UAV. The incentive mechanism determines the task allocation and reward allocation of federated learning and determines the maximum benefits of three participants in the game process to improve the quality of user devices and the performance of the federated learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can inspire user devices, which have high-quality data, to participate in federated learning training, improve training accuracy and maximize social welfare.

ID SYSTEM
AB Intelligent diagnosis processes rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide possible diagnoses by analyzing patient data and medical information. To make accurate and quick diagnoses, it is possible to use AI tools to efficiently analyze huge amounts of data and find patterns that a clinician might miss. In recent years, new large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google BARD, have shown remarkable capabilities in several domains, including intelligent diagnostics. This research aims to compare the performances of ChatGPT and traditional machine learning models for making diagnoses of low- and medium- risk diseases only based on their symptoms. On the basis of our study, we defined four research questions: RQ1) What are the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT in intelligent diagnosis? RQ2) How do traditional machine learning approaches compare to ChatGPT for intelligent diagnosis? RQ3) How does ChatGPT compare with other LLMs and domain-specific natural language processing models in the intelligent diagnosis tasks?, and RQ4) What are the implications of the predictive models and ChatGPT for healthcare, and how can they be used to support people?. To answer these RQs, we first evaluate the performances of different engines of ChatGPT, also introducing a new prompt engineering methodology specifically tailored for achieving accurate diagnostic outcomes. Moreover, we compare these results with those achieved by different predictive models trained for intelligent diagnosis tasks, i.e., Google BARD, and two domain-specific NLP models. Finally, we propose a new interactive bot available for users that relies on the best-performing models evaluated in the previous steps. The experiments have been conducted using two medical datasets for disease prediction consisting of more than 100 symptoms associated with several diagnoses.

AB The biometric recognition system is a highly precise human identification system as per Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Latent fingerprint biometrics are an efficient human identification system for criminals based on available crime evidence shreds. However, biometric trait limitations such as noise in sensed data, lack of individuality, and intra-class variation result in a low matching score, which has a negative impact on the identification as well as investigation process. The increasing demand for biometric systems for accurate identification has resulted in the development of unimodal biometric systems to multimodal biometric systems, particularly when the biometric inputs are considered as evidence of any societal crime. This paper focuses on showing the advantage of using modal based approach over the threshold based and development of a multimodal biometric framework for achieving high accuracy in human identification. The comparison of the identification rate/recognition probability of modal-based approach (87.3%) is high in compared to thresholdbased approach (80%). Latent fingerprint biometric is fused with iris biometric using score level fusion (sum rule and product rule) rules. With the experimental results, it has been found that highest accuracy rate (91.15%) in proposed identification framework can be achieved while using sum rule. The proposed framework is useful in a societal crime scenario, as assumed in this paper.

AB Motivation: Low-stage lung cancer is known to recur unpredictably, and patients receiving various treatment methods like radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies have been seen to respond very differently. Identifying a priori if a patient is going to relapse or not could make a difference in terms of saving lives and personalized care offered. In this work, we provide an answer to the following research question: Is it possible to enhance the machine learning (ML) of the estimated probability of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with aneuploidy imputation scores?Results: To predict recurrence in 1,348 early-stage (I-II) NSCLC patients, we train graph ML models utilizing the Spanish pulmonary cancer group knowledge graph enriched with triples from pathway imputation. ML models trained on Knowledge graph data enriched with triples from pathway score imputation present an 82% Precision and 91% Specificity in predicting relapse over 200 patients from a held-out test set. ML models trained using graphs data could prove useful supplemental tool in the TNM classification systems and improve a lung cancer patient's prognosis.

AB We examine in this paper some internal CVIs (cluster validity indices) especially designed for the validation of arbitrarily shaped clusters, for example nonconvex clusters or clusters that nearly touch each other or are embedded into other clusters. They are based on the identification of multi-representative points for each cluster and on density considerations. In general, they target clusters characterized by cores of high density surrounded by regions of low density. Such a characterization is exploited to evaluate the separation among clusters, but can be a serious limitation for example when the clusters have high density regions in peripheral positions close to individual borders or have internal regions of non uniform density. Among the CVIs taken into consideration, we especially single out the SSDD index introduced in Liang et al. (2020) and propose some modifications for extending its applicability field. A numerical experimentation on both artificial and real-world datasets has been performed, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed modified index with respect to SSDD index and to other multi-representative CVIs described in literature.

AB Radar high-resolution range profile (HRRP) plays a crucial role in ballistic target recognition due to its simplicity and fast computation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning approach, are widely used in radar automatic target recognition (RATR) based on HRRP, thanks to their excellent feature extraction capabilities. However, current research mainly focuses on integrating branch networks like recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms into vanilla CNNs to enhance feature extraction. Limited research exists on reducing the computational complexity of vanilla CNNs when applied to HRRP-based RATR, as well as target recognition problems with limited samples. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight depth-wise separable fusion CNN (DSFCNN) for ballistic target HRRP recognition. The DSFCNN reduces the computational complexity of vanilla CNNs while improving recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce the sample-level fitting and class-level distinguishability (SFCD) loss for limited-sample ballistic target HRRP recognition. The SFCD loss ensures better fitting performance of all samples, as well as higher intra-class compactness and interclass separability, enhancing the distinguishability of embedded features in limited-sample conditions. During the training phase, the SFCD loss is equally applied to four DSFCNNs with shared structures and parameters, resulting in a model known as Quadruplet DSFCNN (QDSFCNN). However, during the testing phase, only one DSFCNN is utilized. Additionally, we propose the parameter quantity shifting-fitting performance (PQS-FP) coordinate system to elucidate the performance disparities between DSFCNN and vanilla CNNs in our experiments. PQS-FP offers inspirational insights into the relations among parameter quantity, fitting performance, and recognition performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of QDSFCNN for ballistic target recognition in various limited-sample scenarios.

AB With the wide application of the shield tunneling method in tunnel engineering, the untimely and incorrect attitude control of shield systems has become an essential factor affecting the quality of shield tunneling. The use of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to learn correct and timely shield attitude correction policies is beneficial for handling shield attitude control tasks which are complex and separable. However, the sensing data of the shield systems are complicated and widely distributed, which affects the learning efficiency of the agents. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a MADRL framework based on state classification and assignment (SCA) for adaptive shield attitude control. SCA-MADRL uses a clustering algorithm to classify states and uses a planning model to make the agent's learning space a consistent state space so that each agent can learn efficiently in its own learning space. The state classification algorithm in the framework can improve the learning efficiency of the agent, and the proposed assignment algorithm can further enhance the learning effect when reusing the agent. This paper verifies the necessity and effectiveness of using task decomposition to implement MADRL for equipment control and provides a practical framework for automated and intelligent shield systems.

AB Finding a more efficient trading strategy has always been one of the main concerns in financial market trading. In order to create trading strategies that lead to higher profits, historical data must be used. Due to a large amount of financial data and various factors affecting them, algorithmic trading and, more recently, artificial intelligence are employed to overcome the decision-making complexity. This paper aims to introduce a new approach using Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3) and the daily close price to create a trading strategy. As a continuous action space deep reinforcement learning algorithm, in contrast to the discrete ones, the TD3 provides us with both the number of trading shares and the trading positions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the comparison results of our approach and other commonly-used algorithms such as technical analysis, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, stochastic strategies, and deterministic strategies are reported. By employing both position and the number of trading shares, we show that the performance of a trading strategy can be improved in terms of Return and Sharpe ratio.

AB Due to the rapid expansion of high-speed wireless communications, the number of customers has significantly increased. Ultra-dense networks (UDN) now support a greater number of mission-critical applications and users. To overcome communication limitations in UDN caused by natural disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced to assist. However, because the number of communication resources and links per unit area within the UDN is very dense, high-quality and efficient planning and resource allocation for the UDN becomes difficult. Therefore, we propose an Optimizing Resource Allocation in UAV-Assisted UDN with Optimal Ensemble SVM using the Levy flight-based EOSA to improve Energy Efficiency (EE) of the network. The developed resource allocation approach is efficiently allocates network resources to maximize Quality of Service (QoS) and network performance. To improve the population diversity and prevent the algorithm from exploring already visited solutions, the levy flight operator was incorporated into the Ebola Optimization Search Algorithm (EOSA). The levy flight-based EOSA algorithm was then used to optimize time and power transmission, thereby increasing the average throughput. To handle the dynamic and complex class of UAV-assisted ultra-dense network environments, an ensemble SVM method was used. An optimal ensemble SVM model was trained on a large dataset of relevant performance metrics and network parameters, enabling the model to accurately predict network performance for various resource allocation scenarios. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method significantly enhances EE compared to existing techniques.

AB Assessing the health status of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and predicting their outcome are highly challenging problems and one of the reasons for poor management of ICU resources worldwide. A better pathophysiological understanding of patients' state evolution in the ICU can enhance effective medical interventions. Therefore, there is a need to monitor and analyze the pulmonary function of a ICU patient with COVID-19 and its impact on cardiovascular and other systems. To achieve this, chest X-rays (CXRs), respiratory sounds and all the routinely monitored parameters, scores and metrics in the COVID-19 ICU were recorded from 171 ICU patients with COVID-19 from June 2020 until December 2021. Features were extracted from respiratory sounds, deep learning analysis was conducted on CXRs, and logistic regression analysis was performed on routine ICU clinical variables. Deep learning pipelines were established to classify patients' outcomes (survival or death) at two time points (ICU mortality or 90-day mortality) using three input configurations: (a) CXRs, (b) a fusion of CXRs and respiratory sounds features, or (c) a fusion of CXRs, respiratory sounds features, and principal features of the ICU clinical measurements. The performance of the latter approach was promising, achieving, for ICU mortality, an accuracy of 0.761 and an AUC of 0.759, and for 90-day mortality, an accuracy of 0.743 and an AUC of 0.752, while the performance of approaches (a) and (b) was worse. Therefore, using multi-source data and longitudinal COVID-19 ICU data offers a better prediction of the outcome in the ICU, thereby optimizing medical decisions and interventions. Furthermore, we show that adding the adventitious respiratory sounds features significantly increased AUC and accuracy for mortality prediction of ICU patients with COVID-19.

AB The problem of precise modeling of Synchronous Generator (SG) devices is demanding and crucial for monitoring, stability, and control of electric grids and microgrids. SGs are known to exhibit nonlinear behavior, and because they may work in a wide range of operating points due to different electric network phenomena like load changes, current intermittent renewable energy resources, temperature variations, topological changes, etc., the modeling task of SG can be a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new method to find a global model for a synchronous generator from the input and output measurement data using state-of-the-art methods in artificial intelligence (AI) like fuzzy clustering, subspace identification, and Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling. The fuzzy C-means method is utilized to cluster the measurement data, and then using a subspace identification method based on Markov parameters concepts, the dynamic model of SG for each cluster is obtained in the form of a state space model. A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is applied to determine the corresponding outputs based on the measured inputs and the available state space models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by applying it to the data obtained from simulations on a known fourth-order SG nonlinear model and the data obtained from real-world experimental tests.

DE External knowledge; Reinforcement learning; Graph neural network;
   Sentiment analysis
AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a subtask of sentiment classification, and the difficulty is how to capture the sentiment aspect and sentiment polarity pairs in a sentence. Early studies applied serialization models with attention mechanisms to mine sentiment information. These models are simple and effective, but cannot accurately capture sentiment pairs when encountering complex sentences. Recently, scholars have applied dependency information to construct various graph neural networks for the ABSA task. Compared with serialized models, these structured models demonstrate the graph neural network is powerful in capturing information, and further illustrates the syntactic information is effective for sentiment analysis. However, these syntactic models are usually influenced by syntactic parsers, especially for complex sentences. Hence, this paper builds a Lexicon and Syntax Enhanced Opinion Induction Tree for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (LSOIT). Specifically, inducing knowledge-aware opinion induction trees for each aspect word applied by reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms that integrate the lexicon knowledge (i.e. sememe knowledge) and syntax knowledge (i.e. phrase structures, and dependency relationships). Finally, we establish graph neural networks on knowledge-aware opinion induction tree for ABSA. Experimental results on four benchmarking datasets (i.e., Rest14, Laptop14, Twitter and MAMS) demonstrate that LSOIT significantly improves 2.21%, 0.47%, and 0.18% on Rest14, Laptop14, and MAMS comparing with state-of-the-art models, respectively. Ablation Study and Case Study manifest that external knowledge is useful, especially for datasets with standardized grammar rules.

AB The motive of this work is to provide the numerical performances of the monkeypox transmission mathematical model by using a novel deep neural network process with eleven and twenty-two neurons in the hidden layers. The purpose to provide the deep neural network stochastic process is to obtain more accurate solutions of the monkeypox transmission mathematical system. This process is enhanced by using an activation radial basis function in both layers for solving the monkeypox transmission mathematical model along with the implementation of the Bayesian regularization optimization scheme. The presentation of the mathematical dynamical model has two categories, human and rodent. The human dynamics is classified into, susceptible, exposed, infectious, clinically ill human and recovered individuals. The rodent is divided into three forms, susceptible, exposed, and infected. A dataset is presented with the Adam approach that is processed using the training, testing, and certification procedure by taking the data as 0.13, 0.12 and 0.15. The correctness is observed through the matching of the results and the statistical plots are plotted using the regression, state transition, error histograms and correlation.

AB The challenge of selecting the best transportation mode is one of the most significant issues that organizations deal with during the product delivery phase. Many criteria that influence the selection of an appropriate mode of transportation are indicative of how challenging this problem is. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid decision making methodology based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFS) is proposed to obtain the most suitable transportation mode by considering the determined criteria. The criteria are decided according to both experts' opinions and literature review results. Afterwards, experts' opinions in the company are consulted for the evaluation of the determined transportation mode alternatives. Then, relying on IVIF-CRITIC technique, criteria weights are determined. Subsequently, IVIF-TOPSIS method is applied to rank the alternatives. Because the combination of these methodologies has never been applied to solve the problem at hand, the developed methodology and the application area represent a novelty. According to the results of our study, the railway has been determined as the most proper transportation mode for the glass manufacturing company. To show the robustness of the proposed methodology, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by both changing the criteria weights and applied methodology. The results show that in all scenarios the ranking of alternatives is similar.

AB Mental health is an integral part of human welfare in the present era. The present research aims to bring attention to mental health issues with the help of social network, which turns into an influential forum for depressed individuals to express their sentiments and emotions. In this work, a contemporary depression detection framework that incorporates a prominent feature extraction approach and an optimized Gated Broad Learning System (G-BLS) is proposed. The feature extraction method captures Syntactic, Semantic, and Sentiment information of words and forms 3S feature embeddings. The extracted 3S feature vectors are then fed into the G-BLS model for depressive tweet classification. The G-BLS network often transfers redundant hidden nodes to the output layer because of its structural properties. To address this problem, a new binary optimization algorithm abbreviated as T-pHBGO is introduced by hybridizing the Honey Badger (HB) algorithm and Gannet Optimizer (GO) along with a T-shaped binary transfer function and population reduction strategy. The T-pHBGO algorithm selects the relevant and ideal neuron nodes to intensify the classification performance. The extensive experiments are conducted using two distinct Twitter corpora from the Kaggle repository. Accuracy and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures are used to evaluate the system in contrast to other existing depression detection models. The comparative outcomes revealed that the composition of 3S word embedding, G-BLS model, and T-pHBGO algorithm surpasses the competing methods with an accuracy of 99.2% and 96.3%, RMSE rate of 0.0592 and 0.0417 for Sentiment 140 and Twitter depression corpus. The Analysis of Variance F-test confirmed the statistical significance of the results. The cross-validation results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of maintaining its performance despite the use of different test data, as evidenced by the average classification accuracy.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Medical images are closely related to the patient's condition. We put forward the model of Sin-Arcsin-Arnold Multi-Dynamic random nonadjacent Coupled Map Lattice (SAMCML) and found that it has good chaotic prop-erties, so we used it to design an encryption scheme for protecting medical multi-images. First, we randomly change the three bits of binary information in medical images, then the binary information before and after blurring is spliced into new pixels. We let them combine with SHA-512 to design and generate random keys. Convert the three binary bits before the blurred pixel into 0-7, then encode the image with DNA technology (Deoxyribonucleic acid technology). We designed 3D-Fisher, which realized random cross-plane scrambling. Then, new DNA operations and asymmetric DNA coding and decoding rules are designed to achieve high-quality diffusion, thus obtaining multiple ciphertext images with different sizes. Finally, the bit-plane information before blurring is used to generate new pixels. They are filled into images with a smaller size, and multiple ciphertext images with the same size are obtained. The NPCR, UACI, and entropy of this algorithm are very close to the ideal values. Compared with other algorithms, it still has some advantages in data and can be applied to medical scenes.

AB In this article, a new ensemble learning model called GATE is proposed to improve the accuracy and stability of time-series forecasting, which is a crucial aspect of modern engineering practices. Despite the promise of deep learning (DL) models in this area, their performance can be volatile due to the diversity of time series data. To address this, the GATE model combines the strengths of recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and convolution-LSTM (Conv-LSTM) structures and utilizes an unsupervised learning strategy to steer the ensemble output using a guided network. To prevent overfitting in DL models, GATE optimizes the sample loss function and the weight updating function for each individual model within the ensemble structure. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed GATE method on four real-world datasets is presented. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that GATE surpasses state-of-the-art ensemble methods and individual models, exhibiting the best performance in terms of testing errors. Notably, GATE outperforms existing single models in addressing long-term prediction tasks. To validate the effectiveness of GATE, ablation studies is carried out, comparing different ensemble combinations involving two distinct models. Through systematic analysis, these studies provided valuable insights into the performance of various ensemble configurations, further confirming the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed GATE method.

ID SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; MODEL; ALGORITHM
AB Early rainfall prediction is very important to ensure the economic balance of any agriculture-dominated country, such as India. Deep learning has recently received considerable attention for predicting rainfall using historical data. However, rainfall depends on multiple factors like ElNino, rising sea levels, warming of the Atlantic Ocean, etc. The changing climate has also significantly increased rainfall variability. The current deep-learning approaches are either based on a limited set of predictors or do not utilize the time-series properties for the recurrence of similar climate conditions every 12 months. Besides, they perform poorly in predicting accurate rainfall estimates for the diverse areas of India due to limited data availability across various regions. Therefore, this paper presents a groundbreaking solution to address the challenge of limited data by introducing RfGan (Rainfall GAN), a novel variant of generative adversarial networks. RfGan aims to fulfill the crucial need for abundant data to ensure the effectiveness of model training. Moreover, a novel rainfall prediction method, RfGanNet, has been introduced that leverages the strengths of the proposed RfGan for data augmentation, long-short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks for rainfall prediction. The performance of RfGanNet has been validated for India and its clustered regions in terms of nine parameters: precision, recall, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, accuracy, F1-score, mean absolute error, mean square error and computation time. The experimental results of RfGan are compared against original and synthetic datasets generated from state-of-the-art methods, namely tabular gan (TGAN), Wasserstein gan (WGAN), and conditional tabular gan (CTGAN). The experimental results indicate that the proposed RfNet model, when trained using RfGan-generated data, surpassed all the other considered methods by achieving 97.22 % accuracy. Moreover, RfNet has been compared with other related deep Learning approaches to validate its efficacy. Additionally, an ablation study investigating various LSTM-CNN combinations has been conducted. The findings of the study indicate that oceanic and climate-related predictors have a noteworthy influence on Indian rainfall. Moreover, the study highlights the suitability of combining Bidirectional LSTM, CNN, and multiple predictors for accurate rainfall prediction.

AB Domain adaptation is a good way to boost BERT's performance on domain-specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Common domain adaptation methods, however, can be deficient in capturing domain knowledge. Meanwhile, the context fragmentation inherent in Transformer-based models also hinders the acquisition of domain knowledge. Considering the semi-structural characteristics of documents and its potential for alleviating these problems, we leverage the semi-structured information of documents to supplement domain knowledge to BERT. To this end, we propose a topic-based domain adaptation method, which enhances the capture of domain knowledge at various levels of text granularity. Specifically, topic masked language modeling is designed at the paragraph level for pre-training; topic subsection matching degree dataset is automatically constructed at the subsection level for intermediate fine-tuning. Experiments are conducted over four biomedical NLP tasks across six datasets. The results show that our method benefits BERT, RoBERTa, SpanBERT, BioBERT, and PubMedBERT in nearly all cases. And we see significant gains in two question answering (QA) tasks, especially customer health QA, the topic-related one, with an average accuracy improvement of 4.8%. Thus, the semi-structured information of documents can be exploited to make BERT capture domain knowledge more effectively.

ID SELECTION; METHODOLOGY; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK
AB Nowadays, because of the increase in global competition and the need to pay attention to sustainable issues, achieve a competitive advantage, reduce costs, and improve Supply Chain (SC) network management, the use of blockchain and its integration have become necessary in the network. The use of Blockchain Technology (BT) leads to transparency, controllability, security, flexibility, visibility, reduction of costs, efficient processes, and achieving sustainable development goals in the SC network. To successfully implement BT in SC, it is necessary to identify and evaluate the operational solutions to solve the challenges and obstacles of BT. Therefore, this study aims to identify and evaluate BT implementation solutions to achieve sustainability in the SC. The novelties and contributions of this research include identifying blockchain solutions to achieve sustainable development goals in the SC, proposing a new application for the agricultural products SC to utilize blockchain, and presenting a novel hybrid decision procedure including the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) using on Z-numbers for evaluating solutions. The proposed approach can deal with ambiguity in the complex environment of the decision due to the consideration of reliability and uncertainty in the data, reducing the number of pairwise comparisons, low inconsistency rate, reducing the complexity of calculations, ease of implementation, no limit in the number of criteria, no dependence on predetermined scales, and providing compromise solutions based on different opinions of experts. To examine the results, sensitivity analysis, and validation were performed. The findings showed that for the successful implementation of blockchain in the agricultural SC, the infrastructure of this technology must be created and integrated with all levels of the SC, and using BT must be provided through the use of sustainable methods. By developing areas of cooperation and participation through the creation of facilitating rules between different partners in the SC, collective investments can be made in the development of the infrastructure.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB Deciding the signal length is an important challenge for one-class time-series classification (OCTSC). This paper aims to develop an OCTSC algorithm that does not require model retraining for different signal lengths. For this purpose, a distance-based one-class time-series classification approach using local cluster balance (OCLCB) is proposed. OCLCB extracts feature vectors, namely, local cluster balance (LCB), from the clustering results of sliding windows. K-means clustering is applied to the sliding windows extracted from the training signal. Then, the local prototype (LP) is calculated as the average of the local cluster balance (LCB) in the training data. Unseen scores are computed as the distance metrics between LP and LCBs in the testing data. Since the sliding window size is independent of the entire signal size, OCLCB does not need to retrain the model. This aspect gives the benefit of reducing the parameter tuning costs. The source code is uploaded at https://github.com/ToshiHayash i/OCLCB.

AB Monthly rainfall prediction is a crucial topic for the management of water resources and prevention of hydrological disasters. To make a multi-step monthly rainfall prediction and discover the primary factors affecting rainfall, this study presents an explainable deep learning approach that integrates four consecutive modules, namely the Gated-Recurrent-Unit-based (GRU-based) encoder module, attention mechanism module, GRU-based decoder module, and expected-gradient-based explanation module, respectively. The first three modules constitute an encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism which could predict monthly rainfall in multiple continuous months in the future, while the explanation module computes attribution values for the input weather and climate features to quantify their importance. A case study is conducted on monthly rainfall data collected from Darwin and Perth, Australia, from Jan 1921 to Dec 2020. The results mainly indicate that: (1) Compared with the baseline methods, the multi-step monthly rainfall predictions made by the encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism show better agreement with the ground truth. (2) For January rainfall in Darwin, the most important weather factors are last January and February rainfall, while the most critical climate index is last February's Southern Oscillation Index, with its high values inhibit while low values promote January rainfall in Darwin. (3) The most significant feature for June rainfall in Perth is last June's solar radiation whose feature value is weakly negatively correlated with its attribution value. The study's significance lies in enhancing the accuracy of multi-step rainfall prediction and providing interpretability through identification of influential factors, which facilitates long-term planning of water resources and deeper understanding of complex weather systems.

AB With the rapid development of deep learning, emotion recognition from facial expressions has also greatly improved, but there are still limitations in terms of reliability when applied to the real world. In other words, facial expressions and the corresponding true emotions may be inconsistent. So, although audio or bio signals are additionally used to improve the reliability of emotion recognition, reasonable estimation performance or real-time operation of emotion recognition is not guaranteed yet. This paper addresses both of the above challenging issues. Each sensor input and feature extraction process is totally and asynchronously processed through a parallel processing library. And then, we predict the comprehensive state of the subject's internal/external emotions through modality-adaptive fusion, which considers the influence of the features of each modality. We verified the performance of the proposed system through a real-time pilot test, and achieved accuracy of up to 33% higher than emotion recognition using only external signals, i.e., video and audio.

AB Geographical Topic Phrases (GTPs) are specialized terms for describing geographical objects, phenomena, or events and are frequently used to organize, navigate, and index geographical resources (e.g., geographical data hosted in geoportals). Typically, GTPs are stored in knowledge bases (e.g., a thesaurus). However, most existing knowledge bases are manually constructed and often updated on an annual or decennial cycle, leading to the exclusion of many newly emerging GTPs. These emerging GTPs are often discussed in geographical literature. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method to automatically extract out-of-vocabulary GTPs from geographical literature to either create a new knowledge base or automatically update existing ones. The state-ofthe-art GTPs extraction approaches are deep learning-based models. The existing ones, however, did not consider the relative distance between vocabularies, leading to their limited capability of capturing and learning relationships between words in a sequence. In this work, we present GeoTPE, a neural network model fusing BiLSTM-CRF and BERT enhanced with relative position embedding for extracting GTPs from literature, and evaluate this model by applying it to two datasets, including a dataset harvested from geographical literature of high-ranked journals. The experimental results show that our model can not only achieve the best performance in comparison with baseline models, but also can discover novel GTPs, thus enriching existing knowledge bases.

AB This paper provides a time series analysis of the Bank of Japan (BOJ)'s exchange traded fund (ETF) and real estate investment trust (REIT) purchase program. The program is a part of the BOJ's unconventional monetary policy introduced in December 2010 and the timing and quantity of purchases have changed substantially over time. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt at investigating the purchase program from a dynamic viewpoint and developing a system that takes expert knowledge as input to analyze the BOJ's purchase program and outputs a trading strategy. Firstly, to find factors underlying decisions of the BOJ's purchases, we apply a state space model with explanatory variables obtained by expert knowledge, which is an extension of a logistic regression and enables us to predict their timings with high accuracy throughout all periods. Secondly, we figure out the dynamics of the program's effect on equity and REIT prices by using a different type of state space model.Finally, we find a profitable trading strategy that incorporates the insights revealed in the above dynamic analysis and that focuses on an effect of the BOJ's purchase on the spread between the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) and Nikkei225 Index (Nikkei225). In addition, we implement event studies, particularly the price dynamics of ETF and REIT just before and after the purchase.

AB Researchers working in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles are observing rapid developments in the field, such as the use of quadrotors to grasp, manipulate, and transport objects. These advancements are made possible through sophisticated control systems, new types of actuation and sensing technologies, and a greater understanding of the aerodynamic effects and gyroscopic moment generated by the rotating blades of the quadrotor involved. Therefore, this research work proposes four novel optimized control laws, i.e., conditioned adaptive barrier-based double integral super twisting sliding mode controller (CABDIST-SMC), BF double integral SMC (BF-DISMC), BF integral SMC, and barrier function-based SMC control laws, for attitude, heading, position, and altitude trajectory tracking of the quadcopter. The non-linear model of the quadcopter is developed using the Lagrange formalism in MATLAB ODE-45 environment, including the gyroscopic moments and aerodynamic effects, and a Lyapunov stability analysis is performed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the system. A 3D-helical complex trajectory is employed to analyze the performance and consistency of the proposed optimized controllers. For performance comparison, the proposed four variants of the SMC are compared with three traditional control strategies, i.e., backstepping SMC, optimized adaptive SMC via particle swarm optimization algorithm, and improved adaptive SMC. These traditional control strategies have also been developed and tested in MATLAB-Simulink. All the controllers are optimized using the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm, and to determine the best control law, six performance indexes, i.e., mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), integral square error (ISE), integral absolute error (IAE), integral time absolute error (ITAE), and integral time square error (ITSE) are used. A hardware-in-loop (HIL) test is also performed to validate the performance of the designed novel control law. The C2000 Delfino MCU F28379D launchpad is used for performing the HIL validation test. The simulated results showed that the performance of optimized CABDIST-SMC surpassed all other control laws for altitude, heading, position, and attitude trajectory tracking. It has achieved MAPE of 0.02%, RMSE of 3.9912e-5, ISE of 3.1859e-8, IAE of 7.9823e-4, ITAE of 0.0080, and ITSE of 3.1849e-7 in case of yaw angle control. The proposed control laws have successfully passed the HIL validation test, and real-time implementation of the proposed control laws indicates no significant variations compared to the simulated results.

AB Modeling and estimating mixed memberships for overlapping unipartite un-weighted networks has been well studied in recent years. However, to our knowledge, there is no model for a more general case, the overlapping bipartite weighted networks. To close this gap, we introduce a novel model, the Bipartite Mixed Membership Distribution-Free (BiMMDF) model. Our model allows an adjacency matrix to follow any distribution as long as its expectation has a block structure related to node membership. In particular, BiMMDF can model overlapping bipartite signed networks and it is an extension of many previous models, including the popular mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. An efficient algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of consistent estimation is applied to fit BiMMDF. We then obtain the separation conditions of BiMMDF for different distributions. Furthermore, we also consider missing edges for sparse networks. The advantage of BiMMDF is demonstrated in extensive synthetic networks and eight real-world networks.

AB Android has been a significant target of malware applications due to the exponential growth of mobile devices. This may result in severe threats to Android users such as financial loss, information leakage etc. The security of smartphones has encouraged the researchers in applying machine learning techniques to enhance the Android malware detection rate as the traditional approaches are not effective in distinguishing unknown malware. In recent years, many malicious apps have been detected on Android devices using machine learning based approaches. The problem with these detection systems is that they give a high false positive and false negative rate. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods for better identifying and classifying malware. The main contribution of this paper is to improve the classification accuracy by fusing the base classifiers. This paper proposes a fusion approach named as MalDetect that enables an effective combination of machine learning techniques to improve the identification rate of malware. The proposed approach is based on the base classifiers and a set of ranking algorithms defined on their predictive error rate. The purpose of this method is to improve the detection rate of Android malware. Two datasets i.e. Drebin and AndroMD are used to illustrate the effec-tiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better than the individual base classifiers and traditional ensemble learning techniques for identifying Android malware. Further, the proposed approach is compared with the renowned Stacking ensemble technique that uses a meta- classifier. From the experimental outcomes, it is found that the weighted F-measure obtained from the Stacking for Drebin and AndroMD datasets is 0.9811 and 0.9775 respectively whereas the weighted F-measure acquired from the proposed approach is 0.9857 and 0.9790 respectively.

AB In order to predict wind power quickly and accurately and reduce the negative impact of wind power instability on the grid, this study proposes an ultra-short-term wind power prediction model based on financial technical indicators and parameter optimization algorithms. Firstly, historical wind power time series data calculates the financial technical indicators. Secondly, the Monte Carlo method and rank ant colony algorithm are used to optimize the parameters of financial technical indicators calculation. Finally, the future wind power is predicted based on the XGBoost algorithm combining financial technical indicators with historical power. The proposed model is validated on several wind power datasets from different countries and compared with various comparative models, leading to several important conclusions: (1) Fintech indicators can effectively indicate the intrinsic characteristics of wind power time-series data. (2) The variational ant colony algorithm can make the financial technical indicators better fit the wind power time-series data trends. (3) The proposed model has high prediction accuracy and speed and has similar prediction accuracy to the mainstream deep learning models. (4) The proposed model is not limited by meteorological, geographical, and seasonal factors and can make predictions by relying only on historical wind power data.

AB Clinicians and researchers commonly assess hand movements to detect and monitor neurological disorders. With the growing use of deep learning and biomedical informatics, computer vision can be applied to hand movement videos to extract movement features. Such methods promise objective and automated measures of hand movements which can potentially reveal richer details than clinicians in a face-to-face setting. However, extracting valid measures from hand movement video data is a challenging task because motion blur occurs when the hands move quickly. To address this issue, current de-blurring methods have been investigated and a novel 'Parallel Scale Deblur Net' (PSDNet) is proposed for hand movement image de-blurring. The results demonstrate that PSDNet achieves better de-blurring performance on both a general blur dataset (available online) and also on our own hand motion dataset.

AB To meet the frequent transportation requirements between distributed manufacturing services (MSs), logistics services (LSs) have played an essential role in cloud manufacturing. However, previous studies on service scheduling focused on MSs and simply treated the logistics process as a linear relationship with distance. In fact, the resulting scheduling scheme for MSs is prone to deterioration in practical implementation when the dynamic nature of LSs is neglected. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-objective model for dual-service integrated scheduling of manufacturing and logistics (DISML) and proposes an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (INSGA-II) to solve it. The integration of manufacturing and logistics processes introduces complex constraints, making it challenging to properly represent the solution. To address this challenge, a novel threelayer encoding approach is designed and its feasibility is demonstrated through directed graphs. Additionally, several problem-dependent heuristics are developed to enhance solving efficiency. Experimental results show that INSGA-II outperforms other algorithms in terms of IGD and C metric in 96% and 83% of instances, respectively. The results also demonstrate the advantages of the DISML mode over the decentralized scheduling mode in terms of solution quality and efficiency. Our proposed model and the results presented here provide managers with a new tool to help them schedule MSs and LSs more effectively, thereby improving production efficiency, reducing costs and unexpected delays in execution.

AB Topology control is an efficient and low-cost measure to adjust the power flow to ensure the security and economic operation of power systems. Since topology control involves large-scale action space and is difficult to solve by traditional optimization methods, the reinforcement learning paradigm has been regarded as a promising solution in recent years. However, the effective action space of topology control is too sparse to explore a useful policy for conventional reinforcement learning. To explicitly utilize the hierarchical semantic information of different actions to reduce the exploration space, this paper presents a novel progressive decision-making framework that enables the agent to carry out an effective action of topology control in multiple stages like human operators. The proposed framework uses a graph convolution network to extract the node-level and graph-level features, that explicitly account for the topological information with different granularity concealed in the power system. Based on the features of different receptive field precision from coarse to fine, the framework distinguishes whether the power system is secure and requires intervention in the first stage. Then the pivotal node is located in the second stage, and the corresponding bus assignment action is performed on this node in the last stage. Simulation results on two different power systems show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the action space of topology control and improves performance compared with several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.

AB Modifying some keywords or numbers on documents to change the original intention is illegal. In some litigation cases, especially economic cases, there is often a need to examine the type of ink on documents. This paper proposes a nondestructive and accurate detection method for ink inspection. In this work, a high-information interactive, full group residual convolution network (FGRC-Net) is proposed and combined with spectral in-formation to classify the inks of six different brands of pens. First, FGRC-Net realizes the information interaction among channels to effectively improve the feature extraction ability through multigroup convolution and multipath cascade. Meanwhile, to avoid feature degradation, the residual connection is introduced. Second, the ink spectral information of six pens based on the hyperspectral system is obtained. Finally, in comparing FGRC-Net and other deep learning methods, FGRC-Net shows the best classification performance with 98.38% accu-racy, 98.53% precision, and 98.40% recall. The results show that combining FGRC-Net with a hyperspectral system is an effective detection method for handwritten ink classification. It also provides an effective detection method for handwritten document ink inspection. At the same time, the universality and validity of FGRC-Net in processing spectral information are verified by the comparison of multiple datasets.

AB Trigger-action programming (TAP) in the Internet of Things (IoT) enables users to easily customize the desired behaviors of connected entities, such as smart devices and online services, by creating trigger-action rules, also known as recipes. An example of such a rule is "If Sunset, Then Turn on lights". As potential trigger-action combinations grow exponentially, there has been significant interest in automatically generating recipes based on users' natural language instead of relying on manual creation. In this article, we present TAPFuser, an IoT data fusion framework designed to encode natural language and recipes, aiming to map human demand and recipes using a heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding approach. Firstly, we divide TAP data into machine and human levels based on their sources. We then model these two levels of data as an IoT-HIN and employ HIN embedding techniques to learn vector representations of nodes, which is beneficial for recipe recommendation. To enhance the adaptive capabilities of TAPFuser, we propose a specific metagraph-guided random walk method that captures the level-aware heterogeneity of the IoT-HIN. Finally, we formulate the mapping between natural language generated by the human level and recipes generated by the machine level as a multi-label classification problem, where each node represents a natural language description, and the label corresponds to the category of the entity included in the recipe. We conducted multi-label classification experiments using the IFTTT dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB As an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in modifying gene function and controlling gene expression during cell development, DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) is still lack of researching. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict the 4mC sites to make fully aware of its mechanism and function. In this paper, we propose a novel model which is called Structural Sparse Regularized Random Vector Functional Link Network (SSR-RVFL) for predicting 4mC sites. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, SSR-RVFL performs better and achieves higher prediction accuracy. There are total six benchmark datasets used in the experiments, namely C.elegans, D.elanogaster, E.coli, A.thaliana G.subterraneus and G.pickeringii. Our model improves the accuracy by 0.42%, 0.45%, 0.48%, 0.91%, 0.66% and 0.7% on these six benchmark datasets respectively, so it can be regarded as a more effective prediction tool.

AB Due to the emergence of new network attack technologies, cloud manufacturing platforms may be subject to various network attacks at any time. Traditional network attack prediction aims to predict the upcoming types of network attacks with monitored data characteristics, and this prediction method cannot accurately learn the network attack traffic that the cloud manufacturing platform may suffer in the future. Network attack traffic prediction means the future network attack traffic prediction by using past data. Traditional machine learning approaches cannot investigate complex nonlinear features. Deep learning methods can investigate nonlinear characteristics, yet they suffer from the problem of overfitting. In addition to this, deep learning approaches suffer from gradient disappearance and explosion. To solve them, we design a network attack traffic method called S-Informer, which integrates the filter of Savitzky-Golay, the self-attention of ProbSparse in a generative decoder and an encoder for eliminating noise, reducing the network scale and improving the speed of prediction. Real-life dataset-based experimental results show that S-Informer achieves higher prediction accuracy than several commonly-used algorithms.

AB Identification of the optimal subset of features for Feature Selection (FS) problems is a demanding problem in machine learning and data mining. A trustworthy optimization approach is required to cope with the concerns involved in such a problem. Here, a Binary version of the Capuchin Search Algorithm (CSA), referred to as BCSA, was developed to select the optimal feature combination. Owing to the imbalance of parameters and random nature of BCSA, it may sometimes fall into the trap of an issue called local maxima. To beat this problem, the BCSA could be further improved with the resettlement of its individuals by adopting some methods of repopulating the individuals during foraging. Levy flight was applied to augment the exploitation and exploration abilities of BCSA, a method referred to as LBCSA. A Chaotic strategy is used to reinforce search behavior for both exploration and exploitation potentials of BCSA, which is referred to as CBCSA. Finally, Levy flight and chaotic sequence are integrated with BCSA, referred to as LCBCSA, to increase solution diversity and boost the openings of finding the global optimal solutions. The proposed methods were assessed on twenty-six datasets collected from the UCI repository. The results of these methods were compared with those of other FS methods. Overall results show that the proposed methods render more precise solutions in terms of accuracy rates and fitness scores than other methods.

AB Multi-view classification aims to efficiently utilize information from different views to improve classification performance. In recent researches, many effective multi-view learning methods have been proposed to perform multi-view data analysis. However, most existing methods only consider the correlations between views but ignore the potential correlations between samples. Normally, the views of samples belonging to the same category should have more consistency information and those belonging to different categories should have more distinctions. Therefore, we argue that the correlations and distinctions between the views of different samples also contribute to the construction of feature representations that are more conducive to classification. In order to construct a end-to-end general multi-view classification framework that can better utilize sample information to obtain more reasonable feature representation, we propose a novel joint long and short span self -attention network (JLSSAN). We designed two different self-attention spans to focus on different information. They enable each feature vector to be iteratively updated based on its attention to other views and other samples, which provides better integration of information from different views and different samples. Besides, we adopt a novel weight-based loss fusion strategy, which facilitates the model to learn more reasonable self-attention map between views. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 3% in accuracy on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrates that our method is effective.

AB Intersection traffic signal control considering vehicle emissions has become an important topic, however, the decision complexity of traffic signal control increases dramatically in a dynamic traffic environment with multiintersections. It is a severe challenge to coordinate traffic signals at multi-intersections based on Internet of Things information to improve the traffic condition of the road network. This paper proposes a two-layer coordination algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning-Multi-agent Coordinated Policy Optimization (MACoPO), for solving traffic signal control at multi-intersections. MACoPO consists of local cooperation, which adjusts the weights of individual rewards and neighborhood agents' rewards by using local cooperation factors (LCF), and global coordination, which updates the LCF to maximize global rewards. The state and reward functions are designed in terms of the current state of the signal, waiting queue length, vehicle density and emission concentration in the lane, vehicle delay, and vehicle emissions, thus making full use of the intersection state information. The proposed method is extensively assessed through simulation experiments using artificial and real road networks and the numerical results confirm its effectiveness in complex and dynamic real-time traffic environments with multi-intersections.

DE Image classification; Transfer learning; Feature extraction; Multiscale
AB Deep learning architectures have demonstrated outstanding results in image classification in the last few years. However, applying sophisticated neural network architectures in small datasets remains challenging. In this context, transfer learning is a promising approach for dealing with this scenario. Generally, the available pre-trained architectures adopt a standard fixed input, which usually implies resizing and cropping the input images in the preprocessing phase, causing information loss. Besides, images present visual features in different scales in real-world scenarios, and most common approaches do not consider this fact. In this paper, we propose an approach that applies transfer learning for dealing with small datasets and leverages visual features extracted by pre-trained models from different scales. We based our approach on graph convolutional networks (GCN) that take graphs representing the images in different scales as input and whose nodes are characterized by features extracted by pre-trained models from regular image patches of different scales. Since GCN can deal with graphs with different numbers of nodes, our approach can deal naturally with images of heterogeneous sizes without discarding relevant information. We evaluated our approach in two datasets: a set of geological images and a publicly available dataset, both presenting characteristics that challenge traditional approaches. We tested our approach by adopting three different pre-trained models as feature extractors: two efficient pre-trained CNN models (DenseNet and ResNeXt) and one Vision Transformer (CLIP). We compared our approach with two conventional approaches for dealing with image classification. The experiments show that our approach achieves better results than the conventional approaches for this task.

AB The evaluation and identification of high-quality patents are urgently needed for the technological research and development and the transformation of achievements. Traditional researchers and analysts mainly focus on developing various patent quality indicators.However, there is a lack of relative research on how to apply these indicators to comprehensively evaluate patent quality. Therefore, this paper uses the rough set theory(RST) and multidimensional cloud model(MCM) to construct a comprehensive evaluation and grading system for patent quality (RST-MCM), which is used to comprehensively evaluate the quality of patents. First, by systematically summarizing the relevant literature on patent quality evaluation, we identify the influencing factors of patent quality in multiple dimensions and at multiple stages. Second, the patent quality evaluation index system is constructed by using RST to reduce redundant patent quality influencing factors and determine the evaluation index weights. Finally, the evaluation and grading of patent quality is completed with MCM. To validate the effectiveness of the research, RST-MCM is applied to the quality evaluation of patents in the construction engineering industry. The research results show that the accuracy rate of RST-MCM is 90.3%. The research will provide effective decision-making support for the formulation of technical strategies such as improving independent innovation capability and patent layout.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; WINDOW APPROACH
AB Dynamic path planning has gained increasing popularity in mobile robot navigation. Some of the current path planning methods require a priori information about the motion space and are easily affected by the distribution of obstacles. To address the above limitation, this paper presents a novel dynamic method that transforms path planning into an optimal control problem and solves it dynamically through adaptive dynamic programming and artificial potential field. The proposed method can obtain optimal paths for a differentially driven mobile robot model in an unknown environment with many irregular obstacles. First, by combining path optimization and kinematical constraints of the mobile robot, the original problem is transformed into a new problem. Second, the total distance traveled, the effect of heading angle, the distance from the target to the robot, and the resultant force of the artificial potential field are included in the new performance index function. Third, the method based on adaptive dynamic programming is developed to avoid obstacles and guarantee the safety of autonomous navigation. The convergence analysis provides theoretical guarantees for our method, and the iterative control sequence will converge to the optimal control. Furthermore, simulation results and analyses under different complexity levels demonstrate that our method has promising performance in exploring and exploiting dynamic path planning problems.

AB The continuing prominence of machine learning has led to an increased focus on enhancing the inference performance of edge devices to reduce latency and improve efficiency. Two widely adopted strategies for accelerating computational performance are quantisation and the utilisation of AI hardware accelerators. Each type of accelerator or inference engine offers distinct advantages, with accelerators primarily designed to optimise neural network operations. In this paper, we present an innovative method for integrating TVM's quantisation flow with the MediaTek Neuropilot AI accelerator. We outline the process of converting the TVM relay intermediate-representation quantised neural network dialect model to a tensor-oriented quantisation format, with the aim of harnessing the full potential of both TVM and MediaTek NeuroPilot. This integration enables more efficient neural network inference while preserving the accuracy of the results. We assessed the effectiveness of our proposed integration by conducting a series of experiments and comparing the performance of our approach with that of TVM equipped with an autotuning mechanism. The findings indicate that our approach substantially outperforms TVM in both floating-point model inference and quantised model inference, with inference speedups of up to 11x and up to 70x, respectively. These results underscore the potential of our approach in accelerating AI performance across a diverse range of applications and edge devices. Moreover, a key contribution of our work is providing a valuable practical method for other hardware companies interested in integrating TVM with their own accelerators to achieve performance gains.

ID COMPILATION
AB Compiler optimization presents a formidable challenge, seeking to enhance code quality through various techniques. One significant obstacle is the phase-ordering problem, where the sequence of optimization algorithms can impact code quality and potentially lead to performance deterioration. While machine learning has shown promise in addressing this issue, it still encounters limitations in certain scenarios.Instruction Sink is a machine-independent optimization that segregates instructions like modulo and division into separate basic blocks. This separation prevents the application of the machine-dependent optimization called Division-Modulo Combine at the backend, which could otherwise lead to a decline in program performance. However, reordering these optimizations to avoid conflicts can prove to be challenging. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enhance Instruction Sink, resolving the blocking problem, and implements it within the LLVM optimizer. Leveraging the modularity of LLVM enables us to tackle all affected back-end issues simultaneously.To assess the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation focusing on feasibility, compatibility, and targeted improvements. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the blocking problem without conflicting with other optimization algorithms, solely impacting problematic instructions while leaving normal ones unaffected.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented growth and productivity in every socioeconomic sector. AI adoption in education is transformational through reduced teacher workload, individualized learning, intelligent tutors, profiling and prediction, high-precision education, collaboration, and learner tracking. This paper highlights the trajectory of AI research in higher education (HE) through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling approaches. We used the PRISMA guidelines to select 304 articles published in the Scopus database between 2012 and 2021. VOSviewer was used for visualization and text-mining to identify hotspots in the field. Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals distinct topics in the dynamic relationship between AI and HE. Only 9.6% of AI research in HE was achieved in the first seven years, with the last three years contributing 90.4%. China, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom dominated publications. Four themes emerged - data as the catalyst, the development of AI, the adoption of AI in HE and emerging trends and the future of AI in HE. Topic modeling on the abstracts revealed the 10 most frequent topics and the top 30 most salient terms. This research contributes to the literature by synthesizing AI adoption opportunities in HE, topic modeling and future research areas.

ID PARALLELIZATION; EVACUATION
AB The penaeid shrimp farming industry is experiencing rapid growth. To reduce costs and labour, automation techniques such as counting and size estimation are increasingly being adopted. Feeding based on the degree of stomach fullness can significantly reduce food waste and water contamination. Therefore, we propose an intelligent shrimp farming system that includes shrimp detection, measurement of approximated shrimp length, shrimp quantity, and two methods for determining the degree of digestive tract fullness. We introduce AR-YOLOv5 (Angular Rotation YOLOv5) in the system to enhance both shrimp growth and the environmental sustainability of shrimp farming. Our experiments were conducted in a real shrimp farming environment. The length and quantity are estimated based on the bounding box, and the level of stomach fullness is approximated using the ratio of the shrimp ' s digestive tract to its body size. In terms of detection performance, our proposed method achieves a precision rate of 97.70%, a recall rate of 91.42%, a mean average precision of 94.46%, and an F1-score of 95.42% using AR-YOLOv5. Furthermore, our stomach fullness determined method achieves an accuracy of 88.8%, a precision rate of 91.7%, a recall rate of 90.9%, and an F1-score of 91.3% in real shrimp farming environments.

AB The Dual-motor multi-gear coupling powertrain (DMCP) has the potential to improve transmission system efficiency and driving comfort, but its complex structure and multiple working modes present challenges. The switching between different modes is easy to cause longitudinal biggish vehicle jerk. To address these issues,this paper introduces the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm in the design of an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) that minimises total drive power consumption. And the number of working modes is divided and simplified. The process of switching dual motor and single motor to single motor is introduced in detail. The simulation results using AMESim and MATLAB show that the energy management strategy can effectively improve the economy, achieve no power interruption during mode switching, shift impact is less than 8m/s3, and output torque is remains stable.

DT Article
DE Generative adversarial networks; semantic image synthesis; attention;
   graph convolution
AB Although the existing semantic image synthesis methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success, the quality of the generated images still cannot achieve satisfactory results. This is mainly caused by two reasons. One reason is that the information in the semantic layout is sparse. Another reason is that a single constraint cannot effectively control the position relationship between objects in the generated image. To address the above problems, we propose a dual-conditional GAN with based on an external attention for semantic image synthesis (DCSIS). In DCSIS, the adaptive normalization method uses the one-hot encoded semantic layout to generate the first latent space and the external attention uses the RGB encoded semantic layout to generate the second latent space. Two latent spaces control the shape of objects and the positional relationship between objects in the generated image. The graph attention (GAT) is added to the generator to strengthen the relationship between different categories in the generated image. A graph convolutional segmentation network (GSeg) is designed to learn information for each category. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches, regarding both visual quality and the representative evaluating criteria.

DE Cross-domain recommendation; data sparsity; attention mechanism;

ID NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION; INFORMATION
AB Mapping-based cross-domain recommendation (CDR) can effectively tackle the cold-start problem in traditional recommender systems. However, existing mapping-based CDR methods ignore data-sparse users in the source domain, which may impact the transfer efficiency of their preferences. To this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Neighbor Interaction-based Personalized Transfer for Cross-Domain Recommendation (NIPT-CDR). This proposed method mainly contains two modules: (i) an intra-domain item supplementing module and (ii) a personalised feature transfer module. The first module introduces neighbour interactions to supplement the potential missing preferences for each source domain user, particularly for those with limited observed interactions. This approach comprehensively captures the preferences of all users. The second module develops an attention mechanism to guide the knowledge transfer process selectively. Moreover, a meta-network based on users' transferable features is trained to construct personalised mapping functions for each user. The experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed NIPT-CDR method achieves significant performance improvements compared to seven baseline models. The proposed model can provide more accurate and personalised recommendation services for cold-start users.

ID TEXT
AB Online reviews contain comparative opinions that reveal the competitive relationships of related products, help identify the competitiveness of products in the marketplace, and influence consumers' purchasing choices. The Class Sequence Rule (CSR) method, which is previously commonly used to identify the comparative relations of reviews, suffers from low recognition efficiency and inaccurate generation of rules. In this paper, we improve on the CSR method by proposing a hybrid CSR method, which utilises dependency relations and the part-of-speech to identify frequent sequence patterns in customer reviews, which can reduce manual intervention and reinforce sequence rules in the relation mining process. Such a method outperforms CSR and other CSR-based models with an F-value of 84.67%. In different experiments, we find that the method is characterised by less time-consuming and efficient in generating sequence patterns, as the dependency direction helps to reduce the sequence length. In addition, this method also performs well in implicit relation mining for extracting comparative information that lacks obvious rules. In this study, the optimal CSR method is applied to automatically capture the deeper features of comparative relations, thus improving the process of recognising explicit and implicit comparative relations.

AB As a foundation task of natural language processing, text classification is widely used in information retrieval, public opinion analysis, and other related tasks. Facing the problem of sparse features of Chinese short texts, which affects the classification accuracy of Chinese short texts, this paper proposes a Chinese short text classification method based on the Character Frequency Sub-word Enhancement (CFSE), which can effectively improve the classification accuracy of Chinese short texts. First, the initial Chinese-character sequence is mapped to the corresponding Character Frequency Sub-word (CFS) sequence based on the global character1 frequency information. Second, the relationship features among data are extracted based on BiLSTM-Att processing CFS sequence, and the semantic features of the initial Chinese-character sequence are obtained through ERNIE. Finally, these two kinds of features are fused and input into the text classifier to obtain the classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of Chinese short texts.

AB Due to the advantages of all-weather capability and high resolution, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image ship detection has been widely applied in the military, civilian, and other domains. However, SAR-based ship detection suffers from limitations such as strong scattering of targets, multiple scales, and background interference, leading to low detection accuracy. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel SAR ship detection method, NAS-YOLOX, which leverages the efficient feature fusion of the neural architecture search feature pyramid network (NAS-FPN) and the effective feature extraction of the multi-scale attention mechanism. Specifically, NAS-FPN replaces the PAFPN in the baseline YOLOX, greatly enhances the fusion performance of the model's multi-scale feature information, and a dilated convolution feature enhancement module (DFEM) is designed and integrated into the backbone network to improve the network's receptive field and target information extraction capabilities. Furthermore, a multi-scale channel-spatial attention (MCSA) mechanism is conceptualised to enhance focus on target regions, improve small-scale target detection, and adapt to multi-scale targets. Additionally, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, HRSID and SSDD, demonstrate that NAS-YOLOX achieves comparable or superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art ship detection models and reaches best accuracies of 91.1% and 97.2% on AP0.5, respectively.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION; INFORMATION
AB Reliable evaluation of damage in vehicles is a primary concern in the insurance industry. Consequently, solutions enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become the norm. During the assessment, precise damage segmentation plays a crucial role. Dent is a type of damage that can commonly occur in vehicles. It is difficult to pinpoint and tends to blend in with the background. This paper proposes a novel loss function to improve dent segmentation accuracy in vehicle insurance claims. Centre and Pixel-based Weighted DICE (CPW-DICE) is a loss function that performs pixel-based weighting. The CPW-DICE aims to concentrate on the centre of the dent damage to lessen faulty segmentations. CPW-DICE generates a weight mask during training by employing ground truth (GT) and prediction masks. Simultaneously, the weight mask is incorporated into DICE loss. Experiments conducted on our comprehensive internal dataset show a 3% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) score for three state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches compared to DICE loss. Finally, CPW-DICE is evaluated in similar tasks to demonstrate its benefits beyond car damage segmentation.

ID CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS
AB Contingency analysis (CA) is one of the essential tools for the optimal design and security assessment of a reliable power system. However, its computational requirements rise with the growth of distributed generations in the interconnected power system. As CA is a complex and computationally intensive problem, it requires a fast and accurate calculation to ensure the secure operation. Therefore, efficient mathematical modelling and parallel programming are key to efficient static security analysis. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm for static CA that uses both central processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs). To enhance the accuracy, AC load flow is used, and parallel computation of load flow is done simultaneously, with efficient screening and ranking of the critical contingencies. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. As a result, we establish that the proposed parallel algorithm with high-performance computing (HPC) computing is much faster than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, the HPC experiments were conducted using the national supercomputing facility, which demonstrates the proposed algorithm in the context of N-1 and N-2 static CA with immense power systems, such as the Indian northern regional power grid (NRPG) 246-bus and the polish 2383-bus networks.

AB With the increasing popularity of intelligence, many enterprises' warehouse inspection work is completed through robots. However, due to the multiple target points of warehouse inspection, the low efficiency of planning intelligent robot inspection paths is a problem that needs to be solved. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an HPSO-ACO algorithm based on hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) to optimize the parameters of the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, and establishes a path optimization model for intelligent inspection robots in warehouse management. Compared with HPSO algorithm and ACO algorithm, the experimental results show that the proposed method has faster convergence speed, fewer iterations, and shorter optimal path under the same conditions, which provides a theoretical reference for path optimization for inspection robot.

AB The patrol robot is an important guarantee for the safety of the enterprise's warehouse. However, due to the large number of patrol target points, the automatic path planning of the patrol robot is difficult and inefficient. In order to solve this problem, the hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm is combined with A-star algorithm, and a path optimization method for inspection robot based on HPSO-A-star model is proposed. First, the grid model of the map is established, A-star algorithm calculates the path between two inspection points, and then HPSO algorithm realizes the nonlinear planning of the path according to the length of different paths, so as to find an optimal inspection route. The comparative experimental analysis results show that the path planned by HPSO algorithm is 5.71% shorter than that planned by PSO algorithm; the smaller the map grid size is, the shorter the calculated optimal path length is, but it will consume more computing resources. Finally, the HPSO-A-star algorithm is compared with the PSO-A-star algorithm; the experimental results show that the path of the HPSO-A-star algorithm is shortened by 29.79%, and the HPSO-A-star algorithm can better realize the path planning of the patrol robot.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an emerging military and civilian technology that uses sensors. Sensor networks are hierarchical and chaotic in remote, unmonitored sites. Wireless sensor networks pose unique security threats due to their public location and wireless transmission. WSNs are vulnerable to various routing attacks, including Black holes, Sybil, sinkholes and wormholes. In this paper, we proposed advanced intrusion detection systems based on hybrid machine learning (AIDS-HML) in wireless sensor networks to identify and classify attacks. Hybrid machine learning classifiers identify wireless sensor network dangers. Benchmark datasets are used to compare the proposed model to baseline models in terms of precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. The scheme is trained and evaluates prediction models. This confirms that the detection accuracy achieved 99.80% using the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset based on hybrid random forest and extreme gradient boost (RF-XGB). The hybrid cluster labelling K-Means (CLK-M) s achieved better classification accuracy of 100% using UNSW_NB15, and CICIDS2017 benchmark datasets for binary classification of label attacks. Different attack detection metrics were compared against various benchmark datasets to evaluate the quality of this work. The proposed system is efficient in simulations for feature extraction and route discovery and detection attacks achieving an accuracy of 99.46%.

AB Despite the extensive deployment of digital instruments in modern times, their stability is challenging to maintain in adverse environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, pressure, or powerful electromagnetic radiation. Analog meters, owing to their mechanical resilience and electromagnetic impedance, persistently find usage across nuclear power plants, petroleum, and chemical industries. However, under these harsh conditions, manual reading of the instruments may prove to be difficult and dangerous while failing to meet the requirements of real-time monitoring. In recent years, several machine vision-based meter reading systems have been proposed, however, achieving high accuracy through camera-based methods under varying angles and lighting conditions poses significant challenges. Cloud deployment may compromise plant privacy, while edge computing faces limitations in real-time meter reading due to limited computing power. To address these issues, we propose a real-time reading system based on the YolactEdge instance segmentation framework for single-point analog meters. Our system is more accurate than previous studies and is implemented and deployed on the Jetson Xavier NX edge computing device. Our performance evaluation shows that our model outperforms other baselines, with low reference values and relative errors of 0.0237% and 0.0300%, respectively, and an average inference speed of 10.26 FPS with INIT 8 linear acceleration on Nvidia Jetson NX.

AB In the real world, the spread of various epidemics can be modelled using the SEIR disease transmission model. Early detection and prevention of susceptible individuals is an effective method of controlling the spread of infectious viruses. This paper presents a study that detects susceptible community on a hospital contact network, which encompasses patients, nurses, doctors and managers. The goal of our work is to identify susceptible communities with patients and healthcare workers, and analyse the independent contact networks of various roles to determine the high-influence nodes within the hospital contact network. If these high-influence nodes are part of the susceptible community, they should be the focus of observation to prevent the spread of the virus. The proposed model combines social network analysis method and machine learning method with the disease transmission model. This study employs the classic overlapping community detection method CPM for community detection and the PageRank algorithm to rank node influence. The experimental results, obtained from real-world hospital contact networks over a 4-day period, demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.

AB With the rapid growth of Internet data traffic, the means of malicious attack become more diversified. The single modal intrusion detection model cannot fully exploit the rich feature information in the massive network traffic data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal hybrid parallel network intrusion detection model (MHPN). The proposed model extracts network traffic features from two modalities: the statistical information of network traffic and the original load of traffic, and constructs appropriate neural network models for each modal information. Firstly, a two-branch convolutional neural network is combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the spatio-temporal feature information of network traffic from the original load mode of traffic, and a convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature information of traffic statistics. Then, the feature information extracted from the two modalities is fused and fed to the CosMargin classifier for network traffic classification. The experimental results on the ISCX-IDS 2012 and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets show that the MHPN model outperforms the single-modal models and achieves an average accuracy of 99.98 % . The model also demonstrates strong robustness and a positive sample recognition rate.

ID NETWORKS
AB Automated decision-making techniques play a crucial role in data science, AI, and general machine learning. However, such techniques need to balance accuracy with computational complexity, as their solution requirements are likely to need exhaustive analysis of the potentially numerous events combinations, which constitute the corresponding scenarios. Intuition is an essential tool in the identification of solutions to problems. More specifically, it can be used to identify, combine and discover knowledge in a "parallel" manner, and therefore more efficiently. As a consequence, the embedding of artificial intuition within data science is likely to provide novel ways to identify and process information. There is extensive research on this topic mainly based on qualitative approaches. However, due to the complexity of this field, limited quantitative models and implementations are available. In this article, the authors have extended the evaluation to include a real-world, multi-disciplinary area in order to provide a more comprehensive assessment. The results demonstrate the value of artificial intuition, when embedded in decision-making and information extraction models and frameworks. In fact, the output produced by the approach discussed in their article was compared with a similar task carried out by a group of experts in the field. This demonstrates comparable results further showing the potential of this framework, as well as artificial intuition as a tool for decision-making and information extraction.

AB Food-oriented cross-modal retrieval aims to retrieve relevant recipes given food images or vice versa. The modality semantic gap between recipes and food images (text and image modalities) is the main challenge. Though several studies are introduced to bridge this gap, they still suffer from two major limitations: 1) The simple embedding concatenation only can capture the simple interactions rather than complex interactions between different recipe components. 2) The image feature extraction based on convolutional neural networks only considers the local features and ignores the global features of an image, as well as the interactions between different extracted features. This paper proposes a novel method based on Latent Component Weight Factors and Global Information (LCWF-GI) to learn the robust recipe and image representations for food-oriented cross-modal retrieval. This proposed method integrates the textual embeddings of different recipe components into a compact embedding to represent the recipes with the latent component-specific weight factors. A transformer encoder is utilised to capture the intra-modality interactions and the importance of different extracted image features for enhanced image representations. Finally, the bi-directional triplet loss is further used to perform retrieval learning. Experimental results on the Recipe 1M dataset show that our LCWF-GI method achieves competent improvements.

AB This paper proposes a particle-based nonlinear elastic object simulation technique for virtual surgery. Particle-based techniques are used to model and simulate nonlinear elastic objects, such as the skin and internal organs. This enables the simulation to consider various factors, such as location, direction, and depth, when making incisions in the organs. However, the issue with this method is that it can only simulate precisely cut tissue during incision. Objects with elasticity, such as tissue, require the generation of complex debris during incision. This paper proposes a particle-based elastic object simulation technique to model the debris from torn tissue when making an incision in the organs. It can predict where the tissue will tear based on the maximum shear stress (MSS) theory and Tresca's yield criterion when the force applied to the tissue exceeds the maximum stress. Newly generated particles at the predicted location are remeshed with nearby particles. We verified the superiority of our proposed method over traditional particle-based methods by accurately representing more complex debris and comparing the results of incisions in the same area of the body. This allows various incision types, such as stab wounds and lacerations, to be simulated.

AB The healthcare industry is collecting considerable patient and medical data by using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Consequently, ransomware attacks to encrypt healthcare systems or leak such data have increased recently. Many studies are aiming to predict ransomware behaviours early to protect the healthcare IoT environment from such attacks. However, previous studies analysed ransomware behaviours for long periods of time, and systems would already get infected and encrypted meanwhile. To avoid this problem, this study proposes an early prediction scheme of ransomware behaviour (EPS-Ran) to reduce the likelihood of systems being infected during behavioural analysis. EPS-Ran analyses behaviours for 30 s to extract the opcode and API calls sequence. The extracted behaviour features are entered into a hybrid deep learning model that combines the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) model and the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model to predict a future 90 s API calls sequence. The MAE, MSE, and RMSE of the prediction performance of EPS-Ran were measured to be 0.3438, 0.5648, and 0.6342, respectively. EPS-Ran predicted ransomware behaviours early with a low error rate even when the analysis time was reduced from 120 s to 30 s.

AB Although machine learning classifiers have been successfully used in the medical and engineering fields, there is still room for improving the predictive accuracy of model classification. The higher the accuracy of the classifier, the better suggestions can be provided for the decision makers. Therefore, in this study, we propose an ensemble machine learning approach, called Feature generation-based Ensemble Support Vector Machine (FESVM), for classification tasks. We first apply the feature selection technique to select the most related features. Next, we introduce an ensemble strategy to aggregate multiple base estimators for the final prediction using the meta-classifier SVM. During this stage, we use the classification probabilities obtained from the base classifier to generate new features. After that, the generated features are added to the original data set to form a new data set. Finally, this new data set is utilised to train the meta-classifier SVM to obtain the final classification results. For example, for a binary classification task, each base classifier has two probabilities (p for one class and 1-p for the other class). In this case, two new features are generated from the combination of probabilities based on these base classifiers. One is the sum of p as new feature 1, and the other is the sum of 1-p as new feature 2. These two new features are then added to the original data set to form the new data set. In the same way, our feature generation method can be easily extended for a multi-class task for generating new features, where the number of features depends on the number of classes. Those generated features from the base estimators (first layer) are added to the original data set to form a new data set. This new data set is used as the input to the second layer (meta-classifier) to obtain the final model. Experiments based on the 20 data sets show that our proposed model FESVM has the best performance compared to the other machine learning classifiers under comparison. In addition, our FESVM has better performance than the original stacking method in the multi-class classification tasks. Statistical results based on the Wilcoxon-Holm method also confirms that our FESVM can significantly outperform the other models. These indicate that our FESVM can be a useful tool for classification tasks, especially multi-classification tasks.

AB Through social media platforms and the internet, the world is becoming more and more connected, and producing enormous amounts of data. Also, the texts are collected from social media, newspapers, user reviews of products, company press releases, etc. The correctness of the classification is mainly dependent on the kind of words utilised in the corpus and the features utilised for classification. Hence, due to the increasing growth of text data on the Internet, the accurate organisation and management of text data has become a great challenge. Hence, in this research, an effective Invasive Weed Tunicate Swarm Optimization-based Hierarchical Attention Network (IWTSO-based HAN) is implemented for achieving categorisation of text. Here, the features are mined from the text and thereby the optimal features are acquired to perform the classification strategy. The incorporation of parametric features of each optimisation ensures the proposed method to increase the convergence of global solutions by improving the categorisation effectiveness. The proposed method obtained better performance for text classification with measures, like accuracy, True Positive Rate (TRP), True Negative Rate (TNR), precision, and False Negative Rate (FNR) with values of 92.4%, 92.4%, 94.1%, 95.4%, and 0.0758.

AB Node importance evaluation is a hot issue in complex network analysis. Existing node importance evaluation methods are mainly oriented to homogeneous networks, which ignore the heterogeneity of node types and edges. We propose an MLN critical node evaluation method based on graph convolution. In this paper, we generate the feature matrix of nodes. Considering the diversity of node types in the network, we design an adapted node sampling method based on the meta path. An MLN node embedding model is constructed based on a graph convolutional network (MGC). Besides, the negative sampling technique is used to complete MGC training. Metrics of critical node evaluation are constructed by combining the node embedding vectors and local structural features to evaluate the node's importance. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better evaluation accuracy than the K-Shell algorithm (K-Shell), K-shell-based gravity model ranking algorithm (KSDG), the Page Rank algorithm in MLN (PR), influence maximization based on network embedding (IMNE) and the node ranking algorithm based on information entropy (ERM).

AB Third-party APIs have been widely used to develop various applications. As the number of third-party APIs grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to quickly find suitable APIs that meet users' requirements. Inspired by recommender systems, API recommendation methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, previous API recommendation methods are insufficient in utilising the high-order interactions between users and APIs, and thus have limited performance. Based on the model of lightweight graph convolutional neural network, this paper proposes an effective API recommendation method by exploiting both low-order and high-order interactions between users and APIs. It first learns the embedding of users and APIs from the user-API interaction graph, and then adopts a weighted summation operator to aggregate the embeddings learned from different propagation layers for API recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real dataset with 160,309 API users and 21,031 Web APIs, and the results show that our method has significantly better precision and recall than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In the age of big data, recipe recommendation is of great significance. It can recommend recipes in line with the user's eating habits in massive data. Compared with other recommendation tasks, recipe recommendation is influenced by multiple aspects and requires fine-grained learning to obtain entity representations. Therefore, the traditional recommendation method cannot meet people's requirements. In this paper, we propose the Collaborative Knowledge Propagation Graph Attention Network for Recipes Recommendation (CGRS). This method designs collaborative information propagation to make full use of user interaction and recipe attribute information to meet the needs of multiple influencing factors. Use the graph attention feature learning network to obtain the high-order feature information of the entity to meet the demand for fine-grained representation. Specifically, the method first obtains the multi-hop triplet sets of users and recipes through a collaborative message propagation strategy. Then utilises a graph attention feature learning layer to learn the topological proximity structure features of the triplet sets. Obtain high-level semantic information of entities by superimposing network layers. Design an attention aggregator at the prediction layer to refine the embedding representation of entities. Finally predict the user-recipe interaction probability. Experimental results prove the advancement and effectiveness of CGRS.

AB Nowadays, mobile robots are being widely employed in various settings, including factories, homes, and everyday tasks. Achieving successful implementation of autonomous robot movement largely depends on effective route planning. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a growing trend in studying and improving the intelligence of this technology. Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in decision-making problems and can be effectively utilized to address path planning challenges faced by mobile robots. This manuscript focuses on investigating path planning problems using deep reinforcement learning and multi-sensing information fusion technology. The manuscript elaborates on the significance of path planning, providing comprehensive research encompassing path planning algorithms, deep reinforcement learning, and multi-sensing information fusion. Also, the fundamental theory of deep reinforcement learning is introduced, followed by the design of a multimodal perception module based on image and lidar. A semantic segmentation approach is employed to bridge the gap between simulated and real environments. To enhance strategy, a lightweight multimodal data fusion network model is carefully developed, incorporating modality separation learning. Overall, in this paper, we explore the use of a deep reinforcement learning architecture for conducting path planning experiments with mobile robots. The results obtained from these experiments demonstrate promising outcomes.

DT Article
AB In recent years, motion recognition has become a hot research topic in the field of computer vision and has great research worth. Scholars and research institutions at home and abroad have made a lot of research and achieved good results. However, the research results of applying motion recognition technology to dance video are relatively few, mainly because the complexity of human motion in dance video is relatively high. In article, an optimized design scheme for motion recognition research of dance video based on computer vision and image processing is proposed. The collected dance video is preprocessed, including grayscale, background subtraction and filter denoising, so as to extract the character features in the video image. Then, the method of self-organizing mapping neural network (SOM) in computer vision is used to realize the recognition of dance movements. Finally, the simulation test and analysis are carried out. The simulation results show that the proposed arithmetic has a certain accuracy, which is 9.34% higher than the traditional arithmetic. The research of motion recognition method based on dance video will also play a certain reference role for the research of human motion recognition in a large number of real and complex environments, and enrich the application field of motion recognition technology.

AB MISRA-C is a writing specification for the C programming language defined by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA). It establishes a set of rules to enhance the development of software that is safe, reliable, and portable. MISRA-C is widely adopted by industries such as aerospace, defense and security, telecommunications, and medical device manufacturers. We developed a static detector of code's compliance with MISRA-C's single-translation-unit rules. The code checker is based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This paper describes the strategies underlying the detector's design and implementation. For the tested benchmarks, the proposed checker is demonstrated to correctly assess compliance with or violation of all single-translation-unit rules. It can also obtain more accurate and more complete results than Cppcheck, a popular open-source checker. The source code can be downloaded from .

ID AVERAGE RUN-LENGTH
AB This research aims to derive the average run length (ARL) evaluation of the double exponentially weighted moving average (double EWMA) control chart for observation data that follows exponential white noise in a time series model with an autoregressive model. Since most real-world data is automatically correlated, autoregressive models are available. Comparisons were made between the ARLs obtained using the explicit formula and the numerical integral equation (NIE) approach. The results showed that the explicit formula's use of the ARL outperformed the NIE approach in terms of computation time. After that, the efficacy of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and double EWMA charts is then compared using the suggested explicit ARL formula. The ARL of the double EWMA chart was found to perform better than the ARL of the EWMA chart in all situations. It also uses natural gas and diesel prices on stock exchanges around the world as cases studies. The results show that the double EWMA chart has better detection sensitivity than the EWMA chart, and the results are consistent with the experimental results. As a result, the sensitivity of the double EWMA chart in detecting changes makes it a good alternative for monitoring processes with real-world data.

ID BIM; SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB Building Information Modeling (BIM) has emerged as a transformative technology in the construction industry, revolutionizing various aspects of the field. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with BIM holds significant promise and is gaining momentum in interdisciplinary applications. In China, the construction industry has witnessed notable advancements through the convergence of BIM, AI, and cloud data. However, the current state of intelligent construction technology in China reveals certain limitations that hinder its comprehensive development. This study addresses these challenges by focusing on the design of intelligent recognition algorithms for monitoring structural damage during bridge construction. Previous research has primarily employed classical neural network algorithms, but these approaches have exhibited certain limitations. This paper proposes innovative improvement measures to overcome these limitations and demonstrates their effectiveness through practical arithmetic examples. Furthermore, to enhance the intelligence level of the BIM system, this study integrates the improved neural network recognition algorithm into the BIM framework. The integration enables the BIM system to recognize and assess bridge structure damage efficiently and accurately. The outcomes of this research provide valuable insights into advancing the field of intelligent construction technology, particularly in the context of bridge construction monitoring.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB The rapid digital revolution in recent decades has resulted in an overwhelming amount of information, particularly in the realm of modern education systems and related materials. This phenomenon, often referred to as information overload, necessitates the development of educational systems that can effectively search, classify, and categorize this vast amount of available information. Of utmost importance for such educational information systems is the safeguarding of personal data, which refers to information that can identify an individual or their family. School records, for example, contain various types of personal data such as the individual's name, address, contact details, disciplinary history, as well as their grades and progress checks. Even if individuals choose to make this data public, it remains inherently personal. Another category of data involves more sensitive topics such as student biometrics (e.g. fingerprints, photographs), religious beliefs, health information (e.g. allergies), or dietary restrictions, which may imply religious or health-related aspects. Processing data in this category can pose risks to individuals; hence, strict rules and appropriate consent are necessary to ensure their protection. To address these challenges, this research paper proposes a zero-knowledge proof intelligent recommendation system designed to protect students' data privacy in the digital age. The proposed method incorporates an Intelligent Recommendation System (IRS) that utilizes an optimized version of the Matrix Factorization technique, calculated as an Eulerian Walk chart. Furthermore, the Schnorr Zero-Knowledge Proof format, based on the discrete logarithm problem, ensures the privacy of personal data during message exchange between educational entities.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Crowdsourcing takes advantage of human intelligence to solve complex problems that computers cannot handle. People actively participate in computational tasks for rewards, especially those that are relatively simple for humans but challenging for computers. However, most traditional crowdsourcing systems must rely on a central organisation to handle the work associated with crowdsourcing. This may lead to privacy and security issues such as information leakage, single point of attack and unfair judgement. Meanwhile, the high service fees of existing central crowdsourcing platforms will reduce people's motivation to participate in crowdsourcing tasks. Consequently, PrivBCS is proposed in this paper, a blockchain-based decentralised crowdsourcing system that does not rely on third-party agencies and requires only low transaction fees. In this paper, PrivBCS protects the confidentiality of crowdsourcing data and the identity privacy of participants by cryptographic means, such as Paillier, El-Gamal and CPABE. It selects the most suitable worker to perform tasks by setting access control policies on task data and matching workers' attributes while ensuring the anonymity of workers' identity. Considering that the data volume of crowdsourcing tasks may be large and there is a certain upper limit to the block capacity of the blockchain, an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage scheme is proposed, which can increase the throughput of the blockchain system and improve its scalability to a certain extent. In PrivBCS, we implement the transaction process of crowdsourcing tasks through smart contracts. The experimental results and security analysis in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and feasibility of PrivBCS.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Risk management is essential to every organization's management plan. It is the strategy by which organizations handle the risks involved with their actions to profit or avoid making decisions that will cost them financially in each activity. Identifying and mitigating potential digital threats and developing and implementing procedures to significantly reduce the likelihood of an organization being targeted by cyberattacks are at the core of effective risk management. This is especially true regarding the risks associated with an organization's digital footprint. A particularly significant threat to reputation, but also at the same time indirect and direct costs, is the data breach that occurs when a security incident occurs about the data for which the organization is responsible, which results in a violation of confidentiality, availability, or the integrity of the data it manages. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology has transformed the agricultural industry, allowing for large-scale farming based on machine learning and other advanced tools. However, this transformation also exposes farms to cyber risks that can lead to costly data breaches. In this study, we propose a framework for incorporating explainable machine learning (exML) techniques into large-scale farming to enhance cyber risk analysis, mitigate cyber threats, and foster a sustainable rural economy. Specifically, given that an organization needs to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to avoid possible data breaches, this work presents an analytical stochastic modeling of risk with a multi-criteria objective function of low complexity, a factor in an incentive system, to model investment value and cost balancing. The motivation behind the proposed method is to improve cybersecurity, protect data and reputation, foster a sustainable rural economy, leverage explainable machine learning, and adapt to the changing technological landscape. By addressing these motivations, the method aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to cyber risk analysis in large-scale farming.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; POSE ESTIMATION
AB Whether a basketball player's movements are standard or not is a key indicator to evaluate a basketball player and a key point for basketball player training. In order to improve the training effect of basketball players, effective and fast accurate recognition of basketball players' action trajectories is crucial. In order to solve the problems of inadequate extraction of limb action features and loss of detail information due to multiple scales of limb action features caused by traditional recognition algorithms, an action trajectory recognition algorithm based on the improved EfficientDet-D0 is proposed. The algorithm firstly adds a spatial attention mechanism in the backbone network of EfficientDet-D0, where can locate the limb action trajectory features in the image more accurately. Secondly, in the feature fusion network, in order to describe the high-frequency detail information lost by downsampling, the idea of Laplace pyramid is used to fuse the detail feature maps in the top-down fusion path, and cross-level connections are added to make full use of the feature information of different resolutions, so that the acquired high-level feature map information is richer. Finally, the whole network is trained using the migration learning technique and Adam optimizer. The experimental results show that the model achieves a PCP value (percentage correct parts) of 95.6% on the upper limb pose dataset and takes only 5.34 s for 1000 tests. Compared with the traditional algorithm, it has a higher accuracy rate and stronger robustness, with strong practical applicability, realizing the effective and accurate recognition of basketball players' upper limb action trajectories in real time.

AB Since the full implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy in the country, all regions and departments have placed great emphasis on the work of mass entrepreneurship and innovation, resulting in a significant increase in innovation and entrepreneurship. The national focus on mass entrepreneurship and innovation has shifted from quantitative to qualitative improvements, with greater attention being paid to improving substance rather than expanding scope. There is a growing trend among colleges to recognize innovation and entrepreneurial management as a significant achievement in college education and teaching. By prioritizing innovation and entrepreneurship management and professional education, the aim is to cultivate college students with an entrepreneurial spirit, and to develop inventive and entrepreneurial talent. Cultivating innovative talent is one way to apply the innovation-driven development plan and build a creative country. However, the implementation of the innovation and entrepreneurship development plan in the country has posed both new opportunities and challenges to the management of innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges across the country. As a result, innovation and entrepreneurship have become increasingly important tasks that can help improve the management of innovation and entrepreneurship in these institutions. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a neural network for evaluating innovation and entrepreneurship management methods in colleges, which combines convolutional neural networks with these tasks. Specifically, a multi-scale convolutional neural network is designed to more efficiently extract innovation and entrepreneurship management features in colleges, ultimately leading to improved model performance.

DE Sparse measurement technique; high column coherence; subspace-based

ID ACCURATE
AB Traffic matrices (TMs) are essential for managing networks. Getting the whole TMs is difficult because of the high measurement cost. Several recent studies propose sparse measurement schemes to reduce the cost, which involve taking measurements on only a subset of origin and destination pairs (OD pairs) and inferring data for unmeasured OD pairs through matrix completion. However, existing sparse network measurement schemes suffer from the problems of high computation costs and low recovery quality. This paper investigates the coherence feature of real traffic flow data traces (Abilene and GEANT). Both data sets are high coherence, with column coherence greater than row coherence. According to the coherence feature of both data sets, we propose our Redundant Row Subspace-based Matrix Completion (RRS-MC). RRS-MC involves several techniques. Firstly, we design an algorithm to identify subspace rows (OD pairs) from historical data. Secondly, based on the identified subspace rows, we design our sampling scheduling algorithm, which takes full measurement samples in subspace rows while taking partial measurement samples in the remaining rows. Moreover, we propose a redundant sampling rule prevent the recovery accuracy decrease caused by the subspace rows varying. Finally, we design a completion algorithm to recover the partially measured rows. We conduct extensive experiments. Results indicate that the proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art sampling and completion scheme in computation costs and recovery accuracy.

AB This paper presents MoCoUTRL: a Momentum Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Text Representation Learning. This model improves two aspects of recently popular contrastive learning algorithms in natural language processing (NLP). Firstly, MoCoUTRL employs multi-granularity semantic contrastive learning objectives, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic features of samples. Secondly, MoCoUTRL uses a dynamic dictionary to act as the approximately ground-truth representation for each token, providing the pseudo labels for token-level contrastive learning. The MoCoUTRL can extend the use of pre-trained language models (PLM) and even large-scale language models (LLM) into a plug-and-play semantic feature extractor that can fuel multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results on several publicly available datasets and further theoretical analysis validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method in this paper.

AB As both economies and trade broadly globalize, cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) as a branch of international trade has shown great potential for development. The construction of a CBEC realizes the integration and utilization of resources between the CBEC trading platform as the core element and other components of the system, cross-border logistics, payment enterprises, suppliers, and demanders, and improves the overall economic benefits. A model of economic progress at the expense of the environment emerges in the radical development of companies that do not consider the environment and simply earn high incomes at the cost of consuming resources. In this context, it is of great theoretical and empirical importance to examine how to improve the production efficiency of the CBEC supply chain, improve ecological quality and realize the production mode of "low input, high output, and low pollution." In this study, we evaluate the green development of the CBEC industry and study the factors that affect its efficiency level. According to the results of influencing factors, this paper mainly uses the random forest algorithm and panel Tobit approach to investigate the affecting attributes of environmental efficiency and suggest policies to improve the green progression efficiency of the CBEC industry.

ID DESIGN; ENERGY
AB The global tobacco industry has made significant strides in reducing the harmful emissions of tobacco by focusing on the development of non-burning cigarette products. Among these innovations, electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets have garnered attention. However, one of the challenges faced by these products is the reliance on empirical values for temperature control, resulting in subpar taste and low production rates. To address these issues, this research introduces an optimization strategy that utilizes advanced algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and traditional non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). By leveraging these algorithms, this study aims to optimize the performance of electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets. The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive review of relevant literature and the systematic introduction of a simulation method. Through the proposed approach, a finite element model verification is conducted, which demonstrates a minimal maximum relative error between the model values of the objective function and the simulation values of the optimized parameters. As a result, this multi-objective optimization approach proves to be highly effective in enhancing the performance of electromagnetic cigarette heaters. It not only addresses the taste and production rate issues associated with existing electrically heated noncombustible cigarette smoking sets but also provides a scientifically grounded method for optimizing these devices. This research paves the way for further advancements in the tobacco industry, contributing to the development of safer and more satisfying alternatives to traditional cigarettes.

AB Lung cancer is the most common and second leading cause of cancer with lowest survival rate due to lack of efficient diagnostic tools. Currently, researchers are devising artificial intelligence based tools to improve the diagnostic capabilities. The machine learning (ML) requires hand-crafted features to train the algorithms. To extract most relevant features is still a challenging task in the field image processing. We first extracted the texture gray level co-occurrence matrix features. We fed these features to traditional ML algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The SVM yielded an accuracy of 83.0%, whereas KNN produced an accuracy of 97.0%. We then optimized and employed the ensemble extreme boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which improved the detection performance with precision, recall, and accuracy of 100%. We also optimized and employed the deep learning ResNet101 to distinguish the small cell cancer from non-small cell lung cancer and obtained the 100% performance with these evaluation performance measures. The results revealed that proposed approach is more robust than traditional ML algorithms. Based on these results, the proposed methodology can be very helpful in the early detection and treatment of lung cancer for better diagnosis system.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB As one of the most serious hazards in the world, more than 80% of traffic accidents are caused by driver misconduct. The detection of abnormal behavior of drivers is important to improve safety in public transportation. The anomaly measurement is not only determined by objective rules such as laws, but also distinguished due to the biological characteristics. The same driving behavior may present completely opposite judgment results for different categories of drivers. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method that measures the preference path length of drivers for various driving operations via pheromones, and identifies abnormal driving behavior by calculating the cumulative conversion probability of operation switching. An improved ant colony algorithm based on fixed point simplicial theory is proposed to improve the convergence efficiency by optimizing the initial population state. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect abnormal driving behavior and significantly reduce false alarms.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing college popular music education by incorporating an elite teaching optimization algorithm into a customized model. A key feature of the proposed model is the utilization of a high-fidelity wideband audio coding algorithm, which employs a time-frequency analysis module based on the MDCT fast algorithm to reduce storage requirements. The psychoacoustic analysis module takes advantage of the high frequency domain resolution of FFT and accounts for differences between MDCT and DFT by calculating masking curves separately. The proposed model is evaluated using the elite teaching optimization algorithm, and results demonstrate that it effectively improves the effectiveness of college popular music education.

AB The urgent and indispensable requirement for secure and efficient remote work compels organizations to reconsider their approach to safeguarding themselves against cyber threats. The shift toward remote work amplifies the need to redirect more network traffic toward cloud-based applications rather than relying solely on the internal network. The growing adoption of the hybrid work model necessitates system administrators to increasingly provide access to applications and services beyond the conventional boundaries of enterprise networks. Ensuring privacy goes beyond mere compliance with regulations; it is crucial for demonstrating transparency and accountability, which are essential in building trust with stakeholders. Employing a zero-trust approach can proactively enhance privacy by implementing access controls based on the principle of least privilege and predefined purposes. Such an approach helps to limit potential damages and enhances the resilience of complex information systems. This work proposes an innovative privacy-preserving and zero-trust computational intelligent hybrid system. Building upon the zero-trust architecture, this system ensures a protected environment while preserving privacy. It achieves this by employing multi-level trust fields within a corporate network, where every access request undergoes comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption before being granted access. The system's efficacy is validated within a sports training application environment, with stringent authorization requirements and the corresponding need to safeguard personal privacy. By implementing the proposed system, the application environment can effectively mitigate privacy risks while providing secure access only to authorized individuals. The hybrid system's computational intelligence further enhances its ability to adapt to evolving threats and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. In summary, the current landscape of remote work necessitates organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and privacy. By embracing a zero-trust approach and implementing the privacy-preserving and zero-trust computational intelligent hybrid system, organizations can ensure robust protection, maintain privacy compliance, and establish a trusted foundation for remote work environments.

AB At a new historical crossroads, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a major measure to coordinate sustained economic growth at home, maintain a peaceful and stable environment in the surrounding region, and foster regional economic and commercial cooperation in the region. The BRI, a major initiative, can not only drive national economic growth but also has far-reaching significance for promoting world economic prosperity and peace. The national plan clearly pointed out that in the face of the new international pattern and situation, China should improve its new opening-up system and promote construction for the BRI in the future. In this context, research on the benefits and security issues for foreign investment under the BRI has become an important topic. This work combines it with artificial intelligence to propose a neural network (IPSO-DBN) for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Chinese outbound investment. First, this work applies DBN to evaluate the benefits and security for outbound investment under the BRI. This work introduces a policy of linearly decreasing weights and an adaptive learning factor into the PSO algorithm to construct IPSO. Then, the IPSO is utilized to optimize initial weights for DBN, and the problem of initial weights are random and easy to fall local optimal solution is improved to construct IPSO-DBN. Second, this work puts forward a series of suggestions for Chinese enterprises to invest abroad in response to the current investment problems under the BRI Third, this work has carried out various experiments on IPSO-DBN and Chinese enterprises' foreign investment proposals, and the experimental results have verified the feasibility of the method designed in this work.

AB Asset price jumps are very common in financial markets, and they are essential to accurately predict volatility. This article focuses on 50 randomly selected stocks from the Chinese stock market, utilising high-frequency data to construct two jump models, the heterogeneous autoregressive quarticity jump model (HARQ-J) and the full heterogeneous autoregressive quarticity jump model (HARQ-F-J), which take into account jump variables based on existing models (HARQ and HARQ-F). To further enhance the accuracy of our volatility forecasts, the study combines the newly constructed models with the machine learning (ML) to form a hybrid model. Finally, the empirical research shows that the new hybrid model performs better than existing traditional prediction methods. In particular, the long- and short-term memory (LSTM) function is significantly better than other machine learning functions. Among all the LSTM models tested by the model confidence set (MCS), the HARQ-F-J-LSTM model has the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the HARQ-J-LSTM model.

AB Cloud data auditing is essential to ensure the integrity of cloud data. The main idea of cloud auditing is to entrust the audit task to a third-party auditor (TPA) with powerful computing ability. However, TPA may lead to data leakage and become the single point of failure. Recently, blockchain has been introduced to solve these problems by TPA. However, the dynamic storage structure developed by traditional cloud storage does not apply to the blockchain. This paper proposes a blockchain-based collaborative public auditing scheme for dynamic data. We design the cloud service provider(CSP) to generate a challenge set using the latest block hash. It does not need to interact with the blockchain in the challenge phase, dramatically reducing communication overhead. In addition, considering economic factors, we allow users to seek partners to reduce audit costs. The EigenTrust model evaluates the reputation of each user's audit behaviour, effectively avoiding the probability of malicious users participating.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data profoundly impact people's way of life and way of thinking, and college ideological and political education (IPE) has gradually entered the era of online education. On account of this, this study designs an online education algorithm based on AI technology to help teachers better understand the situation of students' online IPE teaching and improve the management of IPE in universities. Firstly, the learning features of students are extracted through the Back Propagation Neural Network (BP) model. This model summarizes the shortcomings of feature extraction in machine learning, and can simultaneously obtain depth information from the signals of multiple sensors, thus increasing the overall algorithm classification accuracy. Secondly, combined with the human behavior recognition model, the status and behavior of students' IPE teaching can be obtained in real-time from students' listening devices. Finally, the algorithm's classification performance is evaluated by experiments and compared with the designed model. The results reveal that the recognition accuracy of the designed classification algorithms for the sample students is 98.59%, 98.99%, 99.21%, 100%, 97.10%, 95.61%, and 100%, respectively. In addition, comparing the algorithm with similar recognition algorithms, its index values of accuracy and precision are 97.83% and 97.82%, respectively, which are better than similar classification algorithms. Finally, through the experimental samples, the accuracy of the human recognition model is tested and compared with other recognition models. The results reveal that the designed model has high recognition accuracy. This study is of great significance for improving teachers' innovative IPE methods and optimizing the management level of online IPE teaching.

AB Computer technology has had a significant impact on the field of education, and its use in classrooms has facilitated the spread of knowledge and has helped students become well-rounded citizens. However, as the number of users accessing wireless networks for computer-based learning continues to grow, the scarcity of spectrum resources has become more apparent, which makes it crucial to find intelligent methods to improve spectrum utilization in wireless networks. Dynamic spectrum access is a critical technology in wireless networks, and it primarily focuses on how users can efficiently access licensed spectrum in a dynamic environment. This technology is a crucial means to tackle the problem of spectrum scarcity and low spectrum utilization. This work proposes a novel approach to address the issue of dynamic channel access optimization in wireless networks and investigates the dynamic resource optimization problem with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach focuses on the optimization of dynamic multi-channel access under multi-user scenarios and considers the collision and interference caused by multiple users accessing a channel simultaneously. Each user selects a channel to access and transmit data, and the network aims to develop a multi-user strategy that maximizes network benefits without requiring online coordination or information exchange between users. What makes this work unique is its utilization of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that keeps an internal state and combines observations over events. This approach allows the network to utilize the history of processes to estimate the true state, providing valuable insights into how deep reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to optimize dynamic channel access in wireless networks. The work's contribution lies in demonstrating that this approach is an effective means to solve the dynamic resource optimization problem, enabling the development of a multi-user strategy that maximizes network benefits. This approach is particularly valuable as it does not require online coordination or information exchange between users, which can be challenging in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach presents an important contribution to the field of dynamic spectrum access and wireless network optimization. As the demand for computer-based learning continues to increase, the use of intelligent methods to improve spectrum utilization in wireless networks will become even more critical. The findings of this work could have significant implications for the future of computer-based learning and education, enabling more efficient use of wireless networks and the creation of well-rounded citizens.

TI Optimized Control Method for Fused Deposition 3D Printing Slice Contour
   Path Based on Improved Hopfield Neural Network
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the contour path of fused deposition 3D printing slices to mitigate the limitations of inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. The proposed algorithm leverages the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) and an improved whale optimization algorithm to plan the printing order of each contour and optimize the network parameters, respectively. In particular, the algorithm transforms the running trajectory planning problem of the assembled tool head into a travel problem, which allows for a more efficient path planning approach. The HNN is then employed to determine the optimal path for each contour, with the network optimization process utilizing a nonlinear weight update method to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional HNN that is prone to generating invalid paths and falling into local optimality during operation. The network optimization process is designed to automatically adjust the link weights between neurons within a specific range, thereby ensuring that the network reaches the desired energy minima and outputs the optimal path for 3D printed slice contours. The proposed algorithm was tested in part printing experiments, and the results demonstrated a significant reduction in single-layer contour path lengths, printing times, and an enhancement in dimensional accuracy and surface quality of the printed parts compared to the traditional parallel scanning method. The proposed algorithm represents a significant contribution to the field of 3D printing, as it provides an efficient and effective approach for optimizing the contour path of fused deposition 3D printing slices. The findings of this study hold significant implications for improving the efficiency and quality of 3D printing and could potentially lead to further advancements in the field.

AB The development of society is greatly influenced by the physical strength of its individuals. As heirs of social construction, college students play a crucial role in national progress, and their physical health is an essential component of their well-being. However, the increasing competition for talent in today's rapidly advancing world has led to significant pressure on college students in various aspects of their lives. Despite the importance of physical exercise, students often lack the time and knowledge to engage in appropriate exercise programs that suit their individual needs. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm for the classification of college students' physical health data. The traditional K-means algorithm is known to be sensitive to noisy data, and thus, we introduce a variance-like weighting mechanism to improve its clustering accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can quickly and accurately cluster physical health data to provide a classification of each student's physical fitness. By using the physical classification of each student, we can recommend more suitable exercise programs to prioritize physical health management. This study highlights the significance of physical health in college students and encourages education departments to improve the efficiency of physical health management.

ID RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORK; OPTIMIZATION
AB The phenomenon of economic globalization has led to a greater intermingling of economy and culture, which has brought about new demands for innovative talent cultivation in universities. To meet these demands, universities need to cultivate more students with high language ability who are capable of communicating and exchanging ideas between different cultures. This requires universities to innovate their language cultivation programs and improve students' language ability and cultural literacy. The cultivation of international language ability, particularly in English language and literature, plays a vital role in enhancing students' comprehensive language literacy. However, traditional teaching methods have been found to be less effective in achieving desired learning outcomes. As such, there is a need to adopt more innovative teaching methods that stimulate students' interest in learning and facilitate their experience of English language and literature in authentic cultural contexts. One promising approach to achieve these objectives is through the integration of smart classroom teaching and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This approach offers a range of benefits, including personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and interactive engagement. Furthermore, the application of AI technology can assist teachers in guiding students to experience the cultural background of English language and literature in English situations, helping students to exercise their English language application skills. This paper proposes a method and application assessment for designing a smart classroom for English language and literature based on AI technology. The primary aim of this approach is to help students become familiar with the English context and cultural background, thereby improving their overall language proficiency. The proposed approach seeks to facilitate a more engaging and effective learning experience for students, allowing them to develop their language skills and cultural literacy in a meaningful and impactful way.

AB Neural machine translation (NMT) is applied to generate a more reliable and accurate translation practice as the most cutting-edge technology. In recent years, NMT has achieved gratifying results. However, the main obstacle for market-oriented NMT application systems appears to suffer from weak translation quality that fails to meet users' needs. This paper focuses on the machine translation of political documents and implements six dominant NMT application systems in the market to evaluate their translation quality. The evaluation process further employs both BLEU and NIST technical evaluation algorithms and re-verifies the results with the manual evaluation method called the "Score Ranking System" to compare the performances of the six NMTs in Chinese-English translations of political documents. Through diagnosis and evaluation of the problems and errors in NMTs, the paper eventually proposes the "Cue Lexicon+" model to remedy prominent problems.

AB Since all information depends solely on the training data, machine learning algorithms typically do not employ external knowledge or other experiences during the learning process. Methods for machine learning have been rigorously tested against novel varieties of highly technical "black box" or "white box" adversarial attacks. By employing attacks, attackers can change systems to serve a harmful end goal. When authorized implementers and eavesdroppers are geographically close together, it is difficult to perform secure beamforming in waveform applications, for instance, leading to erroneous beam forms and, as a result, disastrous beam leakages. As a result, the first move in a prospective black-box offense will be based on the waveform features of a learning signal. By including a non-orthogonality concept into the physical layer signal waveform, the Waveforms Eavesdropping Prevention Framework (WEPF) proposed in this work aims to boost machine learning security to address these difficulties. The implementation scenario is based on a waveforms scenario used to categorize the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) for insects, a crucial tool for researching the feeding conduct of piercing-sucking insects and the transition mechanism between viruses and insects. An attribute vector with six dimensions, consisting of low-frequency wavelet energy (LFWE) in the second and third layers of the Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine, fractal box dimension (FBD), the Hurst exponent (HE), and spectral centroid (SC) in the first two layers of the HHT, was used to test the proposed framework. Two adversarial scenarios were explored. However, the suggested architecture secures all waveform signals, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in lowering the risk of eavesdropping or tampering with the waveforms used in advanced machine-learning methods.

TI Speed Control Method for the Working Shaft of the Complex Hydraulic

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB The precise control of a complex hydraulic drive system, which is mostly dependent on the speed control of the system working shaft, contributes to an improvement in product quality. In this paper, a novel working shaft speed control method for complex hydraulic drive system is proposed. First, a mathematical model of the operation of the working shaft and related components is established, and the fuzzy PID controller is designed to regulate the working shaft speed of the complex hydraulic drive system based on fuzzy rules. A whale optimization algorithm improved by intuitionistic fuzzy entropy is proposed to optimize the parameters of fuzzy PID controller in light of the possibility that the selection of parameters of fuzzy PID controller will have an impact on the final control effect. By applying an improved fuzzy PID controller to fit working shaft speed of three complex hydraulic drive system, the control performance of the controller is evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that the tracking accuracy and immediate efficiency of the proposed method for working shaft speed control of the complex hydraulic drive systems are significantly better than those of the fuzzy PID controller and the fuzzy PID controller optimized with the unimproved whale optimization algorithm, proving the proposed method has strong engineering practical application capacity and can more effectively fulfill the working shaft speed control needs of the complex hydraulic drive system.

AB Under the mobile computing environment, a large number of convenient mobile terminals and extensive mobile network application services have been produced. The technology has been used in college sports teaching to optimize the management of sports teaching. In this context, this paper studies the application of the association rule algorithm and cluster analysis in basketball teaching, which will effectively promote the practice and application of the association rule algorithm and cluster analysis in college PE teaching in China. This paper studies basketball teaching in colleges and universities based on the applied explainable association rule algorithm and cluster analysis. It is concluded that the p value of positioning shooting in the basic basketball technology test between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment is 0.883, which is greater than 0.06, indicating that there is no significant difference between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment. The p value of round-trip straight dribble in the whole field is 0.735, which is greater than 0.07, indicating that there is no significant difference between the experimental class and the control class before the experiment. This teaching mode plays a significant role in cultivating beginners' learning interest and enthusiasm, preliminarily mastering movement skills and establishing solid technical concepts. With the complex emotional experience of the association rule algorithm, it is of great significance for teachers to grasp students' various emotional experiences in learning, cultivate students' team consciousness by cluster analysis, guide and dredge their negative emotions, and develop students' sense of cooperation, team spirit and democratic spirit, personal responsibility and personality.

AB To enhance the efficacy of intermittent hypoxia training in sports, this study presents an intelligent training model that utilizes a graph neural network. The model incorporates the particle filter method to establish a real-time processing system for physiological signals generated during intermittent hypoxia training, enabling frequency tracking and network sorting. Additionally, an ARMA model is utilized to facilitate real-time carrier frequency estimation and time-hopping detection of physiological signals. An enhanced frequency tracking method is proposed based on the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and ARMA model to improve the accuracy of frequency tracking while minimizing algorithm complexity. The experimental results indicate that the fusion of the GNN and the proposed intermittent hypoxia training model can effectively enhance the effects of intermittent hypoxia training in sports.

TI An Automatic Classification Method for Multiple Music Genres by

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we present an approach to improve the effectiveness of automatic classification of music genres by integrating emotion and intelligent algorithms. We propose an automatic recognition and classification algorithm for music spectra, which takes into account emotional cues that can be extracted from music to improve classification accuracy. To achieve this goal, we set different weight coefficients, which are continuously adjusted based on the convergence process of the previous iteration. The size of each weighting coefficient is adaptively controlled to reduce the number of iterations of the reconstruction process, thereby reducing the algorithm's computational complexity and speeding up its convergence. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the automatic classification method of music genres, which integrates emotion and intelligent algorithms, can significantly improve the accuracy of automatic music genre classification. Moreover, our approach reduces the algorithm's computational complexity, resulting in a faster convergence speed. Our proposed approach provides a promising solution for automatic music genre classification that takes into account emotional cues. The integration of emotion and intelligent algorithms can help achieve higher accuracy and reduce computational complexity, making the proposed method applicable in various scenarios.

AB This paper aims to introduce a new approach to enhance college English learning through an intelligent method that constructs a learning environment from a demand analysis perspective. The proposed model utilizes a bionic algorithm to structure the algorithm and adopts a highly efficient energy generation method to calculate the interaction energy. This study aims to find the optimal solution to the constraint problem by using a process of continuous generation, expansion, and replacement of magnetosomes. The methodology employed in this research involved constructing the college English learning environment in colleges and universities from a demand analysis perspective. This was achieved by analyzing the needs and requirements of college students and designing an ecological virtual learning environment (EVLE) that meets their demands. The findings of this study indicate that the proposed EVLE for college English is effective in improving the effectiveness of college English learning. The experimental verification results support the effectiveness of the proposed model in creating an interactive and engaging learning environment that facilitates the acquisition of English language skills. It is an innovative approach to college English learning that utilizes intelligent methods to construct a demand-driven learning environment that enhances students' learning outcomes.

AB This paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of moral education teaching through an innovative approach. By integrating neural network technology, a data-model-driven three-dimensional initial model construction algorithm was proposed to identify the characteristics of moral education classroom teaching. The 3D space base point and initial value of shape parameters were obtained based on color point cloud data, and the 3D space coordinates of all the vertices of the model were calculated using the Euclidean distance algorithm, resulting in the construction of an initial 3D model. Furthermore, a model of Innovative Moral Education (IME) in higher education was developed based on neural network, and a framework analysis was conducted. Results from simulation teaching research indicate that the IME teaching mode based on the proposed neural network model has a significant practical effect. Overall, this study offers insights into an innovative approach to moral education teaching and contributes to the development of effective pedagogical practices.

TI Physical Domain Reconstruction with Finite Volume Neural Networks
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The finite volume neural network (FINN) is an exception among recent physics-aware neural network models as it allows the specification of arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). FINN can generalize and adapt to various prescribed BC values not provided during training, where other models fail. However, FINN depends explicitly on given BC values and cannot deal with unobserved parts within the physical domain. To overcome these limitations, we extend FINN in two ways. First, we integrate the capability to infer BC values on-the-fly from just a few data points. This allows us to apply FINN in situations, where the BC values, such as the inflow rate of fluid into a simulated medium, are unknown. Second, we extend FINN to plausibly reconstruct missing data within the physical domain via a gradient-driven spin-up phase. Our experiments validate that FINN reliably infers correct BCs, but also generates smooth and plausible full-domain reconstructions that are consistent with the observable data. Moreover, FINN can generate precise predictions orders of magnitude more accurate compared to competitive pure ML and physics-aware ML models - even when the physical domain is only partially visible, and the BCs are applied at a point that is spatially distant from the observable volumes.

AB To prevent products with missing character information from reaching the market, manufacturers need an automatic character recognition method. One of the key problems of this recognition method is to recognise text under complex package patterns. In addition, some products use dot matrix characters to reduce printing costs, which makes text extraction more difficult. We propose a character detection algorithm using DBNet as the base network, combined with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve its feature extraction of characters in complex contexts. After the character area has been located by the detection algorithm, it is intercepted and fed into a fully convolutional character recognition network to achieve print character recognition. We use ResNet as the backbone network and CTC loss for training. In addition, the CBAM module was added to the backbone network to enhance its recognition of dot matrix characters. The algorithm was finally deployed on the jetson nano. The experimental results show that the character detection accuracy reaches 97.9%, an improvement of 1.9% compared to the original network. As for the character recognition algorithm, the inference speed is doubled when deployed to the nano platform compared to the CRNN network, with an accuracy of 97.8%.

AB In order to improve the effect of visual communication art design, this paper combines virtual reality technology to analyze the quantitative impact of visual communication art design. The paper aims to address the need for more effective visual communication art design by proposing a new design system incorporating virtual reality technology. Moreover, this paper elaborates two implementations of semi-covered virtual reality graphics through pictures and texts: by translating the turntable or offsetting the detector. In addition to this, this paper expounds the semi-covered virtual reality graphics realized by the translation stage. By interpolating the projection data onto a virtual detector, the half-covering virtual reality graphics realized by the translation stage can theoretically be equivalent to the half-covering virtual reality graphics realized by offsetting the virtual detector. It uses semi-covered virtual reality graphics achieved through the translation stage as the main methodological approach to achieve this goal. It conducts experimental research to evaluate the system's effectiveness. The experimental research shows that the visual communication design system based on virtual reality technology proposed in this paper has good design performance and can effectively improve the effect of visual communication art design.

DT Article
AB Translation as a bridge between different cultures has received significant attention in recent years, especially with the rise of globalization and the increasing communication between nations. Translation has become a crucial tool for connecting people, promoting cross-cultural understanding, and facilitating international trade, academic exchange, and outbound tourism. With the advancement of information technology, research on improving English translation algorithms has become a hot topic. This is due to the complexities and variability of language, where words can have different meanings in different contexts. To address the issue of semantic coherence in current English translation proofreading systems, this paper proposes a semantic ontology translation model that utilizes fuzzy mapping to translate English and selects the most semantically appropriate translation using a decision function. The contributions of this research are twofold. Firstly, it provides a new approach to English translation proofreading by incorporating semantic ontology and fuzzy mapping. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through the improved efficiency and accuracy of English proofreading. The key findings of this study show that the proposed semantic ontology translation model can significantly improve the semantic coherence of English translation proofreading. This makes this article different from other studies by offering a unique solution to the problem of semantic coherence in English translation proofreading.

ID SCHEME
AB The deep integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial intelligence makes the further development of intelligent medical services possible, but privacy leakage and data security problems hinder its wide application. Although the combination of IoMT and federated learning (FL) can achieve no direct access to the original data of participants, FL still can't resist inference attacks against model parameters and the single point of failure of the central server. In addition, malicious clients can disguise as benign participants to launch poisoning attacks, which seriously compromises the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, we design a new privacy protection framework (BFG) for decentralized FL using blockchain, differential privacy and Generative Adversarial Network. The framework can effectively avoid a single point of failure and resist inference attacks. In particular, it can limit the success rate of poisoning attacks to less than 26%. Moreover, the framework alleviates the storage pressure of the blockchain, achieves a balance between privacy budget and global model accuracy, and can effectively resist the negative impact of node withdrawal. Simulation experiments on image datasets show that the BFG framework has a better combined performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and privacy preservation.

AB To improve the teaching effect of the Chinese language and literature majors, this paper combines artificial intelligence technology and performance to build a teaching system for the Chinese language and literature majors. Based on the existing coordination algorithms, this paper proposes a classifier-based fast calculation method for successive breaking of active power flow, which provides high-quality active power information for the static safety check and control of successive breaking at a small computational cost. Moreover, this paper improves the operation effect of the teaching system, increases the calculation speed, and adopts the NR method for algorithm-sensitive faults to ensure the reliability of the power flow results. The proposed teaching system was tested in a simulated teaching environment to evaluate its effectiveness. The testing results showed that the system significantly improved student performance, engagement, and satisfaction. However, some challenges and limitations were also encountered during the testing process, such as the need for sufficient computing power and the difficulty in accommodating individual learning styles. The findings of this paper suggest that the proposed teaching system has the potential to enhance the learning outcomes of Chinese language and literature students. However, further testing and optimization are needed to address the challenges and limitations encountered in the testing process.

AB The proliferation of location-based service applications has led to a substantial surge in the amount of life trajectory data produced by mobile devices. And these data frequently contain confidential personal details. Simultaneously, the corresponding relatively lagging privacy protection technology and the improper trajectory data handling method will make tremendous problems with privacy breach. Therefore, this paper presents a trajectory privacy data publishing scheme, denoted as LORDP, which is based on local optimisation and R-tree. The proposed scheme aims to handle sensitive data while improves trajectory protection effectiveness. Firstly, the scheme combines the LKC-privacy model requirement to filter out the minimum violating sequences set, to reduce data sensitivity and the amount of injected noise. Secondly, R-tree is constructed based on trajectory similarity. Finally, Laplacian noise is added to the R-tree's leaf nodes constrained by differential privacy. The experiments show that the proposed LORDP algorithm significantly enhances the utility of data compared to other algorithms, and reduces the loss rate of about approximately 2% for per trajectory data, which shows that the present algorithm is extremely effective.

AB It is true that with society entering a new era, the pressure of competition for employment of college students is increasing, and society has higher requirements for the quality of high-tech talents, which can result in mental health issues for college students. Therefore, focusing on psychological education for college students and improving their psychological quality is essential. The analysis and countermeasure research on psychological characteristics has become crucial in this context. To address this issue, this work proposes an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) Deep Belief Network (DBN) method to analyze the psychological characteristics of college students. The proposed method first uses DBN to analyze the psychological characteristics of college students. Secondly, the learning factors and inertia weights in PSO are dynamically adjusted to construct IPSO to address the problem of slow overall convergence speed caused by the initial randomization of weights in the DBN training process. IPSO is then combined with DBN to adjust the initial weights for DBN training. This work also proposes a series of countermeasures from different aspects to strengthen mental health education for college students. The validity of IPSO-DBN for college students' psychological characteristics analysis is verified through comprehensive and systematic experiments, and the feasibility of college students' mental health education countermeasures is confirmed via comparison. Overall, this work provides an innovative and effective approach for analyzing college students' psychological characteristics and developing countermeasures to improve their mental health. It shows the potential of combining artificial intelligence with psychological education and highlights the importance of strengthening psychological health education for college students.

AB The emerging senior tourism industry has attracted increasing attention in China due to the continuous development of social, economic and technological factors. However, the senior tourism market in China still faces significant shortages, and further market development is needed. To address this issue, a senior tourism business model based on the circular economy, artificial intelligence (AI) technology and multi-source heterogeneous data integration has been proposed in this study. The model uses AI technology to integrate and analyze multi-source heterogeneous data, providing insights into the senior tourism market and facilitating precise marketing. Additionally, the model combines senior tourism products with sustainable development by adopting a circular economy model, achieving both economic and environmental benefits. The application of this model is expected to enhance the competitiveness and sustainable development of the Chinese senior tourism market, providing new ideas and references for the development of the industry. The integration of multi-source heterogeneous data is a significant feature of this model, which facilitates a more in-depth understanding of the senior tourism market.

ID MODEL
AB Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an active research area in affective computing. Recognizing emotions from speech signals helps to assess human behaviour, which has promising applications in the area of human-computer interaction. The performance of deep learning-based SER methods relies heavily on feature learning. In this paper, we propose SCAR-NET, an improved convolutional neural network, to extract emotional features from speech signals and implement classification. This work includes two main parts: First, we extract spectral, temporal, and spectral-temporal correlation features through three parallel paths; and then split-convolve-aggregate residual blocks are designed for multi-branch deep feature learning. The features are refined by global average pooling (GAP) and pass through a softmax classifier to generate predictions for different emotions. We also conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of SCAR-NET which can achieve 96.45%, 83.13%, and 89.93% accuracy on the speech emotion datasets EMO-DB, SAVEE, and RAVDESS. These results show the outperformance of SCAR-NET.

AB In contemporary society people constantly are facing situations that influence appearance of serious diseases. For the development of intelligent decision support systems and services in medical and health domains, it is necessary to collect huge amount of patients' complex data. Patient's multimodal data must be properly prepared for intelligent processing and obtained results should be presented in a friendly way to the physicians/caregivers to recommend tailored actions that will improve patients' quality of life. Advanced artificial intelligence approaches like machine/deep learning, federated learning, explainable artificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of medical and health data in future. In this paper, we will focus on presentation of a part of a novel Open AI Architecture for cancer patients that is devoted to intelligent medical data management. Essential activities are data collection, proper design and preparation of data to be used for training machine learning predictive models. Another key aspect is oriented towards intelligent interpretation and visualisation of results about patient's quality of life obtained from machine learning models. The Architecture has been developed as a part of complex project in which 15 institutions from 8 European countries have been participated.

TI Multi-Behavior Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks
   Recommendation Algorithm based on Feature-Interaction
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
AB Graph convolution neural networks have shown powerful ability in recommendation, thanks to extracting the user-item collaboration signal from users' historical interaction information. However, many existing studies often learn the final embedded representation of items and users through IDs of user and item, which cannot make well explanation why user choose the item. By making good use of item's attribute, the networks will gain better interpretability. In this article, we construct a heterogeneous tripartite graph consisting of user-item-feature, and propose the attention interaction graph convolutional neural network recommendation algorithm (ATGCN). We embed multi-feature fusion of users and items into the user feature interaction layer by using multi-head-attention, which explore the user's potential preference to update the user's embedded representation. Through the neighborhood aggregation of graph convolution, the feature neighbors' aggregation of items is constructed to achieve higher-order feature fusions, and the neighborhood aggregation of users and items is carried out on the historical interaction information. Then, the final embedding vector representations of user and item are obtained after many iterations. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on three publicly available datasets and ATGCN has improved 1.59%, 2.03%, and 1.27% in normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), Precision and Recall, respectively.

AB Aiming at the problem of low detection accuracy of network traffic data types by traditional intrusion detection methods, we propose an improved Harris Hawk hybrid intrusion detection method to enhance the detection capability. The improved Harris Hawk optimization algorithm is used as a feature selection scheme to reduce the impact of redundant and noisy features on the performance of the classification model. The algorithm introduces the singer map to initialise the population, uses multi-information fusion to obtain the best prey position, and applies the sine function-based escape energy to execute a prey search strategy to obtain the optimal subset of features. In addition, the original data is preprocessed by the k-nearest neighbour and deep denoising autoencoder (KNN-DDAE) to relieve the imbalance problem of the network traffic data. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to complete the classification. Simulation experiments are conducted on the dataset NSL-KDD, KDD CUP99, and UNSW-NB15. The results show that our feature selection and data balancing scheme greatly improves the detection accuracy. In addition, the detection performance of this method is better than the current popular intrusion detection schemes.

AB Providing personalized recommendation service for users and improving the accuracy of recommendation and user satisfaction are the main research tasks of current travel recommendation systems. The intelligent recommendation model of tourist places requires the algorithm to be able to accurately recommend tourist attractions according to the user's interests. Big data and artificial intelligence technologies have driven the development of intelligent recommendation systems. However, realistic data are often sparse, and the lack of common rating items among users makes some traditional similarity measures impossible to calculate. In addition, traditional collaborative filtering algorithms ignore the issue of user preferences, which can cause a decrease in recommendation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper analyzes the factors affecting users' interest preferences in terms of their global and local rating information. The interest preferences of users are calculated by computing the probability distribution of user rating information globally and using Hamming approach degree. A similarity algorithm about user preferences is derived using Jeffries-Matusita distance. The similarity algorithm is effectively combined with the traditional similarity algorithm to propose a model of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm for tourist attractions based on user preferences under sparse data. The paper aims to improve the accuracy of tourist attraction recommendation systems by incorporating user preferences and addressing the issue of sparse data and the lack of common rating items among users that traditional similarity measures cannot calculate. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm model outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and other algorithms. And it also has high accuracy rate on more sparse tourism data set.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The purpose of traffic classification is to allocate bandwidth to different types of data on a network. Application-level traffic classification is important for identifying the applications that are in high demand on the network. Due to the increasing complexity and volume of internet traffic, machine learning and deep learning methods are being used more frequently in traffic classification. The focus of this research is to evaluate the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in classifying network packets by application type, as well as classifying the type of data communicated within an application. The research considers encrypted network packets, including those from Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and the WhatsApp mobile application. Previous research has shown that deep learning methods are effective in the feature learning process, so this study uses a simple feed-forward Deep Neural Network (DNN) to improve the performance of the SVM algorithm. Additionally, various feature learning frameworks based on deep learning, such as DNN, Autoencoder and PCA, are compared. The study concludes that the DNN is able to improve the F1 score of the SVM classifier from 0.78 to 0.90. Furthermore, the study shows that using a hybrid framework of DNN with SVM can address the class imbalance problem often present in machine learning.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has generated massive data in the healthcare sector in recent years, encouraging researchers and scientists to uncover the underlying facts. Mining interesting patterns in the large COVID-19 corpora is very important and useful for the decision makers. This paper presents a novel approach for uncovering interesting insights in large datasets using ontologies and BERT models. The research proposes a framework for extracting semantically rich facts from data by incorporating domain knowledge into the data mining process through the use of ontologies. An improved Apriori algorithm is employed for mining semantic association rules, while the interestingness of the rules is evaluated using BERT models for semantic richness. The results of the proposed framework are compared with state-of-the-art methods and evaluated using a combination of domain expert evaluation and statistical significance testing. The study offers a promising solution for finding meaningful relationships and facts in large datasets, particularly in the healthcare sector.

TI Interpretable SAM-kNN Regressor for Incremental Learning on

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
ID CONCEPT DRIFT; MODEL
AB In many real-world scenarios, data are provided as a potentially infinite stream of samples that are subject to changes in the underlying data distribution, a phenomenon often referred to as concept drift. A specific facet of concept drift is feature drift, where the relevance of a feature to the problem at hand changes over time. High-dimensionality of the data poses an additional challenge to learning algorithms operating in such environments. Common scenarios of this nature can for example be found in sensor-based maintenance operations of industrial machines or inside entire networks, such as power grids or water distribution systems. However, since most existing methods for incremental learning focus on classification tasks, efficient online learning for regression is still an underdeveloped area. In this work, we introduce an extension to the SAM-kNN Regressor that incorporates metric learning in order to improve the prediction quality on data streams, gain insights into the relevance of different input features and based on that, transform the input data into a lower dimension in order to improve computational complexity and suitability for high-dimensional data. We evaluate our proposed method on artificial data, to demonstrate its applicability in various scenarios. In addition to that, we apply the method to the real-world problem of water distribution network monitoring. Specifically, we demonstrate that sensor faults in the water distribution network can be detected by monitoring the feature relevances computed by our algorithm.

AB Online transaction fraud has become increasingly rampant due to the convenience of mobile payment. Fraud detection is critical to ensure the security of online transactions. With the development of graph neural network, researchers have applied it to the field of fraud detection. The existing fraud detection methods will solve the class imbalance by sampling, but they do not fully consider the various imbalances in the heterogeneous graph, and the data imbalance will directly affect the performance of the model. This work proposes a hybrid graph neural network model for online fraud detection to address this issue. The three types of imbalance in online transactions are feature imbalance, category imbalance, and relation imbalance, and they are all addressed in the proposed model. The entities with the feature most closely related to the fraudsters will be determined for the feature imbalance, and samples will be taken for further identification in the subsequent training phase. The hybrid model then uses under-sampling in combination with the long-distance sampling to find nodes with high similarity of features for the category imbalance. Finally, we propose a reward/punishment mechanism based on reinforcement learning for relation imbalance, which uses the threshold created by training as the sampling weight between relations. This paper conducts experiments on the public datasets Amazon and Yelp. The experimental results show that the model proposed is 5.61% higher than the best model in the comparison model on Amazon dataset, and 1.58% higher on Yelp dataset.

DE Object detection; active learning; semi-supervised learning
AB Object detection is a challenging task that requires a large amount of labeled data to train high-performance models. However, labeling huge amounts of data is expensive, making it difficult to train a good detector with limited labeled data. Existing approaches mitigate this issue via active learning or semi-supervised learning, but there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for deep object detection that fully exploits unlabeled data by combining the benefits of active learning and semi-supervised learning. Our method first trains an initial model using limited labeled data, then uses self-training and data augmentation strategies to train a semi-supervised model using labeled and unlabeled data. We then select query samples based on informativeness and representativeness from the unlabeled data to further improve the model through semi-supervised training. Experimental results on commonly used object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

AB Federated learning (FL) can push the limitation of "Data Island" while protecting data privacy has been a broad concern. However, the centralised FL is vulnerable to a single-point failure. While decentralised and tamper-proof blockchains can cope with the above issues, it is difficult to find a benign benchmark gradient and eliminate the poisoning attack in the later stage of global model aggregation. To address the above problems, we present a global to local based privacy-preserving federated consensus scheme against poisoning attacks (FedG2L). This scheme can effectively reduce the influence of poisoning attacks on model accuracy. In the global aggregation stage, a gradient-similarity-based secure consensus algorithm (SecPBFT) is designed to eliminate malicious gradients. During this procedure, the gradient of the data owner will not be leaked. Then, we propose an improved ACGAN algorithm to generate local data to further update the model without poisoning attacks. Finally, we theoretically prove the security and correctness of our scheme. Experimental results demonstrated that the model accuracy is improved by at least 55% than no defense scheme, and the attack success rate is reduced by more than 60%.

AB Safety-critical systems play a significant role in industrial domains, and their complexity is increasing with advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). To provide efficient services, safety-critical systems that integrate AI applications are always built based on Linux, where Linux offers massive amounts of features and an incredibly perfect software ecosystem for AI applications. Since Linux is a pre-existing complex software system, different research programmes aim to pave the way for developing Linux-based safety-critical systems. Still, only some focus on the system calls for file operations. However, the execution path of a system call is effectively non-deterministic in Linux kernel space, which challenges the test coverage-based verification recommended by the functional safety standards. This research analyzes the influence of system state on Linux kernel path variability from two perspectives: file system type and system load. Therefore, an online data collection system for system call execution paths was constructed based on Ftrace, network file system (NFS), and MD5 hash function, uniquely identifying the system call execution path. The collected data were processed and analysed in this study. Evaluations show that the number of function execution paths of the system calls relevant to file systems increased with the increase in system load but would eventually be stable. Additionally, the function execution paths of the system call varied in different file systems. Based on the evaluations, the results of this work can provide advice for analyzing Linux-based safety-critical systems. In addition, the method introduced in this research can also provide support for the verification of Linux-based safety-critical systems.

AB Human resource management was of great significance for enterprises to formulate development strategies and improve competitiveness. With the rapid development of new technologies such as knowledge economy and big data, the traditional human resource performance appraisal model had certain limitations and was not objective, which had been difficult to adapt to the increasingly highly integrated development needs of modern enterprises. Therefore, this paper used big data analysis and new technical means to put forward the study of human resource performance evaluation model based on Bayesian network, aiming to provide some theoretical reference for modern enterprise human resource management. First of all, it summarized the related concepts of performance appraisal and its important position in enterprise management, analyzed the characteristics of human resources performance appraisal indicators and their mutual relations, and expounded the common methods and characteristics needed to build a performance appraisal system. Secondly, it summarized the relevant theory of Bayesian network and its advantages in solving complex random problems, and proposed a performance appraisal model based on Bayesian network for the needs of enterprise human resources management. Finally, the balanced scorecard method was used to build a performance appraisal system, and the performance appraisal model proposed in this paper was tested by experiments, and compared with the traditional method. The results showed that the performance appraisal model proposed in this paper had significant advantages and could be better applied to the performance appraisal management of enterprise human resources. The research of this paper can not only provide theoretical guidance for further research on enterprise human resource allocation and management, but also provide reference for performance appraisal in other fields.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect words in a given sentence or document. Existing studies have recognised the value of interactive learning in ABSA and have developed various methods to precisely model aspect words and their contexts through interactive learning. However, these methods mostly take a shallow interactive way to model aspect words and their contexts, which may lead to the lack of complex sentiment information. To solve this issue, we propose a Lightweight Multilayer Interactive Attention Network (LMIAN) for ABSA. Specifically, we first employ a pre-trained language model to initialise word embedding vectors. Second, an interactive computational layer is designed to build correlations between aspect words and their contexts. Such correlation degree is calculated by multiple computational layers with neural attention models. Third, we use a parameter-sharing strategy among the computational layers. This allows the model to learn complex sentiment features with lower memory costs. Finally, LMIAN conducts instance validation on six publicly available sentiment analysis datasets. Extensive experiments show that LMIAN performs better than other advanced methods with relatively low memory consumption.

AB This study aims to investigate the influence of punctum image in destinations on tourists' behavioral intentions. The study proposes the concepts of punctum and studium image based on semiology and uses an interpretable moderated mediation model to examine the effects of punctum image, studium image, flow experience, and human interaction on behavioral intention. The proposed research collected data from 440 tourists who visited a destination and used a structural equation model to analyze the relationships among the variables. The study employed bootstrapping to test the significance of the mediating effects and conducted a moderated mediation analysis to examine the moderating role of human interaction. The findings of the study indicate that punctum image has a positive effect on studium image and behavioral intention. Studium image is found to mediate the relationship between punctum image and behavioral intention. Additionally, the study shows that there are multiple mediations of studium image and flow experience between punctum image and behavioral intention. Finally, the study finds that human interaction plays a moderating role in two of the mediating effects. The results of this research have important theoretical and managerial implications. The study highlights the importance of punctum image in destination branding and suggests that destinations should focus on creating memorable and distinctive images to attract tourists. The study also emphasizes the role of studium image and flow experience in shaping tourists' behavioral intentions, which could help destinations to design more effective marketing strategies. Finally, the study underscores the importance of human interaction in shaping tourists' experiences and suggests that destinations should focus on providing high-quality human interactions to enhance tourists' experiences and satisfaction. The use of an interpretable moderated mediation model in this study enhances the interpretability and practical applicability of the results for decision-makers.

TI Towards Autonomous Driving Model Resistant to Adversarial Attack
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) offer improved efficiency and convenience through innovative embedded devices. However, the development of these technologies has often neglected security measures, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Conceding that a CAV system is compromised, it can result in unsafe driving conditions and pose a threat to human safety. Prioritizing both security measures and functional enhancements on development of CAVs is essential to ensure their safety and reliability and enhance consumer trust in the technology. CAVs use artificial intelligence to control their driving behavior, which can be easily influenced by small changes in the model that can significantly impact and potentially mislead the system. To address this issue, this study proposed a defense mechanism that uses an autoencoder and a compressive memory module to store normal image features and prevent unexpected generalization on adversarial inputs. The proposed solution was studied against Hijacking, Vanishing, Fabrication, and Mislabeling attacks using FGSM and AdvGAN against the Nvidia Dave-2 driving model, and was found to be effective, with success rates of 93.8 % and 91.2 % in a Whitebox setup, and 74.1 % and 64.4 % in a Blackbox setup for FGSM and AdvGAN, respectively. That improves the results by 24.7 % in Whitebox setup 21.5 % in Blackbox setup.

AB Harmony can be defined in a musical way as art that combines several musical notes reproduced simultaneously to create sounds that are coherent to human ears and serve as accompaniment and filling. However, working out harmony is not a simple task. It requires knowledge, experience, and an intense study of music theory, which takes time to reach good skills. Thus, systems capable of automatically harmonizing melodies are beneficial for experienced and novice musicians. In this paper, a comparative study between distinct architectures and ensembles of Artificial Neural Networks was proposed to solve the problem of musical harmonization, seeking consistent results with rules of music theory: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function network (RBF), Echo State Network (ESN), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). For this, a processed and defined melody with symbolic musical data serves as input to the system, having been trained from a musical database that contains melody and harmony. The output is the chord sequence to be applied to the melody. The results were analyzed with quantitative measures and the ability to melody adaptation. The performances were favorable to the MLP, which could generate harmonies according to the objectives.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Taekwondo is a martial art emphasizing defense, protection, and moral and spiritual values. Evaluating the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training is a complex task that requires the consideration of various factors, such as the learners' skills, physical condition, and psychological state. Traditional methods for evaluating sports training effectiveness and quality have limitations, such as being subjective, time-consuming, and not considering individual differences. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluating the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training using optimization algorithms. Specifically, three optimization algorithms, TLBO, DSLTLBO, and GWO, are compared and analyzed for their suitability at different levels. These algorithms can automatically adjust the sports training plan based on individual differences and learner feedback, which can address the limitations of traditional evaluation methods. Validity statistics and moral/spiritual level assessment are used to evaluate the training results and process quality. The results indicate that different optimization algorithms are appropriate for learners at different levels. Diversified algorithm forms are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of the sports plan. This paper provides insights into optimizing Taekwondo sports training and highlights the importance of cultivating moral and spiritual values through this martial art. The proposed approach can potentially improve the effectiveness and quality of Taekwondo sports training and can be extended to other sports or physical activities.

TI SAR Image Target Recognition Method by Global and Local Dictionary
   Sparse Representation
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Target variant detection has been challenging for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and the performance of the target variant recognition needs to be further enhanced. SAR images are widely used in the field of target recognition and are important to support reconnaissance operations. This paper proposes a novel research approach to improve the efficiency of target recognition. First, the theory surrounding sparse representation and dictionary learning is presented. Secondly, a SAR image target recognition model is constructed according to the theory. Meanwhile, a dynamic joint sparse representation model is proposed based on multi-information and applied to SAR image target recognition when sparse representation is under consideration. Finally, experiments are set up to validate the proposed model. The results are presented as follows: 1. the recognition rate range of the sample SAR image target is 0.811-0.995 and 0.867-0.990, respectively, when the two cases, without registration processing and with registration processing, utilize the recognition method of dictionary learning and sparse representation. 2. with the increase in dictionary size, the average recognition rate of SAR images based on multi-information dynamic joint sparse representation also increases under the conditions of no logarithm transformation and median filtering and after logarithm transformation and median filtering are run. Then, the average recognition rate range is 0.63-0.9 and 0.65-0.96, respectively. Thus, the recognition rate is improved by 5%-10%. 3. the recognition approach based on the sparse representation of multi-information dynamic joint has distinct sparse degrees of SAR image recognition in the case of logarithmic transformation and median filtering when the sample image has been registered and not been registered. The relative average recognition rates were 0.950-0.970 and 0.955-0.977, respectively. The key contribution of the research is to offer a workable solution to the issues plaguing SAR target variant recognition and to improve the significant limitations in the state-of-the-art literature thoroughly.

TI Image polar radius distribution for seed orientation adjustment
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM
AB Seed orientation is an important factor in high-speed automatic seeders used for sowing crops such as garlic cloves and corn kernels. However, obtaining accurate seed orientation angles can be challenging due to high-frequency noise points and false top features in seed images, which can negatively impact the orientation effect. In this paper, we introduce a directional adjustment method based on the polar radius distribution map to address this issue. Our method involves two main steps. Firstly, we use the morphological opening operation to process speckles and some seed apex parts and use the region marker to obtain the original polar radius distribution curve signal. Secondly, we use the wavelet packet transform to analyze the original polar radius distribution curve signal, which yields a direction rotation angle after analysis and calculation and enables the determination of seed orientation. Our experimental results show that our method can better identify the germination location at the top of the seed, and the calculated rotation angle is more conducive to seed direction adjustment than the rotation angle directly determined by the maximum polar radius in the polar radius vector. This is due to the advantage of higher frequency resolution of wavelet packet analysis, which enables us to obtain a polar radius distribution curve signal with low noise, better smoothness, and more realistic reflection of the edge characteristics of the seed contour boundary. The proposed method provides an effective solution for accurately adjusting the orientation of garlic cloves and corn kernels and potentially other crops that require automation technology. Our key finding is that using the polar radius distribution map and wavelet packet transform can yield better results in seed orientation adjustment, by removing high-frequency noise points and false top features and improving the accuracy of seed rotation angle calculation.

AB A key point in designing learning environments to implement children's literature programs is the intelligent adaptation to the highest quality content to serve users' peculiarities better. The concept of adaptation refers to the implementation of settings in a digital learning environment based on the diversity of students' characteristics and needs, adopting a highly reasoning educational design, based on which the system adapts the form and content of children's literature lessons. To implement the adaptation in a modern learning environment, this work proposes the design of a High Reasoning Intelligent Library System that provides personalized support for children's literature at an individual or group level, taking into account their unique characteristics, their evolution during their studies, but also to provide them with the possibility of involvement in the educational process. The proposed approach is a mathematical model expressed in mathematical equations and explanations. Mathematical models make it easier and cheaper to consider more system states than would likely be possible with actual experimental models. The proposed method uses intuitive disambiguation and fuzzy indexes to integrate the educational material based on its optimal adaptation in each case.

TI Toward Prompt-Enhanced Sentiment Analysis with Mutual Describable
   Information Between Aspects
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sentiment analysis aims to attain the sentiment polarity of the text, which is a coarse-grained approach and does not focus on the targets . On the other hand, an aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has recently gained boosting interest. The ABSA is a fine-grained sentiment assignment to determine the sentiment tendency toward a specific aspect. Most previous methods employ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) coupled with attention mechanisms to accomplish this task. However, such RNN-based models tend to be complex and require much training. Recently, a growing number of BERT-style models have been emerging and presenting better results in ABSA tasks . Nevertheless, these methods cannot well distinguish the various logical relationships between aspects that exist in the data and thus do not model the relationship between aspects. In the manuscript, a prompt-enhanced sentiment analysis (PESA) is proposed. Hence, a novel and efficient approach could retrieve the training set that is most similar to the input text and represents the mutual information between aspects by utilizing the [MASK] token. Moreover, the proposed model only needs to forward once if a sentiment analysis of multiple aspects is required in the inference stage. The language representation model BERT is employed to boost the performance of the proposed method. Comprehensive experiments and conducted analysis indicate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

ID DELIVERY
AB Machine learning and data mining are being used in different fields like data analysis, prediction, image processing, etc., and particularly in healthcare. Over the past decade, several types of research have been carried out focusing on machine learning and data mining application to generate intuitions from historical data and make predictions about the results. Machine learning algorithms play a vital role in improving healthcare systems due to continuous research in machine learning applications. Several researchers have used algorithms of machine learning to develop systems for decision support, analyze clinical aspects, use historical data to extract useful information, make future predictions and categorize diseases, etc. to help physicians make better decisions. In this study, we used an ensemble modeling voting technique for the classification of the birth dataset. Ensemble models combine individual machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy by predicting from the combined output of the base classifiers. Gradient boosting classifier (GBC), random forest (RF), bagging classifier (BC), and extra trees classifier (ETC) were used as base learners for making a voting ensemble model for the classification of the birth dataset. The results produced have shown that the voting classifier of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extra trees classifier, and bagging classifier has given the best results with the proportion of 94.78%, gradient boosting classifier has 84.39% accuracy, the random forest has 94.26% accuracy, extra trees classifier have 94.02% accuracy and bagging classifier has 93.65% accuracy. The accuracy achieved by ensemble modeling is far higher than the machine learning algorithms. Ensemble models increase the accuracy of machine learning algorithms by reducing variance and classification errors. The development of such a system will not only help health organizations to take effective measures to improve the maternal health assessment process but will also open the doors for interdisciplinary research in two different fields in the region.

TI Learning Bidirectional Action-Language Translation with Limited
   Supervision and Testing with Incongruent Input
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
ID MOTOR; NICO
AB Human infant learning happens during exploration of the environment, by interaction with objects, and by listening to and repeating utterances casually, which is analogous to unsupervised learning. Only occasionally, a learning infant would receive a matching verbal description of an action it is committing, which is similar to supervised learning. Such a learning mechanism can be mimicked with deep learning. We model this weakly supervised learning paradigm using our Paired Gated Autoencoders (PGAE) model, which combines an action and a language autoencoder. After observing a performance drop when reducing the proportion of supervised training, we introduce the Paired Transformed Autoencoders (PTAE) model, using Transformer-based crossmodal attention. PTAE achieves significantly higher accuracy in language-to-action and action-to-language translations, particularly in realistic but difficult cases when only few supervised training samples are available. We also test whether the trained model behaves realistically with conflicting multimodal input. In accordance with the concept of incongruence in psychology, conflict deteriorates the model output. Conflicting action input has a more severe impact than conflicting language input, and more conflicting features lead to larger interference. PTAE can be trained on mostly unlabeled data where labeled data is scarce, and it behaves plausibly when tested with incongruent input.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The core of teaching consists of four basic values: dignity, truthfulness, fairness, responsibility & freedom. All teaching is founded on ethics - whether it be the teacher-student relationship, pluralism, or a teacher's relationship with their work. This article combines intelligent emotion detection technology and a data mining algorithm to develop a model for evaluating college professors' morals to discover an effective way to do so. This study examines the moral hazard game model of concealed behaviors of instructors with overconfidence in four risk preference combinations based on fair fundamental assumptions and comparisons with rational teachers with the same risk preference. In addition, this research formulates the ideal incentive contract for each circumstance. It creates a model of the assessment system of college professors' morality in conjunction with their real teaching environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to assess the influence of the assessment system on the morality of college instructors. The experimental investigation indicates that the assessment technique of college professors' morality presented in this work, taking intelligent emotion detection and data mining algorithm into account, has some influence. The model and data mining algorithm are applied to evaluate college teachers' morality, the method effect is statistically evaluated, and the results showing the superiority of the proposed method are obtained.

TI Construction of Real-time Dynamic Reversible Lane Safety Control Model

LA English
DT Article
AB Reversible lanes play an important role in alleviating urban traffic congestion and improving the utilization of road resources. However, most of the reversible lanes currently implemented are timed and fixed, and there is little research on the safety of reversible lanes without isolation facilities. In view of the existing problems of reversible lanes, this paper proposed a real-time dynamic reversible lane safety control model. The influencing factors of reversible lane safety control are analyzed first, and then determine model parameters of the no-entry zone and the buffer zone in the conflict area. Moreover, model parameters of emptying, exit, and recovery zones in the operation process were determined as well. Additionally, this paper discussed the length of reversible lanes and the timing of signals. The surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) is adopted to analyze vehicle trajectory data for traffic simulation under different traffic flows. The experiment results show that the proposed reversible lane safety control scheme can keep the vehicle's traffic conflict rate below 5%, which can effectively ensure the safe operation of the reversible lane.

DT Article
AB In today's world, agriculture is one of the most important assets as it affects the economy of the country. Biotic stress caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses is common in plants; hence plant disease recognition is essential as it could identify diseases at the early stages of infection. Most of the previous plant disease works involve PlantVillage dataset, which is taken in a controlled environment. In this paper, the Banana leaf dataset is used which is combined from two datasets. CNNs are becoming more popular in many forms, such as pre-trained models, and in this research, we employed a pre-trained model in conjunction with an ML classifier to predict plant disease. Pre-trained models such as VGG 16, RESNET, MobileNet, InceptionResNetV2, Inception, and Xception models were deployed for feature extraction. Based on the above models, the proposed Xception-RF model achieved 100% accuracy with no misclassified classes. Using an Xception model with depth-wise convolutions reduces the number of parameters and the cost of implementation. The proposed work merges machine learning and deep learning by extracting features using CNN and then using ML-based RF for classification, which has resulted in an increase in performance in terms of accuracy.

AB Model-based clustering technique is an optimal choice for the distribution of data sets and to find the real structure using mixture of probability distributions. Many extensions of model-based clustering algorithms are available in the literature for getting most favorable results but still its challenging and important research objective for researchers. In the model-based clustering, many proposed methods are based on EM algorithm to overcome its sensitivity and initialization. However, these methods treat data points with feature (variable) components under equal importance, and so cannot distinguish the irrelevant feature components. In most of the cases, there exist some irrelevant features and outliers/noisy points in a data set, upsetting the performance of clustering algorithms. To overcome these issues, we propose a fuzzy model-based t-clustering algorithm using mixture of t-distribution with an L 1 regularization for the identification and selection of better features. In order to demonstrate its novelty and usefulness, we apply our algorithm on artificial and real data sets. We further used our proposed method on soil data set, which was collected in collaboration with and the assistance of Environmental laboratory Karakoram International University (GB) from various point/places of Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. The comparison results validate the novelty and superiority of our newly proposed method for both the simulated and real data sets as well as effectiveness in addressing the weaknesses of existing methods.

AB Crop yield forecasting has been well studied in recent decades and is significant in protecting food security. Crop growth is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors. Machine learning and deep learning trends have emerged as important innovations in this field. We propose to utilize crop, weather, and soil data from agricultural datasets to evaluate yield prediction behavior. Paddy being a staple food crop in India is chosen for this research. In this paper, we propose hybrid architecture for paddy yield prediction, namely, MLR-LSTM, which combines Multiple Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory to utilize their complementary nature. The results are compared with traditional machine learning methods such as Support vector machine, Long short-term memory and Random forest method. Evaluation metrics such as Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), F1 score, Recall, and Precision are used to evaluate the hybrid method and traditional models. The results obtained from the proposed hybrid method indicates that the hybrid model delivers better R-2, RMSE, MAE, MSE values of 0.93, 0.1549, 0.199, and 0.024 respectively.

TI A Supervised Model of Multivariable Control in Quadruple Tank System
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Aims to develop a precise mathematical model for multi-loop system-based Quadruple Tank Process (QTP) - a challenging task, due to strong interaction between pump inputs and sensor values. Modeling is essential for understanding the behavior of quadruple tank system, analysis and design of controllers. Traditional methods such as transfer function and state space model limitations are removed through the proposed model. Transfer function model can never be applied to multiple input and multiple output QTP system. State space model never addresses the internal state of QTP system. In this paper, Machine Learning-based Quadruple Tank Process model is proposed such as Regression Tree Quadruple Tank Process (RT-QTP) model and Support Vector Machine Quadruple Tank Process (SVM-QTP) model for runtime input and output sensor level data from laboratory based QTP station. Regression technique is performed with pump inputs and output liquid level data and it is verified with R-square values of proposed models. The models provide an accuracy of about 98% for laboratory-based data from a QTP station, according to experiments using MATLAB software.

TI Event Log Privacy Based on Differential Petri Nets
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Process mining uses event logs to improve business processes, but such logs may contain privacy information. One popular research problem is the privacy protection of event logs. Publishing logs with differential privacy is one of major research directions. Existing research achieves privacy protection primarily by injecting random noise into event logs, or merging similar information. The former ignores the fact that injecting random noise will produce apparently unreasonable activity traces, and the latter will cause a loss of process information in the process mining perspective. To solve the above problems, this article proposes a differential algorithm based on randomized response to model Petri nets for the original event logs, select the important labels in the logs by the weak sequential relationship of control flow between activities, inject noise into the Petri net model based on the important labels using the randomized response approach, and establish a differential Petri net model. Experiments on public datasets show that the event logs produced by the approach proposed do not contain unreasonable traces. Compared with the baseline approach, the proposed approach performs better on Fitness metrics with consistent privacy requirements and retains more process variants, reducing the loss of original event log process information.

AB Recently, with the vigorous development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, all kinds of intelligent home appliances in the market are constantly innovating. The public requirements for residential safety and convenience are also increasing. Meanwhile, with the improvement of indigenous medical technology and quality of life, people's average lifespan is gradually increasing. However, countries around the world are facing the problem of aging societies. Hand gesture recognition is gaining popularity in the fields of gesture control, robotics, or medical applications. Therefore, how to create a convenient and smart control system of home appliances for the elderly or the disabled has become the objective of this study. It aims to use Google MediaPipe to develop a hand tracking system, which detected 21 key points of a hand through the camera lens of a mobile device and used a vector formula to calculate the angle of the intersection of two lines based on four key points. After the angle of bending finger is obtained, users' hand gesture can be recognized. Our experiments have confirmed that the recognition precision and recall values of hand gesture for numbers 0-9 reached 98.80% and 97.67%, respectively; and the recognition results were used to control home appliances through the low-cost IoT-Enabled system.

AB The current research describes the use of e-mail reply suggestions from a socio-cultural perspective of some language-related variables. It also correlates how users perceive the use of e-mail reply suggestions to some variables: job, specialization, age, and gender. In this descriptive-inferential survey design, a self-developed questionnaire was distributed online to collect the data from a convenient sample of e-mail users. The analysis shows the study sample perceived medially the use of e-mail reply suggestions. There are statistically significant differences in the respondents' means about using e-mail reply suggestions according to the variable of job for education, specialization for humanities, and gender for females. Also, ages of less than 30 and above 50 years are of significance in using e-mail reply suggestions. The study reveals a weak inverse correlation, however, statistical between using e-mail reply suggestions and the language of those suggestions. In addition, a statistically significant positive direct correlation is found between usability and culture and society of e-mail reply suggestions. In light of the findings, the study recommends the better implementation of artificial intelligence-mediated communication in e-mail reply suggestions in association with some sociolinguistic factors. Also, future related studies are suggested.

AB The present study aims to compare and analyze the performance of two tokenizers, Mecab-Ko and SentencePiece, in the context of natural language processing for sentiment analysis. The study adopts a comparative approach, employing five algorithms - Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) - to evaluate the performance of each tokenizer. The performance was assessed based on four widely used metrics in the field, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicated that SentencePiece performed better than Mecab-Ko. To ensure the validity of the results, paired t-tests were conducted on the evaluation outcomes. The study concludes that SentencePiece demonstrated superior classification performance, especially in the context of ANN and LSTM-RNN, when used to interpret customer sentiment based on Korean online reviews. Furthermore, SentencePiece can assign specific meanings to short words or jargon commonly used in product evaluations but not defined beforehand.

TI Improving Face Recognition by Integrating Decision Forest into GAN
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Posture variation and self-occlusion are well-known factors that can compromise the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems. There are a variety of ways to combat the challenges listed above, include using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Nevertheless, many GAN methods cannot guarantee high-quality frontal-face images, which can improve recognition accuracy and verification when applied to multiple datasets. Recent results have proven that the two-pathway GAN (TP-GAN) method is superior to many traditional GAN deep learning methods that provide better face-texture details due to a unique architecture that enables the method to perceive global structure and local details in a supervised fashion. Although the TP-GAN overcomes some of the difficulties associated with generating photorealistic frontal views through the use of texture information provided by landmark detection and synthesis functions, it is difficult to replicate across different datasets. Particularly, under extreme pose scenarios, TP-GAN fails to further boost photo-realistic face frontalization image samples, minimizes the training time, and reduces computational resources, all of which result in substantially lower performance. This paper proposes simple adaptive strategies for overcoming TP-GAN's inherent limitations. First, we incorporate the powerful discrimination capabilities of a decision forest into the discriminator of a TP-GAN. This method will result in a more stable discriminator model over time. Secondly, we acclimate a data augmentation technique along with a method which reduces training errors and accelerates the convergence of existing learning algorithms. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on three datasets, Multi-PIE, FEI and CAS-PEAL. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our proposed approaches can enhance TP-GAN performance by restoring identity information contaminated by variations in posture and self-occlusion, resulting in high quality visualizations and rank-1 individual face identification.

AB A novel machine learning method, named CatBoost-DF (CatBoost deep forest), is proposed to solve this existing problem of low accuracy and lack of practicality in thermal sensation prediction. In the CatBoost-DF, a cascading strategy is introduced to strengthen the association between each layer of CatBoost. To verify the accuracy and robustness of CatBoost-DF, experiments collected physiological and environmental data from hundreds of subjects with the help of sensor devices and questionnaires. Compared with existing state-of-the-art machine learning methods, CatBoost-DF shows significant superiority, with a prediction accuracy of 90%, which is 4%-39% higher than other models. Moreover, the study explored the effects of seasonal and gender factors on thermal sensation. Result shown that different seasons have different thermal sensation for males and females. Finally, CatBoost-DF is applied to predict occupants' thermal sensation, and the "comfort range" of the important parameters HR, WS, and CTR that affect the thermal sensation is calculated experimentally.

TI DR-CIML: Few-shot Object Detection via Base Data Resampling and
   Cross-iteration Metric Learning
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Aiming at the problems of difficult data collection and labor-intensive manual annotation, few-shot object detection (FSOD) has gained wide attention. Although current transfer-learning-based detection methods outperform meta-learning-based methods, their data organization fails to fully utilize the diversity of the source domain data. In view of this, Data Resampling (DR) organization is proposed to fine-tune the network, which can be employed as a component of any model and dataset without additional inference overhead. In addition, in order to improve the generalization of the model, a Cross-Iteration Metric-Learning (CIML) branch is embedded in the few-shot object detector, thus actively improving intra-category feature propinquity and inter-category feature discrimination. Our generic DR-CIML approach obtained competitive scores in extensive comparative experiments. The nAP50 performance on PASCAL VOC improved by up to 6.3 points, and the bAP50 performance reached 81.0, surpassing the base stage model (80.8) for the first time. The nAP75 performance on MS COCO improved by up to 1.6 points.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is present everywhere in the lives of individuals. Unfortunately, several cases of discrimination by AI systems have already been reported. Scholars have warned on risks of AI reproducing existing inequalities or even amplifying them. To tackle these risks and promote responsible AI, many ethics guidelines for AI have emerged recently, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles and practices. However, little is known about the DEI content of these guidelines, and to what extent they meet the most relevant accumulated knowledge from DEI literature. We performed a semi-systematic literature review of the AI guidelines regarding DEI stakes and analyzed 46 guidelines published from 2015 to today. We fleshed out the 14 DEI principles and the 18 DEI practices recommended underlying these 46 guidelines. We found that the guidelines mostly encourage one of the DEI management paradigms, namely fairness, justice, and nondiscrimination, in a limited compliance approach. We found that narrow technical practices are favored over holistic ones. Finally, we conclude that recommended practices for implementing DEI principles in AI should include actions aimed at directly influencing AI actors' behaviors and awareness of DEI risks, rather than just stating intentions and programs.

   Representation Learning for Pattern Classification

ID K-SVD; FACE RECOGNITION; SPARSE; DICTIONARY
AB In recent years, analysis dictionary learning (ADL) model has attracted much attention from researchers, owing to its scalability and efficiency in representation-based classification. Despite the supervised label information embedding, the classification performance of analysis representation suffers from the redundant and noisy samples in real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a joint Dual-Structural constrained and Non-negative Analysis Representation (DSNAR) learning model. First, the supervised latent structural transformation term is considered implicitly to generate a roughly block diagonal representation for intra-class samples. However, this discriminative structure is fragile and weak in the presence of noisy and redundant samples. To highlight both intra-class similarity and inter-class separation for class-oriented representation, we then explicitly incorporate an off-block suppressing term on the ADL model, together with a non-negative representation constraint, to achieve a well-structured and meaningful interpretation of the contributions from all class-oriented atoms. Moreover, a robust classification scheme in latent space is proposed to avoid accidental incorrect predictions with noisy information. Finally, the DSNAR model is alternatively solved by the K-SVD method, iterative re-weighted method and gradient method efficiently. Extensive classification results on five benchmark datasets validate the performance superiority of our DSNAR model compared to other state-of-the-art DL models.

ID ANALYTICS; FRAMEWORK
AB Artificial intelligence applications have revolutionized business, industry, and education. Applications developed for other sectors are being adapted for education. The amount of data being generated by educational institutions is used to make recommendations for a wide range of areas. The study uses bibliometric analysis to evaluate the development and growth of recommender systems in higher education. Two hundred seventy-two (272) articles published between 2007 and 2021 in the Scopus database were utilized to collect data. The study examines the different patterns such as publication trends, the relative growth rate (RGR) and doubling time (DT) for publications. Results show a steady increase in publications, with 2017 recording the highest number of publications. China, Spain and the United States have the highest publications. The mean RGR decreased, and the mean doubling time increased in the three-five-year periods. The study identified sixteen themes covered by the research articles analyzed. Most articles focused on e-learning, followed by classroom activities and, thirdly, those focusing on course selection. The study provides essential insights into current and future research on recommender systems in higher education. This analysis helps researchers, policymakers, and practitioners better understand the development of recommender systems in higher education and possible practice implications.

AB This paper focuses on the finite-time tracking control problem of fractional-order multi-agent systems subject to input saturation and constraints. The interaction topology is assumed to be directed and contain a spanning tree. The appropriate barrier Lyapunov functions are constructed to tackle the output and partial states constraints. Since only the system output is available, a reduced-order state observer is constructed to obtain the unmeasurable state variables. Fuzzy logic system is applied to tackle the uncertain nonlinear dynamics in the system and the unknown parameters are estimated by adaptive laws. An event-triggered control scheme is designed to reduce communication burden. The proposed distributed controller can guarantee that all signals of the system are bounded, the constrained states never breach the time-varying constraints, finite-time tracking can be achieved with a bounded error and the Zeno behavior does not occur. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated by an example.

TI Detection of Hate Speech using BERT and Hate Speech Word Embedding with
   Deep Model
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB There is an increased demand for detecting online hate speech, especially with the recent changing policies of hate content and free-of-speech right of online social media platforms. Detecting hate speech will reduce its negative impact on social media users. A lot of effort in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field aimed to detect hate speech in general or detect specific hate speech such as religion, race, gender, or sexual orientation. Hate communities tend to use abbreviations, intentional spelling mistakes, and coded words in their communication to evade detection, which adds more challenges to hate speech detection tasks. Word representation from its domain will play an increasingly pivotal role in detecting hate speech. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging domain-specific word embedding as features and a bidirectional LSTM-based deep model as a classifier to automatically detect hate speech. This approach guarantees that the word is assigned its negative meaning, which is a very helpful technique to detect coded words. Furthermore, we investigate the use of the transfer learning language model (BERT) on the hate speech problem as a binary classification task as it provides high-performance results for many NLP tasks. The experiments showed that domain-specific word embedding with the bidirectional LSTM-based deep model achieved a 93% f1-score, while BERT achieved 96% f1-score on a combined balanced dataset from available hate speech datasets. The results proved that the performance of pre-trained models is influenced by the size of the trained data. Although there is a huge variation in the corpus size, the first approach achieved a very close result compared to BERT, which is trained on a huge data corpus, this is because it is trained on data related to the same domain. The first approach was very helpful to detect coded words while the second approach achieved better performance because it is trained on much larger data. To conclude, it is very helpful to build large pre-trained models from rich domains specific content in current social media platforms.

AB In this paper, we have introduced a differential perturbation operator into the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm using three randomly selected omega wolves which assist the three leader wolves of the original GWO algorithm for diversifying the solution quality among the feasible omega wolves. Additionally, we have introduced the use of similar values for the control parameters (A and C) of GWO for each leader wolf while updating the position of a single omega wolf. This diversification among the omega wolves introduces an element of exploration in the exploitation phase and hence further improves the optimization capability of the GWO algorithm. For comparative performance analysis, the results obtained from the proposed algorithm are compared with ten promising recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithms such as IAOA, RSA, mGWOA, VWGWO, mGWO, GWO, SCA, JAYA, ALO and WOA in optimizing 23 mathematical benchmark unimodal, multimodal and fixed dimension functions. Additionally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested in 12 promising data clustering problems using four performance measures such as accuracy, precision, F-score and MCC. Superiority of the proposed algorithm in optimizing benchmark functions and data clustering is statistically verified using pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Friedman and Nemenyi hypothesis test.

AB Early identification of potato diseases is of great significance for reducing yield losses. The identification of different types of diseases has achieved great success. However, for different periods of different disease, it is difficult to distinguish due to similar symptoms and fine-grained, so there are few related studies. In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network based on contrastive learning to identify fine-grained potato diseases. Different from the previous unsupervised contrastive learning used in pre-training, the proposed model adds a projection head to the backbone network of Vgg16 to extract the contrastive representation features, and then integrates the contrastive loss with the classification loss to form a joint loss. Finally, an end-to-end supervised contrastive convolutional neural network is constructed, which is easier to train while reducing the transmission error. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an average recognition accuracy of 97.24%, which is higher than 90.28% of Resnet50, 90.62% of Resnet101, 93.06% of AlexNet, 94.44% of Inception V3, and 94.79% of Vgg16. It shows that the model has an obvious effect on classification task with similar features, and has practical significance for fine-grained potato disease identification.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Conversational Agents (CA) are increasingly being deployed by organizations to provide round-the-clock support and to increase customer satisfaction. All CA have one thing in common despite the differences in their design: they need to be trained with users' intents and corresponding training sentences. Access to proper data with acceptable coverage of intents and training sentences is a big challenge in CA deployment. Even with the access to the past conversations, the process of discovering intents and training sentences manually is not time and cost-effective. Here, an end to end automated framework that can discover intents and their training sentences in conversation logs to generate labeled data sets for training intent models is presented. The framework proposes different feature engineering techniques and leverages dimensionality reduction methods to assemble the features, then applies a density-based clustering algorithm iteratively to mine even the least common intents. Finally, the clustering results are automatically labeled by the final algorithm.

AB Renewable energy can help India's economy and society. Solar energy is everywhere and can be used anywhere, making it popular. Solar energy's drawbacks are weather and environmental dependencies and solar radiation variations. Solar Radiation Forecasting (SRF) reduces this drawback. SRF eliminates solar power generation variations, grid overvoltage, reverse current, and islanding. Short-term solar radiation forecasts improve photovoltaic (PV) power generation and grid connection. Previous promising SRF studies often fail to generalize to new data. A biogeography-based optimization artificial neural network (BBO-ANN) model for SRF is proposed in this work. 5-year and 6-year data are used to train and validate the model. The data was collected from India's Jaipur Rajasthan weather station from 2014 to 2019. This work used biogeography-based optimization (BBO) to optimize and adjust the inertia weight of artificial neural networks (ANN) during training. The BBO-ANN model developed in this study had a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.55%, which is promising compared to previous SRF studies. The BBO-ANN SRF model introduced in this work can generalize well to new data because it was able to produce equally accurate autumn and winter forecasts despite the great climatic variation that occurs during the summer and spring.

AB Predicting the air temperature based on spatially accurate simulations is helpful to agricultural production, commercial activities, air transportation, water transportation, power supply, and national defense. Traditional prediction is not generally based on the time series obtained from multiple meteorological stations and from a spatial perspective. In this study, a deep convolution neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) is constructed to extract the spatiotemporal features of temperature and the correlation between meteorological elements. The accuracies of the simulated and the predicted temperatures are spatially visualized by using the Kriging interpolation method. The accuracy of air temperature obtained from the CNN-LSTM was compared with those obtained from the CNN and the LSTM to verify its performance. The results show that there were prominent spatial variations in the temperature, with a latitudinal zonal structure in the southern Ningxia and a radial zonal structure in the northern Ningxia, China. The accuracies of the simulated and predicted temperature were high in areas with a small range of the annual temperature. The accuracies of the mean monthly temperature simulated by the CNN-LSTM in spring and autumn were higher than that in the summer. The predicted annual average temperature increased each year from 2020 to 2025. The CNN-LSTM had a higher accuracy of simulating and predicting the temperature as well as a better generalization ability than the CNN and LSTM.

AB This study mainly discusses extended admissibility and fuzzy parallel distributed compensation (PDC) control issues for discrete singular fuzzy systems with multiple difference matrices existing in the rules. By the overall system associated with the discrete singular models with multiple difference matrices, we first propose an extended admissibility analysis criteria, where the new results not only involve some slack matrices but also have a less number of linear matrix inequalities' (LMIs) constraints. Furthermore, by hiring the fuzzy PDC, explicit design criteria are further developed for the regarded system. Noticeably, the new design method can cope with controller synthesis of the admissibility and D-admissibility issues. Due to all the presented criteria are formed by the strict LMIs, we can readily evaluate them via some existing LMI solvers. Finally, two numerical examples are involved to demonstrate the applicability and the feasibility of the developed results.

AB When scale builds up in a transmission pipeline, it narrows the pipe's interior and causes losses in both power and efficiency. A noninvasive instrument based on gamma-ray attenuation is one of the most reliable diagnostic procedures for determining volumetric percentages in a variety of circumstances. A system with a NaI detector and dual-energy gamma generator simulations (Am-241 and (13)3 Ba radioisotopes) is recommended for simulating a volume percentage detection system utilizing Monte Carlo N particle (MCNP). Three-phase flow consisting of oil, water, and gas moves through a scaled pipe of variable wall thicknesses in a stratified flow regime with changing volume percentages. After gamma rays are emitted from one end of the pipe, a detector take in the photons coming from the other end. Four temporal features, including kurtosis and mean value of the square root (MSR), skewness, and waveform length (WL) picked up by the detector, were thus obtained. By training two GMDH neural networks with the aforementioned inputs, it is possible to forecast volumetric percentages with an RMSE of less than 0.90 and independently of scale thickness. The low error value, simplicity of the system, and reduction of design costs ensures the effectiveness of the suggested method and the advantages of employing this approach in the petroleum and petrochemical industries.

AB The development of adversarial technology, represented by adversarial text, has brought new challenges to rumor detection based on deep learning. In order to improve the robustness of rumor detection models under adversarial conditions, we propose a robust detection method based on the ensemble of multi-defense model on the basis of several mainstream defense methods such as data enhancement, random smoothing, and adversarial training. First, multiple robust detection models are trained based on different defense principles; then, two different ensemble strategies are used to integrate the above models, and the detection effect under different ensemble strategies is studied. The test results on the open-source dataset Twitter15 show that the proposed method is able to compensate for the shortcomings of a single model by ensembling different decision boundaries to effectively defend against mainstream adversarial text attacks and improve the robustness of rumor detection models compared to existing defense methods.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) based conversational agent is widely used in the service industry. Although some studies have investigated the impact of AI on customers, little research has documented the concrete effects of AI-based conversational agents on firms' operational performance. To fill this gap, the main goal of this paper is to investigate the impacts of AI-based conversational agent on firms' operational performance. In addition, the moderating effect of time blocks is also investigated. We address questions using the event study method and a proprietary data set from a telecom firm in China. Results show that the introduction of an AI-based conversational agent increases the average call length and has no significant influence on call numbers. Moreover, there is a heterogeneous effect among different time blocks. Our findings provide important implications for the operational management of call center.

ID AIRBORNE POLLEN
AB Allergenic pollen affects the quality of life for over 30% of the European population. Since the treatment efficacy is highly related to the actual exposure to pollen, information about the type and number of airborne pollen grains in real-time is essential for reducing their impact. Therefore, the automation of pollen monitoring has become an important research topic. Our study is focused on the Rapid-E real-time bioaerosol detector. So far, vanilla convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the only deep architectures evaluated for pollen classification on multi-modal Rapid-E data obtained by exposing collected pollen samples of known classes to the device in a controlled environment. This study contributes to the further development of pollen classification models on Rapid-E data by experimenting with more advanced concepts of CNNs, residual, and inception networks. Our experiments included a comprehensive comparison of different CNN architectures, and obtained results provided valuable insights into which convolutional blocks improve pollen classification. We propose a new model which, coupled with a specific training strategy, improves the current state-of-the-art by reducing its relative error rate by 9%.

DT Article
AB This paper presents an object attitude estimation method using a 2D object image for a Laser Beam Control Research Testbed (LBCRT). Motivated by emerging Deep Learning (DL) techniques, a DL model that can estimate the attitude of a rotating object represented by Euler angles is developed. Instead of synthetic data for training and validation of the model, customized data is experimentally created using the laboratory testbed developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. The data consists of Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) images of a 3D-printed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model with varying attitudes and associated Euler angle labels. In the testbed, the estimated attitude is used to aim a laser beam to a specific point of the rotating model UAV object. The attitude estimation model is trained with 1684 UAV images and validated with 421 UAV images not used in the model training. The validation results show the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) angle estimation errors of 6.51 degrees in pitch, 2.74 degrees in roll, and 2.51 degrees in yaw. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is also integrated to show the reduced RMS estimation errors of 1.36 degrees in pitch, 1.20 degrees in roll, and 1.52 degrees in yaw.

ID EVOLUTION; COOPERATION
AB A variety of social dilemma scenarios are studied within the context of the prisoner's dilemma, one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory, and its variants. In the prisoner's dilemma, studies typically emphasize the priority of maximizing the gain of each individual. In this paper, however, we focus on maximizing the benefit of the larger group, not each individual. It is worth noting that regardless of individual strategies in the prisoner's dilemma, there is always a certain level of defection. These individual defections can be analyzed in a collective group setting from the perspective of game theory. We look into how much defection is required, if necessary, in order to optimize a group's advantages, and analytically identify the specific effects of defection for the purpose of maximizing group benefit.

AB Sound event detection involves detecting acoustic events of multiple classes in audio recordings, along with the times of occurrence. Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) Task 4 for sound event detection in domestic environments is a contest on this task. In this paper, we engineer sound event detection systems using the data provided and the performance metrics defined in this contest. Note the performance metrics of polyphonic sound detection scores (PSDS) in 2 scenarios are adopted recently to be practical and effective. Our system development started with a basic system through reference to various systems in the contests of previous years. We developed a system similar to that used by the winning team in DCASE Challenge 2021. A clip-level consistency branch is then added to the model architecture to increase the performance of the PSDS in scenario 2, which focuses on identifying different event classes. In addition, we use knowledge distillation with the mean teacher model to improve system performance. In this way, the model can learn from the pre-trained model without being fully restricted by its performance. Finally, we further enhance the system robustness through consistency criteria in the second stage of training. On the official validation set of Domestic Environment Sound Event Detection (DESED) dataset, our final system achieves 0.418 and 0.661 on the PSDS in the two scenarios. It outperforms the 2021 baseline system with 0.341 and 0.546 on both scores quite significantly.

AB The service stability of industrial robots (IRs) is considered the basis for ensuring intelligent manufacturing operations. Knowledge-based work plays a central role in the practical application of intelligent manufacturing because the staff have professional knowledge of production and manufacturing after learning, undergoing training, and thinking. They can use their knowledge to analyze complex states, assess them accurately, and make innovative decisions. Therefore, expressing and constructing IR data and knowledge is a key issue in the application of knowledge to the predictive maintenance (PdM) of IRs. Considering the intelligent management of IRs as the research objective of this study, a PdM method based on data and knowledge was developed. A running-state feature-recognition model based on a long short-term memory network was first established to recognize future running states using the history and real-time running data of IRs. Furthermore, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to analyze the correlation between the running-state feature data and faults to predict possible faults. The prediction results were then input into the knowledge graphs (KGs) of IRs for reasoning. PdM strategies were automatically formulated based on the KGs. Finally, a PdM system for IRs was designed and developed. The effectiveness of the proposed method and system were verified by applying them to the welding robots in a new energy automotive welding workshop. The findings of this study provide new concepts and tools for the PdM of IRs, as well as theoretical and methodological support for the production stability of intelligent manufacturing.1

AB Stock forecasting plays a pivotal role in time series forecasting as it enables informed and effective investment decisions by minimizing risks. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for stock price forecasting is proposed to explore the impact of a decomposition-reconstruction method fused with machine learning models, aiming to enhance the predictive ability of the model. Following the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction principle, the hybrid model incorporates wavelet transform, integrating Encoder Forest (EF) with Informer. To mitigate the influence of long-time series noise on stock forecasting, the original data is decomposed into high-frequency signal components (CD) and low-frequency signal components (CA). The Informer and Encoder Forest are trained to predict the future CA and CD, respectively. The hybrid model is implemented for all stocks in three industries of the china stock market. Several models including MLR, RNN, LSTM, Informer, WT + RNN + DT, WT + LSTM + RF, EMD + Informer + EF, VMD + Informer + EF, CEEMD + Informer + EF, and CEEMDAN + Informer + EF are designed as compared methods to verify the superiority and advancement of the proposed technique. Evaluating the performance of individual models reveals that the prediction accuracy follows the ranking: MLR < RNN < LSTM < Informer. Comparing the results of the hybrid model with those of the individual models demonstrates that the hybrid model improves prediction accuracy. This comparison also indicates that the wavelet transform and tree models can enhance the accuracy of the model without altering the initial ranking of the prediction effect. It is worth noting that WT and EMD-like methods employ different data decomposition approaches, leading to diverse outcomes. Experimental results indicate that WT is better suited for a hybrid model that combines two distinct methods. All experimental results indicated that the proposed hybrid model has higher prediction accuracy, stronger generalization ability, and stronger practicability, which is more suitable for Stock forecasting problems.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, online social media platforms such as Twitter facilitate the exchange of information among people. However, the prevalence of "infodemic"such as online hate speech has exacerbated social rifts, discrimination, prejudice and even hate crimes. Timely and effective detection of the hate speech will help create a healthy public opinion environment. Most of the current COVID-19-related hate speech research focuses on a single language, such as English. In this paper, we introduce a cross-lingual transfer learning method, aiming to contribute to hate speech detection in low-resource languages. We propose a deep learning based model to classify hate speech with a pre-trained language model for multilingual text embedding. Data augmentation and cross-lingual contrastive learning are then utilized to further improve the performance of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. To evaluate our method, we collected three publicly available annotated COVID-19-related hate speech datasets on Twitter, i.e., two in English and one in German. Furthermore, a Chinese dataset based on Weibo is constructed to expand multilingual data. The experimental results across three languages illustrate the effectiveness of our method for cross-lingual hate speech detection. Test F1-scores of our method for English, Chinese, German as transfer target languages can reach up to 0.728, 0.799 and 0.612 respectively, which are on average better than other baselines.

AB Modern chemical process industry is becoming larger and more complicated to achieve a higher level of technical functionality. There is less tolerance for functional degeneration, productivity retrogression, and safety hazards, which significantly leads to an ever-increasing demand on detecting any potential faults as early as possible. In reality, chemical process data are continuous generated with imbalanced fault patterns, which leads to the fault diagnosis models failing to assign the same attention to minority fault patterns as the majority and further leads to the lack of generalization ability. In the present study, a novel adaptive imbalance modified online broad learning system (AIM-OBLS) is developed to promote fault diagnosis in the contexts of imbalanced chemical process data streams. The proposed AIM-OBLS is developed on a flat linear network, which can excavate potential information efficiently in an incremental manner. An adaptive imbalance modified method combined with the Niche technique, oversampling technique, and manifold regularization is presented for imbalanced data streams modification. The advantages of the proposed AIM-OBLS are demonstrated on two widely used industrial datasets. Experimental results indicate that AIM-OBLS can effectively deal with the imbalance chemical process data streams. The performance of AIM-OBLS is competitive in terms of both diagnosis accuracy and time consumption.

AB High dimensionality is one of the main challenges in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) classification modeling, and feature selection as an effective dimensionality reduction method plays an important role in machine learning, particularly in fields such as chemometrics. In this paper, for feature selection in QSAR classification modeling, a hybrid whale optimization algorithm (WOA) with a chameleon hunting mechanism (HWOA-CHM) is proposed, and its binary version is used to find the best subset for wrapper feature selection in the QSAR classification model. First, a chaos weighting factor is introduced and used as a perturbation factor to increase the diversity of populations. Second, a retractable transformation strategy is designed to prevent the HWOA-CHM from falling into a local optimum. Third, the chameleon predation mechanism is introduced to improve the convergence accuracy of the HWOA-CHM. The performance of HWOA-CHM is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art classical algorithms and well-known WOA variants. Then, a binary HWOA-CHM (BHWOA-CHM) was designed to solve the feature selection, the BHWOA-CHM is validated using the UCI machine learning repository and compared with binary version WOA, and well-known WOA variants in terms of accuracy, number of features, and time. Finally, BHWOA-CHM was used to solve the high-dimensional feature selection problem in the drug-induced liver injury classification model. It has shown excellent results in terms of feature selection compared to other methods. The proposed method effectively improves the robustness of QSAR predictions while reducing the complexity of the feature sets, demonstrating its potential for improving the accuracy of QSAR models.

AB CHEIC (Chemical Image Classificator) is a web platform that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns of volatile molecules from microorganisms with potential against respiratory and bronchopulmonary diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 and asthma. The platform lets users find volatile molecules with biological activity through molecular docking. This work presents the functionalities of the CHEIC platform, which accommodates a Deep Learning model with 93% accuracy in classifying volatile compounds and candidate molecules for respiratory disease drugs. The artificial intelligence model indicated that out of 548 molecules used, 39 exhibited drug-like molecular features. By combining the indicative results of molecular docking emitted by the CHEIC platform with further analysis using 100 ns of Molecular Dynamics trajectory, four volatile compounds were found with the potential to modulate proteins associated with respiratory tract diseases such as asthma and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, CHEIC is a free and promising tool in the search for therapeutic agents for respiratory diseases, as well as providing valuable and fast insights for researchers interested in omics sciences.

AB We consider the problem of ranking two-level efficient decision-making units (DMUs) in a hierarchical group structure. Traditionally, the radial hierarchical data envelopment analysis (DEA) models were used, but these are based on the assumption that there are proportional changes in inputs or outputs. To address this shortcoming, non-radial DEA models, capable of dealing with slacks directly are commonly used. To minimise the bias associated with using a single super-efficiency (SE) model, seven diversified SE models are extended to suit an environment with DMUs structured as hierarchical groups. The seven SE ratings of the suburb and district locations as potential locations of mobile money agents reveal wide variations. A proposed group technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) ranking method is applied for harmonising the ratings and ensuring a complete ranking of efficient suburb locations. A complete ranking is achieved for all the district and suburb locations. The TOPSIS results are moderately well-verified and validated by the principal component analysis and Spearman correlation analysis methods. The accuracy of the district location TOPSIS rankings on the final suburb location TOPSIS rankings was discovered to be moderate at 61 percent.

AB Price forecasting is critical for business management decision making and planning. However, accurate price predicting faces daunting challenges due to data drift and performance degradation. To this end, we propose a dynamic ensemble prediction method by introducing a "metabolic mechanism" and building an effective investment decision support platform. We generated ten individual models and provided eight ensemble strategies under static and dynamic scenarios to test and verify the model's prediction performance. The results reveal that the dynamic model presents excellent performance, obtaining the slightest prediction error and the most negligible fluctuation risk. Moreover, under the same ensemble strategies, the dominance of the dynamic model was verified by the improvement rate. The dynamic model can deliver more successful trading signals, demonstrating its importance in investment decisions. Thus, the proposed model benefits practitioners and plays a significant supporting role in investment decision making.

ID GESTURE RECOGNITION
AB We designed an interface to support hand rehabilitation tasks to restore hand function and relieve discomfort. The interface requires accurate hand segmentation, which is impeded by background clutter, occlusion, and variations in illumination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel encoder-decoder that segments the hand by encoding spatial and channel correlations using two attention blocks. This approach requires much less computation than benchmark self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, a novel loss function optimizes the model to resolve class imbalance, ensure boundary smoothness, and retain the hand's shape. The quantitative and qualitative results show the model's ability to segment the hands. It performed exceptionally well for images with different hand poses and orientations, the presence of a human face, background clutter, specularity, and variations in illumination. The model attained an F1-score of 97.3% for the Ouhands and 99.3% for the HGR dataset, higher than baseline models, with faster inference times. Furthermore, the model could generalize hand segmentation to multiple hands and unseen environments. Its segmentation precision enabled the development of the hand rehabilitation interface, which guided users to perform hand exercises. For five weeks, patients steadily improved hand function while using the interface.

   detection; Interpretability; Rough Set theory
ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB In machine learning, interpretability is paramount, and identifying interactions in data is a key component in creating interpretable models. Despite Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) being inherently interpretable due to their usage of interaction detection, they are constrained in their ability to explore the whole sample space for variable interactions and frequently presuppose uniform interactions with the target variable(s). To counter this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid model named Rough-AssociationRule-Generalized Linear Model (RAGL). The RAGL model leverages Rough Set theory to detect interaction terms via information granulation and subsequently generates decision rules from these terms using association rule mining. These rules encapsulate the detected interactions, converted into binary values and incorporated as new predictive variables in the GLM model. Our study demonstrates that RAGL can discern interactions across a given dataset's sample space and employ important interaction terms for predictive purposes. The efficacy of our proposed model is validated using two benchmark Kaggle datasets - one for heart disease and the other for PIMA and a real weather dataset from Kariki_farm in Juja, Kenya. We juxtapose it against the classical GLM, decision trees, and Naive Bayes models. Our findings show that RAGL significantly outperforms these models in terms of both accuracy and interpretability, with a predictive accuracy of 92.3% for heart disease and PIMA datasets and 90.5% for the Kariki_farm weather station data. The RAGL model provides an enhanced interpretation of variable interactions within the data compared to the classical GLM model, thus offering more insightful coefficients for feature interpretation. Additionally, it presents lower Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) values than the classical GLM model, suggesting improved model fit and parsimony. Thus, our principal contribution lies in a hybrid, interpretable model that employs Rough Set theory and association rule mining to uncover feature interactions and bolsters the accuracy and interpretability of the GLM model.

ID INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION
AB Influence estimation aims to predict the total influence spread in social networks and has received surged attention in recent years. Most current studies focus on estimating the total number of influenced users in a social network, and neglect susceptibility estimation that aims to predict the probability of each user being influenced from the individual perspective. As a more fine-grained estimation task, susceptibility estimation is full of attractiveness and practical value. Based on the significance of susceptibility estimation and dynamic properties of social networks, we propose a task, called susceptibility estimation in dynamic social networks, which is even more realistic and valuable in real-world applications. Susceptibility estimation in dynamic networks has yet to be explored so far and is computationally intractable to naively adopt Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the results. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end framework DySuse based on dynamic graph embedding technology. Specifically, we leverage a structural feature module to independently capture the structural information of influence diffusion on each single graph snapshot. Besides, we propose the progressive mechanism according to the property of influence diffusion, to couple the structural and temporal information during diffusion tightly. Moreover, a self-attention block is designed to further capture temporal dependency by flexibly weighting historical timestamps. Experimental results show that our framework is superior to the existing dynamic graph embedding models and has satisfactory prediction performance in multiple influence diffusion models.

AB Examination is an effective method for evaluating educational achievements but manually grading is timeconsuming and error-prone. According to the characteristics of Chinese, this paper designs an effective and reliable hybrid automatic grading system for medical term interpretation questions, which integrates keyword similarity, semantic similarity and sentence length similarity. This model therefore provides a feasible framework in the sense that automated scoring system can be used reliably in real practice for subjective questions in medical education. In practice, the parameters can be pre-trained for different courses and different levels of students, so as to achieve the best performance of the model. From 15 professional noun explanation questions of 300 medical students in the course of medical psychology, statistics show that the difference between the manual and automatic assessment of all students' answers for each question is less than or equal to 2. Moreover, a comparative study of the automated scoring system is conducted to assess the overall testing performance. The experimental verification shows that the model posed in this paper is effective and robust. To enhance user convenience, a GUI software has been created using the Python "Tkinter" library. This software can be directly applied to different scenarios to demonstrate the expansive application potential of the system.

TI Mining frequent items from high-dimensional set-valued data under local

DE Local differential privacy; Frequent item mining
AB Mining frequent items from high-dimensional historical data (set-valued data) from massive users can extract the most routine data, playing a vital role in data mining. However, frequent item mining requires the collection of a large amount of user data, posing the potential risk of leaking user privacy. Local differential privacy is a mainstream privacy-preserving technique. It has been widely used for user privacy protection in various scenarios as it provides strict privacy protection. Mining frequent items from high-dimensional set-valued data under local differential privacy preservation has recently attracted much attention from researchers. Existing works usually use random sampling to reduce the communication cost of publishing perturbed data but hardly guarantee frequent item mining accuracy. This is because they sample minimal items from each user's high-dimensional set-value data (e.g., LDPMiner samples one item), making it difficult to focus on the scope of frequent item mining. The motivation of this paper to solve the above problem is that the frequent items mined from the data of a portion of users (e.g., half of the users) are similar to those mined from the data of the global users. Therefore, we randomly divide users into two groups and mine the set of candidate frequent items from the first group of users. Then, we focus on the candidate set in the second group of users and mine frequent items from it. Besides, we observe that the larger the sample size of user data, the better the frequent item mining accuracy and, subsequently, the higher the communication cost. Therefore, we randomly group the contents and randomly sample from each group, thus improving the frequent item mining accuracy by publishing more data than existing works. On this basis, we adaptively perturb the sampled group data according to the communication cost to trade off the communication cost and frequent item mining accuracy. Finally, we analyze the privacy and utility of our method theoretically. The experiments with state-of-the-art methods such as FIML, SVIM, and LDPMiner show that our proposed method improves about 15% in accuracy and 10% in utility for mining frequent items in high-dimensional set-valued data.

AB With the globalization and sustainable development of the modern manufacturing industry, distributed manufacturing and scheduling systems that consider environmental effects have attracted increasing attention. This article addresses the distributed flexible job-shop scheduling problem with crane transportation (DFJSPC) for minimizing the weighted sum of makespan and total energy consumption. In this study, we present a mixed integer linear programming model for DFJSPC and make a first attempt to propose a Q-learning-based hyperheuristic evolutionary algorithm (QHHEA) for solving such a strongly NP-hard problem. The QHHEA has the following features: (i) a hybrid population initialization method is designed to produce high-quality individuals with certain diversity; (ii) a novel left-shift decoding scheme is added to the decoding scheme to improve the utilization of machine processing and crane transportation resource; (iii) a Q-learning-based high-level strategy is developed to determine the most suitable low-level heuristic (LLH) from a pre-designed set based on valuable information fed by the efficacy of LLHs; (iv) a new state definition and a dynamic adaptive mechanism are used to balance population convergence and diversity; (v) an improved move acceptance method is adopted to avoid falling into local optima and to drive the search behavior toward promising regions. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons are conducted on a benchmark with 36 instances. The statistical results show that QHHEA outperforms several state-ofthe-art algorithms in solving DFJSPC.

AB Power lines (PLs) and transmission towers (TTs) detection from aerial images is the prerequisite step for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Unlike the previous works which only focus on PLs detection or TTs detection, this work aims to detect PLs and TTs together based on the instance segmentation algorithm. However, PLs and TTs in aerial images present numerous challenges to object detection and segmentation researchers-the slender characteristic of PLs, the foreground-background class imbalance, and the foreground-foreground class imbalance. To cope with the above challenges, this work proposes a corner-guided instance segmentation network (CGISnet) for detecting PLs and TTs together from aerial images. Specifically, an attention-based multiscale feature extraction module facilitates the extraction of the basic spatial feature information in the case of serious background noise interference. To accumulate more feature information about the objects, especially the slender objects, a corner-guided region of interest (ROI) align module detects the object as a pair of corners to obtain the corresponding ROI information for further segmentation. In addition, a weighted cross entropy loss function is utilized to resolve the foreground- foreground class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments were conducted on self-built and two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed CGISnet. The results demonstrate that our approach not only detects PLs and TTs with high accuracy, but also achieves competitive performance in detecting objects with different shapes and sizes.

AB The advent of connected vehicles (CVs) has enabled the availability of richer and more accurate data for more flexible and sophisticated traffic signal control. However, the complexity of optimization models, especially when individual vehicle trajectories are considered, makes solving existing CV-based signal control methods difficult. This study proposes a computationally efficient and refined signal control method for isolated intersections in a CV environment. A mixed-integer nonlinear program model, which minimizes the total vehicle travel time, is developed by employing a simplified car-following model to predict individual vehicle trajectories. To address the computational concerns, the signal optimization model is reformulated by clustering incoming vehicles into platoons and analyzing the platoon features based on the interactions between vehicles as well as between vehicles and traffic signals. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the proposed method with the adaptive signal and vehicle-actuated control methods. The results show significant reductions in vehicle travel time and fuel consumption compared to benchmark methods under different demand levels. Furthermore, the proposed control method has high computational efficiency with a solving time of less than 0.05 s, validating its potential for practical applications.

ID DATA-SETS; CLASSIFICATION; TRENDS
AB Imbalanced learning can be addressed in 3 different ways: Resampling, algorithmic modifications and cost sensitive solutions. Resampling, and specifically oversampling, are more general approaches when opposed to algorithmic and cost-sensitive methods. Since the proposal of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), various SMOTE variants and neural network-based oversampling methods have been developed. However, the options to oversample datasets with nominal and continuous features are limited. We propose Geometric SMOTE for Nominal and Continuous features (G-SMOTENC), based on a combination of G SMOTE and SMOTENC. Our method modifies SMOTENC's encoding and generation mechanism for nominal features while using G-SMOTE's data selection mechanism to determine the center observation and k nearest neighbors and generation mechanism for continuous features. G-SMOTENC's performance is compared against SMOTENC's along with two other baseline methods, a State-of-the-art oversampling method and no oversampling. The experiment was performed over 20 datasets with varying imbalance ratios, number of metric and non-metric features and target classes. We found a significant improvement in classification performance when using G-SMOTENC as the oversampling method. An open-source implementation of G-SMOTENC is made available in the Python programming language.

   Pointer-generator network; Copy mechanism; Prompt-tuning
AB Recently, large language models have shown great success on various abstractive summarization datasets. These datasets consist of numerous data that are enough to train a large number of parameters. However, for a new domain, there is a lack of labeled data to train those parameters and the model is easily overfitted to a small amount of data. In addition, because annotating document-summary pairs is too expensive and transfer learning using high-resource datasets causes a domain shifting problem, a low-resource abstractive summarization task is becoming necessary. Herein, we propose an efficient framework for low-resource abstractive summarization using a pointer-generator network and a meta-learning technique to address the above problems. Meta-learning using existing high-resource datasets enables our model to rapidly adapt to a new domain using limited data to solve the domain shifting problem. In addition, we explore the copy mechanism using a pointer-generator network that can copy words from a source document when generating a summary. The experimental results on 11 different datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models in low-resource abstractive summarization on most of the datasets.

AB There are more complex heterogeneous preference expressions and methods (HPEMs) in heterogeneous multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) with several attribute sets, which makes the effective fusion of HPEMs become an important challenge in practical applications. The paper aims to propose a stochasticintegration-based decision support framework for the unified fusion of various HPEMs and provide some feasible solution methods. The construction process of decision support framework is embodied in recombining and connecting the HPEMs into "information flows" according to the traditional multi-attribute decision making procedures. For the information flows, three types of solution methods, such as the global solution method, the simplified solution method, and the consistency-measure-based solution method, are proposed to transform them into a final superiority-probability-based pairwise comparison matrix (SPM). Based on the final SPM, a ranking method is developed that uses probabilities to present the superiority relationship between two alternatives. In addition, a comparison discussion is given to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the research. And two application examples are used to illustrate the validity of the proposed framework and solution methods. The decision support framework proposed in this paper is more open and inclusive, providing a feasible way for the unified fusion of various HPEMs. The proposed solution methods not only realize the sufficient solution, but also extend the decision results to probabilistic form, making the decision results more consistent with heterogeneous environment. The research in the paper can further enrich the methodology of heterogeneous MAGDM system and provide methods and technic support for complex group decision-making problems.

AB Considering deception attacks in communication networks, the paper investigates a novel integral-based event -triggering switched control scheme with an H & INFIN; norm bound for the LFC power system. To further reduce redundant signals transmission in the LFC network, a novel integral-based event-triggering mechanism (IETM) is constructed. The triggering condition depends on the integration of the system state over a past time period rather than the current sampling state value. Meanwhile, the waiting time in the IETM generator is set to avoid Zeno phenomenon. Hence, the IETM based switching control scheme of the LFC system considering deception attacks is established. Furthermore, through delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) with integral terms, the less conservative H & INFIN; asymptotic stability criterion is derived. And the controller design method based on the IETM switching control rule is obtained. In the end, the effectiveness and superiority of the designed IETM are validated based on a wind-connected power system example.

ID CORPUS
AB Text reuse is a process of creating new text(s) from pre-existing text(s). In recent years, Urdu Text Reuse Detection (UTRD) has gained the attention of researchers because the text is readily available in digital format all over the internet and can be copied or paraphrased from another source without proper attribution, which makes it easier to reuse but hard to detect. Text Reuse Detection (TRD) has many potential applications in Plagiarism detection, Paraphrase detection, Paraphrase generation, and Analysis of text reuse in web content. In recent years, Urdu Text Reuse Detection (UTRD) has gained the attention of researchers because the text is readily available in digital format all over the internet and can be copied or paraphrased from another source without proper attribution, which makes it easier to reuse but hard to detect. In previous studies, the problem of UTRD has been explored at the sentence level (Hafeez, 2022; Hafeez et al., 2023), sentence/passage level (Sameen et al., 2017), and document level (Sharjeel et al., 2017), along with benchmark corpora and approaches. However, the problem of UTRD has not been explored at the Phrasal level with respect to corpora and approaches. To fulfill this research gap, this research study has made a major contribution by developing a large benchmark manually annotated corpus of 25,001 text pairs at two levels of a rewrite: (1) Derived = 15,105 and (2) Non-Derived = 9896. In addition, we have developed, applied, evaluated, and compared baseline approaches (N-gram Overlap and Word Embedding-based approaches) with proposed Sentence Transformer-based approaches on the proposed UTRD-Phr-23 Corpus. As another contribution, we proposed a novel Sentence Transformers-based model (using a combination of eight different Sentence Transformers (ST) including paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2, distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v, paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2, LaBSE, xlm-r-distilroberta-base-paraphrase-v1, xlm-r-100langs-bert-base-nli-mean-tokens, xlm-r-bert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens, and xlm-r-100langs-bert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens). Our proposed model outperforms with an F1 score of 0.63 compared to the best results obtained using N-gram Overlap (baseline) approach (F1 = 0.53).

ID AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION
AB With rapid industrial developments, air pollution has become a hot issue globally. Accurate prediction of PM2.5 (a category of particulate pollutant with a diameter of less than 2.5 & mu;m) has been a critical topic, as it can provide valuable information for government decision-making and policy control in environmental management affairs. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the next 48hr PM2.5 concentration in Taiwan. In this model, monitoring stations are regarded as nodes and edges are the distances between monitoring stations. Hence, the distribution of the stations can be perceived as a graph. GNNs are promising in processing non-grid structure data that can be represented as a graph. By incorporating the GNN and gated recurrent units (GRUs), this model can effectively capture the long-term spatial-temporal features in air quality time-series data. In addition, we also investigated the problem of predicting PM2.5 concentrations in the areas without monitoring stations or at sites far away from the stations. This problem has not captured researchers' attention whose methods are based on GNN. The problem is, however, quite challenging as these areas do not have historical air quality data, leading to low prediction quality. Finally, we performed experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model based on actual data sources obtained in Taiwan. The results show that the proposed model exhibits satisfactory prediction performance compared to existing models.

TI Incorporating global-local neighbors with Gaussian mixture embedding for

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Knowledge representation; Knowledge graph; Link prediction; Text mining
AB Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) aims to predict the missing parts of the query triplet based on a small number of known samples. To solve the above task, many existing approaches enhance entity embedding by encoding local neighbor information and obtain few-shot relational representations by encoding support triples. Although these previous studies have achieved promising results, they still suffer from the following two challenges: (1) Remote neighbor contains rich semantic information, how to effectively encode remote neighbor information is the first challenge? (2) Low-frequency relations and complex relations in the knowledge graph lead to uncertainty in the semantics of the relation, how to effectively model the uncertainty of the few-shot relation is the second challenge? For the former issue, we propose a global-local neighbor encoding module, where global encoder captures remote neighbor features based on relation paths and local encoder uses the task-aware attention mechanism to capture local neighbor features. For the latter issue, we employee the adaptive gaussian mixture model to model few-shot relation, which can adapt to different queries by dynamically adjusting component weights. Link prediction experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets NELL-One and Wiki-One, and the proposed model achieved 14.0% and 7.8% improvement in the evaluation metric Hits@1 respectively, compared to the strong baseline model FAAN.

AB Visibility in foggy weather is of great value for traffic management and pollution monitoring. However, vision-based fog visibility estimation methods are usually based on a single image to approximate the visibility in foggy weather, and most existing data-driven machine learning models struggle to capture effective features and achieve high estimation accuracy due to the severe image degradation caused by reduced visibility and lack of real scene images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning framework based on multi visual feature fusion for fog visibility estimation, named VENet, which comprises of two subtask networks (for fog level classification and fog visibility estimation) constructed in a cascade structure. A special feature extractor and an anchor-based regression method (ARM) are proposed to help improve the accuracy. Further, a standard Fog Visibility Estimation Image (FVEI) dataset containing 15,000 images of real fog scenes is established. This dataset greatly bridges the lack of suitable data in the field of vision-based visibility estimation. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed VENet, where the error of fog visibility estimation is less than 5% at 500 m and the fog level classification accuracy is at least 92.3%. In addition, the proposed VENet has been applied on Yunnan Xiangli and Mazhao Expressway surveillance with promising performance in practice.

AB Traffic flow forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation development and an important task in realizing intelligent transportation services. This task is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies between road nodes and some other external factors. Most existing GCN-based methods usually use a single and fixed adjacency matrix to characterize the global spatiotemporal relationship of road networks, which limits the expressiveness of the model in different scenarios and ignores the dynamic nature of node relationships that change over time. In addition, sudden traffic accidents may also cause fluctuations in traffic flow in the short term, which may affect the accuracy of the model prediction. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-graph neural network (DMGNN) incorporating traffic accidents for multi-step traffic flow prediction. First, to provide richer prior knowledge for the model, we construct multiple graphs to represent various contextual dependencies among nodes. Second, we designed a dynamic graph adjustment module to update the adjacency matrix used in each training step. Finally, we build a deep learning framework based on GAT and Bi-LSTM to focus on local fluctuations caused by traffic incidents and to extract sophisticated spatiotemporal correlations between data. We conducted extensive experiments on two real traffic datasets to evaluate the model, and the ablation experiments verified the effectiveness of each module. On the standard public dataset PEMSD3, compared to the optimal baseline model, our model improves the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of the multistep prediction by about 21%, 21%, and 22%, respectively.

AB ABSTR A C T Corona virus disease which has caused frustration in the human community remains the concern of the globe as every government struggles to defeat the pandemic. In this manuscript, we have extensively studied a new deterministic SEQIHR model of deadly Corona virus pandemic governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations to provide deep insight into the dynamics of the disease. The purpose is to perform a complete mathematical analysis and the design of an optimal control strategy for the developed deterministic model by utilizing the preventive measures of quarantine and hospitalization. Some comprehensive mathematical techniques are employed to demonstrate the positivity and boundedness of solutions. Two main equilibrium points of the pandemic model are stated. To handle the future dynamical behavior of the pandemic, the thresh-old parameter value is computed using the next-generation method. The local and global asymptotic stability conditions of both the equilibria are obtained successfully. A numerical analysis to observe the effectiveness of quarantine and hospitalization strategies is performed and illustrated by graphs. We implemented the well known Non-Standard Finite Difference (NSFD) method to find the numerical solution of model. Numerical simulations are conducted to support our analytic results. The developed model is subjected to sensitivity analysis and the most sensitive parameters are identified. The bifurcation nature of the developed model is examined. An optimal control problem is introduced for the proposed model to determine the best controls for the implemented hospitalization and quarantine strategies. With the attention of reducing the number of exposed and infected persons, an optimum control problem and its derived associated optimality conditions of Pontryagin type are explored. An important feature of this study is to employ NSFD method backward in time for the first time to solve optimal control problem instead of other standard methods. The extremals are obtained numerically. Moreover, we have shown the effectiveness of optimal controls on the human community to view more features of the state variables in the proposed model.

AB Founding on the design science research methodology (DSRM), this study integrates an additive network DEA model with hierarchical process to assess the R & D organization's two-stage production process model of "R & D performance" and "economic performance" and address the differences of cross-level organizations for decision analysis. With this proposed approach, we derive the overall composition and partition efficiency of the components and discuss the relationship between system efficiency, partition efficiency and composition of Taiwanese R & D organizations. The efficiency values of the economic stage have significantly increased, while the efficiency values of the R & D performance stage see no evident changes over the sample period. Moreover, the efficiency values of the economic stage are significantly better than the those of the R & D performance stage. On average, the sample R & D organizations still have 64.7% of room for improvement. Overall, the DSRM of this study provides an innovative "artefact" and new insights on the hierarchical process and network structure of national R & D organizations to help policy makers understand the competitive advantages and improve directions of R & D organizations and make the most effective decisions.

AB Causal machine learning (ML) algorithms recover graphical structures that tell us something about cause-and effect relationships. The causal representation provided by these algorithms enables transparency and explain ability, which is necessary for decision making in critical real-world problems. Yet, causal ML has had limited impact in practice compared to associational ML. This paper investigates the challenges of causal ML with application to COVID-19 UK pandemic data. We collate data from various public sources and investigate what the various structure learning algorithms learn from these data. We explore the impact of different data formats on algorithms spanning different classes of learning, and assess the results produced by each algorithm, and groups of algorithms, in terms of graphical structure, model dimensionality, sensitivity analysis, confounding variables, predictive and interventional inference. We use these results to highlight open problems in causal structure learning and directions for future research. To facilitate future work, we make all graphs, models, data sets, and source code publicly available online.

ID GROUNDWATER LEVEL
AB The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused a lot of mortality. The high mortality rate occurred because of the physicians' wrong or late identification of COVID-19 severity. So, developing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques is critical to help physicians correctly identify the severity of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic and then decrease the COVID-19 mortality percentage. In this paper, we develop a new green CAD system using a new hybrid handcrafted feature extraction algorithm and two-stage neural network architecture to grade the COVID-19 patient based on Computed Tomography (CT) scan images as having a moderate, severe, or critical infection. Because the proposed system uses handcrafted feature extraction algorithms, it consumes minimum resources and time than recent works. The proposed system consists of three phases: lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and diagnosis. Firstly, lesions from the CT scan image are manually segmented, and then three schemes are applied to extract salient features from the segmented lesions. These schemes are the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), and a new hybrid method that consists of cascading Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Then, the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is computed for each scheme to extract the statistical markers. In the grading phase, a two-stage neural network approach is used. First, the extracted features are individually trained and tested for each scheme in the first neural network stage, and then the results of the first stage are combined to train and test each patient in the second neural network stage. The performance of the proposed system was assessed on a CT image dataset of 300 COVID-19-positive patients collected from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) website. The experimental results showed that our proposed system achieved 100% accuracy and kappa when the dataset was partitioned into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Also, it achieved 95.67% & PLUSMN; 0.47, 99.33% & PLUSMN; 0.77, and 100% & PLUSMN; 0 accuracies and 93.48% & PLUSMN; 0.74, 98.997% & PLUSMN; 1.16, and 100% & PLUSMN; 0 kappa values when the data was organized using 2, 4, and 10 folds, respectively. A green complexity algorithm analysis shows that this proposed system takes O(n) time complexity and 1 h and 20 min to train and test all cases. The performed green complexity analysis shows that the proposed system consumes 117.80 g Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e), 130.80 Wh, and 0.13 tree months for the carbon footprint, the energy needed, and the carbon sequestration, respectively. These results show that the proposed work consumes fewer resources and provides a green CAD system.

TI Hypergraph-based attribute reduction of formal contexts in rough sets
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Attribute reduction; Hypergraph; Formal context; Rough set
ID KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS
AB The process of attribute reduction is a critical aspect of rough set theory as applied to data analysis. Several methods for attribute reduction have been outlined in previous studies. For instance, hypergraph theory has shed light on this area. However, most existing methods of attribute reduction focus on theories, leading to complexities when searching for attribute reducts due to an absence of visuality. Moreover, although certain existing methods of attribute reduction are used by certain visual methods, such as that of combining hypergraphs, none of them acknowledge the uniqueness of the relationship between hypergraphs and the corresponding information systems. This flaw results in accurate results for a specific information system under consideration in a particular paper, but unreliable results for another system. Consequently, it impedes the promotion of attribute reduction in rough set theory. Thus, investigating a visual method free of this limitation, to accomplish attribute reduction, emerges as a task that requires immediate resolution in rough set theory. This paper addresses this problem for a conventional information system (formal context). First, this paper illustrates the process of constructing a hypergraph from a formal context and vice versa. The two constructions are verified to be unique under isomorphisms. We found that our method exhibits superior time complexity compared to certain methods that constructed basic graphs from certain information systems. Second, under the Pawlak umbrella of classical rough set model for a formal context, this study constructs a family P of equivalence relations on the set of objects. With the aid of a diagram of the relevant hypergraph within the formal context, it presents a method for determining the dispensability of each element in P. Third, guided by the relevant hypergraph of the formal context, an approach for investigating reducts of P and the attribute set is proposed. Compared with certain methods of attribute reduction in rough sets using hypergraphs, the approach proposed in this paper is superior in certain aspects. Finally, the obtained results are verified and demonstrate practical applications through an example of biological classification. The use of hypergraph diagrams in the proposed methodology enhances its visibility, therefore contributing to the enrichment of attribute reduction in rough set theory. This is beneficial for the promotion and application of the resulting achievements.

ID SIDE INFORMATION
AB Recommender Systems are helpful to many by filtering the information according to an individual's preferences. However, the choice of a person may change with time. Keeping track of these changes or predicting the next sequence of items is difficult for any recommender system. Most time-aware recommender systems exploit users' rating distribution to predict the next possible set of items. But due to the sparsity (users' preferences) in real-world datasets, these models suffer from low accuracy. To overcome such issues, this study proposes a collaborative filtering model which uses a preference estimation technique that uses user and item feature information along with the ratings. Further, we have used preference relations (instead of ratings) to improve the ranking quality of the recommender system. We have used the ML-1M, NetFlix, and Last.fm datasets for evaluation, the benchmark datasets for recommender systems testing. All these three datasets have sparsity levels above 92%. Experimental results indicate significant improvement (5 to 7%) over the state-of-the-art related baselines.

AB In measuring road safety, accident severity is a key concern. Crash severity prediction models inform researchers about the severity of a crash based on a variety of criteria. To date, an enormous amount of research has been done on crash severity, and several models have been suggested to forecast crash severity utilizing existing test data or simulated datasets created using regression or classification analysis. In this study, a new approach was developed to determine the level of road crash severity (LRCS) using a large amount of real-existing data (1627 cases) by applying machine learning methods to the roads of Calabria in southern Italy. This study has three main goals: building prediction models based on classification approaches with the highest accuracy; comparing the performance of two supervised learning methods, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), for predicting the LRCS; as well as determining the role of each of the contributing parameters in the LRCS and presenting a ranking by performing a sensitivity analysis. Finally, based on the accuracy values, it has been found that there isn't a salient difference between the predicted models. But it should be noted that 68.4% accuracy for the testing dataset implies the CNN model was superior to the ANN model, which scored 61.74% accuracy. This is acceptable if the minor variation in modeling accuracy is desired. Also, the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the number of vehicles and the road element had the highest and lowest effect rates on the LRCS, respectively.

AB In the study and research of medical images, the sharp and smooth pancreatic segmentation challenge is a critical and challenging one. The most widely utilized and effective technique for pancreatic segmentation with smooth and precise results is a proposed LMNS-net deep learning, bottom-up approach. The proposed LMNS-net is used to automatically segment the pancreas in clinical abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. For the segmentation of the acute pancreas using several angles of CT scans, such as coronal, axial, and sagittal, a proposed LMNS-net model is used. In the LMNS-Net model, 12 layers are used with 4 convolution layers. LMNS-Net model is used for many organ segmentation from CT scans clinical images with high accuracy. The lightweight multiscale block is used in the proposed approach which is aggregating the required feature only so unused information dropout at the convolution layer. The computation time-period is reduced as related to the state-of-art. Validation is 99.78% and loss values vary from 1 to 0 only. The LMNS-Net model achieved a dice similarity index score up to 88.68 & PLUSMN;57.49%. The LMNS-Net model takes 1 to 3 s for the segmentation of medical CT images in the testing process. The LMNS-Net model takes very less time for testing purposes as compared to other approaches. Top-down approaches are not useful in the detection of pancreatic cancer images from CT scan images. In Bottom-Up approaches, the LMNS-Net is useful to detect accurate sharpness of the pancreas and kidney, the pancreatic cancer-affected area within less time only. In medical image segmentation, the time of training deep learning approach is a key constraint. "VGG-16"and "VGG-19"are taking too much time, so more time is required for disease diagnosis. The training time of the LMNS-Net model is reduced as compared to the State-of-Arts.

AB While research in the area of imbalance, which is understood as classes that are not equally represented, is mainly addressed in classification, it has hardly been studied in regression, where data maldistribution, or imbalance, can be defined as the existence of some specific subdomains of the output variable misrepresented in the training data set, resulting in low accuracy for new instances within these subdomains. The small amount of state-of-the-art techniques are "passive", meaning they are only applied in preprocessing. In this contribution, we propose two new specific evolutionary algorithms based on fuzzy rules to "actively"address imbalanced regression problems and improve the overall performance of the algorithms instead of just addressing the imbalance problem. The results obtained after applying statistical tests to 32 regression datasets that handle more than 3000 partitions show the effectiveness of the proposed methods when compared to the best previous proposal, a passive method called SMOGN. We can conclude: (1) we cannot affirm, since the equality hypotheses have not been rejected, that there are significant performance differences between using stratified and non-stratified data, thus we will use stratification to preserve a minimum representation of the minority set, (2) both fuzzy rule-based methods obtain better results in terms of the imbalance metric when using SMOGN, but in both methods this incurs a cost in accuracy (with confidence scores of over 99.0%), and (3) the proposed methods outperform those using SMOGN as they get slightly better results in the imbalance metric, with better average ranks in both proposals, and obtain significantly better results in global accuracy, that is, all the performance metrics studied improve statistically with a confidence score of over 99.0%, with the exception of one metric, which scores above 90.0%.

AB This research introduces a new variant of two-echelon vehicle routing problems inspired from the city logistics. The problem considers a two-echelon freight distribution network where customers are located at the second echelon while their goods are transported from the source in the first echelon to intermediate facilities, i.e., satellites, parcel lockers, and transshipment nodes. Customers can receive their goods that can be delivered by either city freighters or occasional drivers at their homes or are assigned to perform self-pickup at selected parcel lockers. The objective is to minimize total operational cost. We name the problem the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, Intermediate Facilities, and Occasional Drivers (2E-VRPTW-IF-OD) and cast the problem as a mixed integer linear programming model and devise a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (HALNS) using, amongst others, set-partitioning like neighborhoods to provide solutions for newly generated 2E-VRPTW-IF-OD instances. Extensive experiments show high-quality performance of HALNS for solving two special cases of 2E-VRPTW-IF-OD. We further improve 24 best-known solutions for one of the special cases. Finally, we also derive various interesting managerial insights.

AB As a hub connecting power production and consumption, the urban power grid (UPG) is the basis for realizing the carbon-neutral goal. To ensure carbon-neutral progress, it is necessary to conduct an effective analysis of carbon-neutral potential from the UPG perspective. Given this, this paper proposes a multi-stage decision model that integrates Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) methods under the rough-fuzzy (RF) environment. Firstly, a multi-dimensional attribute system is innovatively established, and then the rough-fuzzy number is presented to assemble assessment information of groups and to manipulate internal and external uncertainties during decision process. Subsequently, the RF-DEMATEL is utilized to determine the importance-weights of the attributes, in which the interrelationships between attributes are fully considered. Finally, the RF-MARCOS is developed and applied to obtain carbon-neutral potential analysis results based on utility functions in relation to the ideal and anti-ideal solutions. A case study is conducted based on the proposed methodology, and the stability and robustness of the results are verified through sensitive and comparative analysis. This research contributes theoretically and practically to related literature by providing a systematic model capable of handling decision problems with complexity and uncertainty.

AB The lack of effective defense resource allocation strategies and reliable multi-agent collaboration mechanisms lead to the low stability of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based security defense strategies in several Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To address the aforementioned issues and approach real-world scenarios, we construct a grid-based adversarial security scenario, propose a two-stage zero-sum security game model (including the resource allocation stage and the patrolling detection stage), and design a two-stage security game solution algorithm based on DRL for this game model, named TSGS. In the resource allocation stage, TSGS uses auxiliary action embedding and gradient approximation approach to compute the Nash Equilibrium (NE) allocation strategy, which addresses the problem of unreasonable allocation. In the patrolling detection stage, TSGS achieves team collaboration by training a multi-agent Dueling Deep-Q Network under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, which solves the cooperation problem among multiple defense agents. In addition, we design and implement a multi-parameterized attacker model to make the attacker's behaviors more realistic in the game. Finally, the validity of the TSGS is verified by detailed experimental results for several adversarial experimental scenarios. Compared with the baseline methods, the defense strategy learned by TSGS has higher utility and greater robustness. Especially, TSGS achieves efficient collaboration during the patrolling detection stage after resource allocation by making full use of real-time information and communication.

ID REASONABLE PROPERTIES
AB In this paper, we propose a novel method for ranking fuzzy numbers based on additively consistent fuzzy preference relations (ACFPR). We introduce the so-called additive priority degree (APD) to capture pair-wise comparisons of fuzzy numbers. This measure is both separable by taking a suitable parameter in the weight function and able to induce an ACFPR. Then, a ranking procedure is developed to compare the given fuzzy numbers with a total order. The proposed method combines all the point-wise comparisons among different fuzzy numbers with a strictly increasing weight function, and hence not only the shape characteristics and relative positions of fuzzy numbers, but also their importance is involved. Numerical examples show the differences of the proposed method compared to the previous approaches.

ID BEARING; CLASSIFICATION
AB To improve the fault diagnosis performance of rotating machinery under harsh conditions, a weighted average selective ensemble strategy of deep convolutional models based on the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is proposed. Firstly, two datasets in the time domain, two in the frequency domain, and one in the time-frequency domain are respectively constructed to guarantee the diversity and comprehensiveness of input expression. Secondly, two deeper Resnet18 models, which are sensitive to the comprehensive and abstract features, and two relatively shallow CNN models, which focus on the details more, are built. Thus, the fault differential features are diverse. Moreover, the improved convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is used to enhance the diagnosis performance. Then, a total of ten individual models are trained. Thirdly, F1 Score is used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each individual model on different faults, and the fault class-specific thresholds are set. For each fault, individual models with F1 Score lower than the corresponding thresholds are regarded as negative and need to be discarded. Especially, the fault class-specific thresholds are optimized by GWO. Finally, the weighted average selectively ensemble strategy is implemented based on the threshold-treated weights. Experiment results indicate that the proposed ensemble model significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy and stability of the individual models, which is also verified by other compared ensemble strategies and ensemble models.

ID PATHOLOGICAL COMPLETE RESPONSE
AB For patients diagnosed with breast cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, predicting the response of the tumor to treatment is critical, as it enables the initiation of new therapies and improves patient care. In this context, dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is the most common imaging modality for assessing tumor response during breast cancer treatment. However, the visual inspection of a patient's tumor from DCE-MRI images by a specialist is a complex and repetitive task, due to the need to analyze high numbers of images, which makes the process exhausting and prone to error. Thus, this work presents a new methodology for predicting the response of a breast tumor to treatment, using four main steps: (i) segmentation of the tumor from DCE-MRI images of the breast; (ii) generation of tumor habitats from segmented DCE-MRI images; (iii) classification of the malignancy of tumor habitats; and (iv) prediction of the response of the breast tumor to treatment, based on the tumor habitats generated. The proposed methodology was tested on the public QIN Breast DCE-MRI dataset, and achieved a Dice score of 92.89% for tumor segmentation, an accuracy of 100% for the classification of malignancy, and an accuracy of 100% in terms of predicting the response of the tumor to the treatment applied. The results presented here demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, which can be integrated into a support system for treating patients with breast cancer.

AB As the new generation of breast cancer screening tools, automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) has some difficulties of the long interpretation time in clinical application. A computer-aided diagnosis algorithm can assist diagnosticians in locating and classifying benign and malignant tumors in ABUS images quickly. However, locating and classifying ABUS images is challenging because they have inapparent and small lesion regions and blurry discriminative regions. This paper proposes the multi-view stereoscopic attention network (MVSA-Net) to address the challenges. First, MVSA-Net crops the three-dimensional (3D) lesion regions through the 3D localization unit. Second, MVSA-Net classifies the cropped lesion regions through the classification unit. The localization unit can pay more attention to lesion regions by constructing the stereoscopic attention module. Besides, the localization unit constructs the 3D localization tensor through the split output design. The classification unit can extract the stereoscopic features through the stereoscopic view and the plane features through the plane view based on the Transformer network. It also fuses the two features through the level connection design. Besides, it can more focus on the borderline region of the tumor based on the region-prior module. The paper uses 172 ABUS images to train MVSA-Net, and 42 ABUS images to test MVSA-Net. On the test set, the accuracy and AUC of MVSA-Net are 95.24% and 99.76%, respectively. MVSA-Net can assist diagnosticians in decreasing the interpretation time of ABUS images, thus helping more people screen breast tumors earlier.

AB This study proposes a novel approach for modeling financial time series, concentrating on data pre-processing and selecting effective features in conventional and proposed modeling processes. In this context, three selected machine learning methods (including RF, XGBoost, and LSTM) are utilized on the return series of a selected cryptocurrency (bitcoin). The sample data was covered from 16 August 2018 to 22 June 2022. More-over, three approaches (conventional, intermediate, and proposed) have been considered, each representing a different modeling process. The intermediate approach is a modeling process that only reflects the effect of the specific cross-validation method with purging and embargo operation in the output results (with the same selected features as the conventional process). Comparing the results of proposed and intermediate processes showed the effect of Purging and Embargo operations on decreasing the generalization error, and based on all evaluation metrics, the proposed approach has performed better than other modeling processes. The findings of this study have significant implications for investors, academic researchers, and policymakers.

AB Smell and taste disorders have become a more prominent issue due to their association with Covid-19, and their impact on quality of life and health outcomes. However, pertinent information regarding these disorders is often inaccessible and poorly organized, with the majority of data stored solely in clinical data repositories. To rectify this, a technological solution capable of digitizing, semantically modeling, and integrating health data is necessary. The knowledge graph, an emerging technology capable of organizing inconsistent and heterogeneous health data and inferring implicit knowledge, presents a viable solution to this problem. In pursuit of the aforementioned goal, an existing ontology pertaining to smell and taste disorders was enriched by introducing additional relevant concepts and relationships. Subsequently, a knowledge graph was constructed based on the defined ontology and patients' data. The resultant knowledge graph was subjected to a rigorous evaluation, encompassing dimensions such as completeness, coherency, coverage, and succinctness. The evaluation established the effectiveness and usability of the knowledge graph, with only minor issues detected through the OOPS! pitfall scanner. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept for clinical application, a user interface was created, enabling users to access pertinent information concerning smell and taste disorders, including causative factors, medications, and etiology, among others. The interface generates a graph-based structure based on the selected question from a drop-down menu. The end-user can modify the query by merely clicking on the generated graph to ask related questions. This study showcases the potential of knowledge graphs centered on smell and taste disorders to organize and provide accessible health data to end-users.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Combined query image retrieval; Vision transformer; Mix-transformer
AB Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is commonly used to extract reference image features in combined query image retrieval algorithms. CNN extracts image features by calculating the relationship between pixels in a small area through convolution kernel, which covers only a small part of the image each time. Therefore, CNN pays more attention to the local information of the image, which is easy to cause the loss of global information of the image. In order to enrich the feature information of reference images and improve the retrieval performance of network model, this paper proposes the following improvements: (1) Multi-Headed Self-Attention (MSA) in Vision Transformer (ViT) only pays attention to the correlation within samples, ignoring the correlation between samples, this makes it is difficult to obtain a global condition of the dataset, which limits the ability of ViT to capture reference image information. To solve this problem, we propose Group External Attention (GEA) module and replace MSA in ViT with it, thus proposing Mix-Transformer. Further, we build a hybrid network of CNN and Mix-Transformer to capture the reference image features. (2) We introduce Shuffle Attention (SA) module to reaggregate reference image features extracted by CNN in groups by channel, so that information can flow between different groups, which can effectively enhance the richness and relevance of reference image feature information. A large number of experiments have been conducted on Fashion200k and MIT-States publicly available datasets, and experimental results confirm our algorithm's outstanding performance.

DE Citrus pests and diseases; Named entity recognition; BERT; BiLSTM; CRF
AB In the agricultural industry, there is still a need for improved systematic integration of knowledge related to citrus pests and diseases. Creating a knowledge base focused on citrus pests and diseases and developing a knowledge map would enable the formation of a system providing accurate and convenient prevention and control methods for citrus growers. However, the majority of existing data on citrus pests and diseases is un-structured, making identifying named entities from large volumes of unstructured text data particularly important for creating a knowledge map. In this paper, we propose a training model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), combined with Bidirectional Long and Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF), to extract specific entity categories from unstructured data. When tested on a created dataset, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 0.9423 and an f1 value of 0.8048. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to extract specific entity categories from text data related to citrus pests and diseases, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a knowledge map. This paper introduces a method for named entity recognition in the field of citrus pests and diseases, which could serve as a reference for constructing knowledge maps in other fields and improving the utilization of domain knowledge.

DE Driver distraction detection; Convolutional neural network; Transformer;
   Hyperparameter optimization; Multimodal
AB Distracted driving has become one of the main contributors to traffic accidents. It is therefore of great interest for intelligent vehicles to establish a distraction detection system that can continuously monitor driver behavior and respond accordingly. Although significant progress has been made in the existing research, most of them focus on extracting either local features or global features while ignoring the other one. To make full use of both local features and global features, we integrate multi-source perception information and propose a novel dual-channel feature extraction model based on CNN and Transformer. In order to improve the model's fitting ability to time series data, the CNN channel and Transformer channel are modeled separately using the mid-point residual structure. The scaling factors in the residual structure are regarded as hyperparameters, and a penalized validation method based on bilevel optimization is introduced to obtain the optimal values automatically. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on a multimodal dataset of driver distraction validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper investigates a hybrid emergency decision-making (EDM) method called TrF-BWM-ZSG by combining the BWM (best-worst method) and ZSG (zero-sum game) in trapezoidal fuzzy (TrF) environment. Firstly, this paper defines the entropy and similarity for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs). Based on the entropy and similarity measures, a bi-objective programming model is constructed to distribute the weights for experts. Then, based on the multiplicative consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reference comparisons (TrFRCs), a novel TrFBWM is investigated to yield the TrF criteria weights. This novel TrFBWM highlights two innovations: (i) A crisp goal programming weight-determining model is constructed by using the multiplicative consistent TrFRCs; (ii) A reasonable consistency ratio is defined, in which the consistency index is determined according to the consistent transitivity of TrFRCs. Afterwards, the TrFZSG is developed to achieve the alternatives' ranking order by extending the classical ZSG into TrF environment. Lastly, the availability of the TrF-BWM-ZSG is corroborated through a real EDM case of Henan rainstorm disaster. The advantages of the TrF-BWM-ZSG are manifested by several valuable comparisons. Some desirable results derived by the TrF-BWM-ZSG are received: (i) The optimal alternative selected by the proposed TrF-BWM-ZSG suits the actual rescue situation; (ii) The proposed TrF-BWMZSG owns high generality since TrFN can reduce to crisp number, interval and triangular fuzzy number; (iii) The developed novel TrFBWM is helpful to preserve more inherent information of TrFNs.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Parameter reduction is a crucial procedure for enhancing the effectiveness of decision-making processes in the theory of interval-valued fuzzy soft set, which is a developing and excellent mathematical tool for processing blurry data. However, there exist severe gaps in the existing literatures. That is, the existing parameter reduction algorithms for interval-valued fuzzy soft sets have high computational complexity and low success rate of finding reduction. By considering these gaps, this study firstly develops the notions of the mean degree of membership and Euclidean distance between parameters. And then a new Euclidean Distance-based parameter reduction algorithm for interval-valued fuzzy soft set is proposed. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with the existing parameter reduction algorithms in terms of computational complexity and success rate of finding reduction on 35 randomly generated data sets and a real-life application of Five-Star Hotels evaluation. Through the comparison results, it is clear that our approach has the lower computational complexity and higher success rate of finding reduction. Consequently, our method which is substantiated on the validity and superiority is a good solution for parameter reduction of interval-valued fuzzy soft sets.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; ALGORITHM; SCHEME
AB In recent times, many modern businesses have been adopting cloud computing platforms to deploy their workflow applications. However, scheduling workflows and allocating resources is a difficult task due to factors such as task dependency, heterogeneity, and computational intensity. Resource allocation can pose significant challenges in terms of execution time and cost. As a result, there is a need to reduce energy consumption, makespan, and cost simultaneously, which is often framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient RL-based workflow scheduling framework for cloud computing. The framework integrates the X-NOR Whirlpool hashing algorithm to enhance security by allowing legitimate users into the cloud environment. The Linearly Weighted Moving Average Sea Lion Optimization method is used to compute minimal parameters, the Jordan Normal Form Deep Kronecker Neural Network is utilized for resource monitoring, and the Fuzzy Self-Defense algorithm is employed for efficient selection of virtual machines. We considered the Heterogeneous Computing Scheduling Problem (HCSP) and the Grid Workload Archive (GWA) T-12 Bitbrains datasets to compare our proposed framework with existing works. Based on the result analysis, the proposed LJC Framework outperforms the QoS-HEFT, TCCS, and SHEFTEX algorithms, achieving better performance.

AB Combustible gas is widely used in industry and daily life but presents an unavoidable explosion hazard. Predicting explosion overpressure and guiding engineering design is an effective way to reduce the consequences of explosions. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates explosive theory and data science. Starting from the first principle, a dimensionless mathematical formula was constructed based on the explosive theory. Gas species, gas concentration, container parameters, and ignition position were fully considered by the formula, and built into data sets using machine learning techniques as characteristic parameters. The SVR algorithm, the BP algorithm, and the DNN algorithm all attest to the superiority. And the predictive physical consistency of this method has been proven. Simultaneously, the dataset constructed by this method effectively reduces the number of features. The PSO algorithm was used for parameter optimization based on the DNN algorithm guided by theory for building F-P (First principle) PSO-DNN Model. In the comparison of prediction results, the mean relative error of the F-P PSO-DNN model is 15%, 19% lower than that of the best performing Molkov model.

AB Oversampling method is used to solve the class imbalanced issues. Some existing oversampling methods do not well remove noisy samples and avoid synthesizing noisy samples. Therefore, we propose a new oversampling approach based differential evolution on the safe set for highly imbalanced datasets (SS_DEBOHID). SS_DEBOHID firstly uses k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method to learn the safe area of minority; then the DEBOHID oversampling method is used to synthesize new minority samples in the safe area. The advantages of SS_DEBOHID include that (a) it generates samples in the safe area to reduce generation of noisy samples and reduce synthetic samples falling into the classification boundary and majority area; (b) it uses the DEBOHID method to synthesize samples and increase the diversity of samples; (c) the method is suitable for highly imbalanced datasets. The proposed method is compared with 10 methods on 43 highly imbalanced datasets and evaluated on AUC and G_Mean metrics. The experimental results show that SS_DEBOHID obtains more than 30 best performing datasets on KNN, SVM, and DT classifiers in terms of AUC and G_mean, respectively. The proposed method outperforms other methods by 8.07% to 24.34% on average AUC metric and by at least 6.96% and up to 45.37% on average G_mean metric. In addition, we validate the efficiency of SS_DEBOHID on 8 high-dimensional and large sample size datasets. The experimental results show that SS_DEBOHID has better classification performance and robustness.

ID GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB More recently, vision transformer (ViT) has shown competitive performance with convolutional neural network (CNN) on computer vision tasks, which provided more possibilities for accurate classification of hyperspectral image (HSI). However, whether CNN or ViT, they generally only focus on single type of feature, resulting in insufficient information utilization. For instance, CNN has powerful local feature extraction ability, while ViT pays more attention to long-range dependencies and global features. To consider multiple types of feature information, we propose a multiple vision architectures-based hybrid network (MVAHN) for HSI classification, which consists of joint CNN and transformer (JCT) structure and graph convolutional module (GCM). Firstly, JCT successfully embeds convolution operations into ViT to capture local and global features, which mainly include: 1) A spectral spatial convolution block (SSCB) is proposed to unearth local spectral spatial features. 2) A convolution embedding is aggregated into self-attention to design a local-global attention (LGA) mechanism, which can realize the seamless integration of CNN and ViT, thereby capturing local-global combined features. Secondly, a plug-and-play GCM is developed in parallel with transformer encoders to further improve the model classification ability by mining the similarity relationship between pixels in HSI. Overall, an elegant integration of these seemingly distinct paradigms is realized by MVAHN to capture multiple types of feature information. The overall accuracies (OAs) of MVAHN on Pavia University, Houston 2013, Salinas Valley, Kennedy Space Center, Indian Pines and Botswana datasets are 96.37%, 88.33%, 97.57%, 98.96%, 96.25% and 99.26%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art hybrid models, MVAHN achieves competitive classification results. The source code will be available at https://github.com/ZJier/MVAHN.

DE Link prediction; Graph embedding; Isolated node; Random negative

AB With the increase of graph-structure data, link prediction has become an active research topic. Recent progress in link prediction involves learning graph embeddings through graph neural networks. Graph autoencoders(GAE), variational graph autoencoders(VGAE), and their variants such as graph normalized autoencoders(GNAE) try to learn graph embeddings in an unsupervised setting and show promising results in link prediction. However, they suffer from degraded performance with two issues; they tend to assign close to-zero embedding on nodes with zero degree (i.e., isolated node problem) and the issue caused by random negative sampling has not been addressed in link prediction experiments. As the two issues affect only links and not feature information, we propose a generic learning method based on the property of feature information that alleviates both issues and outperforms strong baselines across benchmark datasets.

AB In this paper, we present a novel approach called F-CAPSO (Fuzzy Chaos Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization) to enhance energy efficiency and security of data transmission in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). MANETs are wireless networks comprising mobile nodes that encounter challenges such as limited battery power and mobility.Our approach incorporates routing and clustering processes in MANETs and leverages the Fuzzy-based CAPSO algorithm for selecting the optimal Cluster Head (CH). Additionally, we integrate Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) with Replacement Method and Sine Cosine algorithm (SCA) search (SSARM-SCA) algorithm to achieve optimal routing and secure data transmission. A trust-based encryption strategy is employed to establish a secure route.We evaluate the proposed approach using performance metrics such as throughput, network lifetime, endto-end delay, packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, and routing overhead ratio. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms four state-of-the-art techniques (MARP-HO, ACO-HSA, GAHC, and HFAPSO) in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime, with improvements observed for up to 3500 rounds.Our proposed approach offers a comprehensive solution to address the challenges of energy efficiency and security in MANETs, making it beneficial for applications such as tracking and military environments. By integrating the Fuzzy-based CAPSO algorithm and the SSARM-SCA routing protocol, we optimize CH selection and routing paths, respectively, leading to better network performance and an extended network lifetime.

AB The imbalanced dataset in actual engineering negatively affects the precision of fault diagnosis because of the severe lack of collected fault data. To effectively address this issue, an adaptive feature fusion assisted generation adversarial network is proposed, which can use very restricted numbers of samples for data augmentation. Firstly, the U-Net network is introduced into the generate adversarial network, which can ensure the spatial characteristics of samples and accurately extract characteristics from extremely finite samples. Secondly, to avoid the problem of reducing the diversity of generated samples due to single signal input, a module for adaptive feature fusion is constructed to guide the generator to learn and effectively improve the diversity of generated samples. Finally, construct a new loss function by utilizing a dual discriminator network to keep the training process running smoothly. To validate the proposed method, experiments are conducted on the datasets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and a self-built test bench. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method can generate high-quality samples using very restricted samples, outperforming the comparison methods in terms of structural similarity (SSIM), maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Fre & PRIME;chet inception distance (FID) metrics. This shows the advantages of the proposed generation model in terms of sample diversity and similarity and can be used to greatly boost fault identification precision.

AB According to research, the Supply Chain Management (SCM) accounts for most of a company's environmental effects. When goods are manufactured and transported worldwide, supply chains frequently include energyintensive manufacturing and transportation. As a result, sustainability is crucial throughout the supply chain. Putting economic operations in line with environmental preservation and social welfare standards has become important globally. In order to improve the overall performance of the supply chain, the industries are thus looking into their SCM structures in collaboration with a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider. Consequently, for a broader view of increased company value, choosing the correct 3PL supplier for a lasting partnership is of the utmost importance. The fundamental motive of this research is to pick the most suitable 3PL provider for a food manufacturing company (FMC) following a comprehensive review of six distinct viable logistic providers working in India for over a decade. Choosing the best 3PL provider is incredibly difficult and demanding due to the inherent uncertainty related to subjectivity and the qualitative review of the performances of service provider. In this article, we propose a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) that combines the LOgarithmic Percentage Changedriven Objective Weighting (LOPCOW), Full Consistency Method (FUCOM), and DOmbi Bonferroni (DOBI) methods for evaluating criteria and ranking alternatives. The proposed method is tested and verified on a case study of an Indian FMC's optimal selection of 3PL providers. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis findings, it was established that the presented TFN-based LOPCOW-FUCOM-DOBI model delivers stable or consistent solutions. It is demonstrated in this work that the novel hybrid MCDM approach is an effective and trustworthy technique for rational decision-making.

TI EMPPNet: Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Cross-modal

AB Obtaining comprehensive and informative representations of molecules is a crucial prerequisite for efficient molecule property prediction in artificial intelligence-driven drug design and discovery. While recent advance-ments in graph neural networks (GNNs) and sequence modeling have achieved satisfactory results in molecular research, integrating molecular representations of different modalities effectively still faces significant chal-lenges. Existing ensemble methods often rely on a simple concatenation of features and the valuable domain information may be overlooked. Therefore, we propose the novel EMPPNet (Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Cross-modal Information Flow and Hierarchical Attention) method that leverages cross-modal information flow to capture the varied granularities of molecular characterization. The model incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to enable fully interactive multi-modal information encodings. Moreover, molecular reconstruction is used as a self-supervised task to enhance molecular representation. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the EMPPNet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, including classification and regression tasks. Our model also highlights the significance of leveraging molecular information from different modalities, each of which contributes unique and diverse information essential for precise property prediction.

AB As computer networks and interconnected systems continue to gain widespread adoption, ensuring cybersecu-rity has become a prominent concern for organizations, regardless of their scale or size. Meanwhile, centralized machine learning-based Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have shown promising results in improving the accuracy and efficiency of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). However, new challenges arise such as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions that must be tackled. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution that allows distributed clients to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving the privacy of their local data. In this paper, we propose Fed-ANIDS, a NIDS that leverages AD and FL to address the privacy concerns associated with centralized models. To detect intrusions, we compute an intrusion score based on the reconstruction error of normal traffic using various AD models, including simple autoencoders, variational autoencoders, and adversarial autoencoders. We thoroughly evaluate Fed-ANIDS using various settings and popular datasets, including USTC-TFC2016, CIC-IDS2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving high performance in terms of different metrics while preserving the data privacy of distributed clients. Our findings highlight that autoencoder-based models outperform other generative adversarial network-based models, achieving high detection accuracy coupled with fewer false alarms. In addition, the FL framework (FedProx), which is a generalization and re-parametrization of the standard method for FL (FedAvg), achieves better results. The code is available at

AB Falls are a major cause of unintended injuries and death worldwide. Fall detection has received considerable attention in wrist-wearable devices such as smartwatches and bands. In the case of network congestion, such as during a disaster, the available transmission bandwidth may become limited. The device must send minimal data to the server to detect falls. We proposed a high-accuracy fall detection method using limited data by analyzing three open datasets acquired from a wrist sensor using artificial intelligence. The proposed model achieved a higher fall prediction accuracy than those of previous studies with each dataset. Moreover, by adopting an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm, the amount of data was reduced fourfold; however, the performance remained unchanged at & PLUSMN;1%. To verify the robustness of the model, they were validated against each other and within each dataset, and fifteen features were selected for fall detection. The proposed model obtained a high fall detection accuracy with less data than those used in previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of wrist wearable devices.

AB Nowadays industrial robots have become the key equipment in the context of smart manufacturing and the assembly process is seen as one of the dominant fields of robotic applications. However, robotic assembly still greatly relies on manual programming and performs in a highly controlled and structured environment in a repetitive manner with weak generalization. Recent successes in robot learning show that endowing robot intelligence to obtain skills autonomously is a promising approach. The existing robot learning methods are difficult to apply due to the requirement of sufficient trial-and-error exploration which is hardware-cost and time-consuming. When encountering an unfamiliar task, it is natural for human to use their prior knowledge as guidance to derive the explorative action and then leaning the related skills from the accumulated experience. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided robot learning method with predictive model to improve the safety and efficiency of assembly skills acquisition. Concretely, based on Cartesian compliance control, a knowledge-guided exploration strategy (KGES) using the fuzzy logic about position/force feedback is built to provide direction and limit the range of exploration in the early learning stages. Upon KGES, a predictive model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed to optimize the local searching trajectory, where the training data, generated from the trained ensemble predictive models with a knowledge-guided branched progressive rollout method, is used for policy optimization. Finally, the proposed method is tested in two peg-in-hole assembly tasks in MuJoCo environment, and the results show that the robot can learn the assembly skill faster and perform better in success rate than model-free and knowledge-free settings while maintaining the contact force within a safe range.

AB This paper aims to address the challenges posed by complex scenery image classification. Most of the existing deep learning networks are trained and evaluated using ImageNet. However, when these models are applied to scenery images, dramatic performance degradation is observed due to the change in data characteristics. To challenge the prevailing practices in network design, we investigate the impact of altering data on the performance of deep networks. Specifically, we introduce a novel data-oriented network design to emphasize the importance of considering the unique characteristics of the data. Our proposed approach is a Deep-Narrow Network, which incorporates a Dilated Pooling module built upon the ResNet architecture. Compared to ResNet, our approach achieves a significant reduction of floating-point operations by 51.5% and in the number of parameters by 54.5%. Remarkably, despite the reduction in computational complexity and model size, our design exhibits a 0.4% increase in overall accuracy. This approach offers an efficient and effective means of scaling the network according to the data characteristics while maintaining highly competitive performance.

DE Remote sensing image; Instance segmentation; Region-based; Long-range

AB The goal of remote sensing image (RSI) instance segmentation is to perform instance-level semantic parsing of its contents. Aside from classifying and locating regions of interest (RoI), it also requires assigning finer pixel -wise annotations to objects. However, RSI often suffers from cluttered backgrounds, variable object scales, and complex object edge contours, making the instance segmentation task more challenging. In this work, we analytically customize an instance segmentation model that is more suitable for RSI. Specifically, we propose three novel modules for a region-based instance segmentation framework, namely Channel-Spatial Attention Module (CSA), Multi-Scale Aware Module (MSA), and Semantic Relation Learning Module (SRL). Among them, feature calibration performed by CSA can alleviate the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in both channel and spatial dimensions. Inheriting the capabilities of both the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Transformer, SRL can help the network integrate both neighborhood features and long-range dependencies for instance semantic prediction. The MSA module designs a cascaded residual structure with different receptive fields to model the scale variation of objects in RSI. Experimental results on challenging ISAID, NWPU VHR-10, SSDD, BITTC and HRSID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving mask APs of 40.2%, 68.2%, 68.4%, 50.4% and 55.8% respectively.

AB In practical scenarios, it is difficult to acquire fault data from rotating machinery, resulting in class-imbalanced problems in the fault diagnosis field. Training a fault diagnosis model directly on an imbalanced dataset may lead to overfitting for minority classes and skewness toward majority classes. Thus, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on contrastive augmented deep reinforcement learning (CADRL) with two-stage training. In the pretraining stage, we obtain sample pairs based on the batch construction strategy to calculate the contrastive loss. Then, this loss is used to train a feature extraction model to reduce intraclass distances and increase interclass distances. During the fine-tuning stage, an adaptive reward function that updates with the sample label distribution is adopted in the fault diagnosis model. This function can balance the attention given by the model to different fault modes and improve fault diagnosis performance on imbalanced data without prior knowledge. Case studies conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that the pretraining stage can provide a well-trained feature extraction model, which can be merged into the proposed fault diagnosis model to achieve better fault diagnosis performance than that of other advanced models.

AB The continuous malicious software (malware) attacks on smartphones pose a serious threat to the security of users, especially the dominant platform Android. Data-driven methods based on machine learning algorithms are a promising way to defend against that. In this paper, we explore the limitations of this kind of methods in improving the performance of malware detection, e.g., considering each feature in isolation and relying on balanced class data, and propose a multi-model ensemble framework MEFDroid by combining individual predictors, where hybrid deep learning based feature extraction methods are adopted to learn meaningful features from raw data. Besides, a novel fusion scheme is exploited to fuse multi-level representations and mine their correlations to maximize the utilization of original information. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MEFDroid framework, we conduct a step-by-step model justification experiment to investigate how the proposed algorithms (i.e., ESAES, EDAES and EDAFS) enhance the malware detection performance gradually. We also compare the proposed algorithms with classical machine learning methods, conventional sampling solutions for the imbalance problem. Besides, we investigate the reliability of our proposed methods using another public dataset. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the target model EDAFS in MEFDroid outperforms others in terms of most metrics, which means that it is an effective alternative solution to detect Android malware.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Recent deep learning-based object detectors have shown compelling performance for the detection of large objects in autonomous driving applications. However, the detection of small objects like traffic signs and traffic lights is challenging owing to the complex nature of such objects. This article investigates how an existing object detector can be adjusted to address specific tasks and how these modifications can impact the detection of small objects. In particular, we explore and introduce architectural changes to the different components of the popular YOLOv5 model in order to improve its performance in the detection of small objects for autonomous driving. Initially, we propose group depthwise separable convolution as the improved convolution unit to replace standard convolution. We then integrate this unit to create the attention-based dilated CSP block. Lastly, this block is combined with several proposed modules, including the improved SPP, improved PANet, and improved information paths, to form our IS-YOLOv5 model. We also integrate kernel pruning on the network to accelerate the model deployment on vehicle-mounted mobile platform due to limited computing resources and real-time constraints. Specifically, we propose the versatile network pruning (VNP) technique based on Taylor criterion ranking to prune less-essential kernels in the network. We will show that our modifications barely increase the complexity but significantly improve the detection accuracy and speed. Compared to the conventional YOLOv5, the proposed IS-YOLOv5 model increases the mAP by 8.35% on the BDD100K dataset. Besides, our proposed model improves the detection speed in FPS by 3.10% compared to the YOLOv5 model. When using the VNP scheme, FPS is further increased by 52.14%, while the model size and complexity are reduced by 39.29% and 47.81%, with almost no change in mAP. Nevertheless, when compared to state-of-the-art models, IS-YOLOv5+VNP is found to be conducive to the deployment in autonomous driving systems.

AB Survival Analysis is essential in the manufacturing field to determine unnecessary events by the input data. In Survival analysis, predictive maintenance plays a major portion in the identification of machine failures based on incoming input data from diverse equipment or sensors. Therefore, the Deep learning method is exploited for barbarizing the issues of predictive maintenance marginally but these techniques are not quite useful to predict the failure of devices for certain input data which the technique had not learned. Meanwhile, the neural network techniques are capable of predicting the output in accordance with the preceding input feature, the performance was poor when the input features have large variations. As a result, the transformation of input data degrades the performance of the neural network and the algorithm does not support the prediction of machine failure. To overcome such drawback, this paper proposes a novel Sugeno Fuzzy Ensemble Convolutional based War Strategy Algorithm (SFEC-WSA) to classify the device and identify the survival time in accordance with the input features. The proposed SFEC system integrates the process of both the Sugeno fuzzy integral ensemble model and the Attention-based Bidirectional CNN-RNN Deep Model (ABCDM). The SFEC-WSA algorithm is applicable in learning diverse input feature variations thereby predicting the robustness of the input data. The proposed SFEC-WSA analyses several parameters such as vibration, rotation, voltage, and pressure to evaluate the condition of the equipment. The experimentation results revealed that the proposed model effectively predicts large test data and performs better than other approaches.

AB This study aims to create a precise skin cancer classification system (SC-CS) able to distinguish various skin cancer types. Targeted categories include melanoma, vascular lesions, melanocytic nevus, cutaneous fibromas, benign keratosis, and different carcinomas and skin moles. The system employs image segmentation and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms within a double artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS) ensemble model, optimizing results weighting for superior solution quality. Evaluation of the SC-CS involved assessing metrics like accuracy, precision, AUC, and F1-score, and gathering feedback from 31 volunteers, including dermatologists, medical professionals and other medical staff with expertise in skin cancer diagnosis. The system accurately classified varied skin cancer types using HAM10000 and malignant vs. benign datasets, chosen for their broad representation and research utility. With over 99.4% accuracy, it surpassed state-of-the-art models by 2.1% for larger and 15.7% for smaller sizes. The high system usability scale (SUS) score of 96.85% signals strong user satisfaction and recommendation potential. High data security ensured patient privacy, with no access to personal information. Uploaded data and images are promptly deleted after processing. The system aids dermatologists in accurate skin cancer diagnosis, integrating into workflows with resource requirements. Performance varies with image quality, dataset diversity, and population-specific variations.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Accurate surface electromyography decoding of hand gestures is pivotal for advancing human-computer interaction applications. Recent developments in end-to-end deep neural networks have facilitated the automatic extraction of features from raw signals; however, not all extracted features are relevant and unimportant information can impede gesture estimation. Additionally, the accuracy of hand gesture estimation often declines when applying pre-trained models to new users. Therefore, a deep learning model using attention mechanism and transfer learning for electromyographic hand gesture estimation is proposed in this study. The proposed model consists of a feature extractor, a label classifier and a gesture estimator. A convolutional neural network is employed as the feature extractor, enabling the learning of high-level discriminative features from input signals. Attention modules are integrated into the convolutional layers, enhancing the extraction of pertinent features by emphasizing critical information through weight recalibration. The label classifier, consisting of three fully connected layers, classifies gesture labels using feature maps generated by the feature extractor. The gesture estimator, which adopts a threshold voting algorithm, is capable of estimating gestures during hand movement, making it suitable for real-time hand gesture estimation. A transfer learning approach is utilized to selectively transfer parameters from a pre-trained model to a target model, which is then partially retrained with limited target data. The proposed model is evaluated on both the Myo dataset and the public NinaPro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed transfer learning method proves more effective than training a new model from scratch, as retraining the target model with only two sessions yields satisfactory estimation accuracy.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB With the development of cloud computing, a growing number of applications are migrating to a cloud environment. In the process, the real-time scheduling of workflows has gradually become a technical challenge, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of cloud environments and the complex dependencies between sub -tasks of the workflow. Although various methods have been reported up to now, these methods have their respective shortcomings, such as heuristic-based methods are hard to find optimal scheduling scheme and metaheuristic-based methods incur high computational overhead, which often lead to the violation of QoS (Quality of Service) requirements and increases service renting costs of executing workflows. Inspired by the successful application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in cloud job scheduling, this paper proposes a real-time workflow scheduling method which combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and DRL, aiming to reduce both execution cost and response time. To be specific, we design a real-time workflow scheduling algorithm named GA-DQN by combining the global search capability of GA and the environment awareness decision -making capability of DRL to divides scheduling process into two stages. First, the execution scheme of workflow in virtual machine is calculated when workflow arrives. Then, a DRL agent uses this scheme as the feature of workflow to assign workflow to a suitable virtual machine. In this way, the use of DRL to sense environment increases the computational efficiency of GA, and the execution scheme obtained by GA helps DRL to obtain the feature of workflow. On this basis of real world workflow, three groups of simulation experience are carried out to compare GA-DQN with four baseline method which consist of three traditional methods and a state-of-the-art method. The comparison results demonstrate that GA-DQN outperforms the other methods in terms of response time, execution cost, and success rate across different workloads and cloud instance configurations.

AB It is one of the hot topics in the field of computer vision to estimate the density of vehicles on the road by using UAV equipped camera. Because the vehicle scale in video images is variable, the scene is complex and the change of vehicle density has strong randomness, the estimation results of vehicle density obtained by the existing methods have large errors. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a vehicle density estimation network based on multi-scale sensing of vehicle density (DSNet). The network adaptively senses the vehicle density in video images through an innovatively designed density sensing module and generates feature maps with different densities. Combined with the context information extracted from the network, the appropriate weight for each density-specific feature map is generated. By fusing the feature maps with different weights to enhance the feature of vehicle. Finally, the enhanced feature map is further refined to obtain a high-resolution density map. In addition, to solve the problem of the global counting loss (LC) that the global estimation results are good but the local estimation errors exist, we design and add the new region-aware loss (LG) to enhance the local feature extraction ability of the network and improve the robustness of the network. Experimental results show that the GAME of DSNet on the VisDrone 2019 dataset and DETRAC dataset is reduced to 5.45 and 6.07, respectively. Compared with the current state-of-the-art vehicle density estimation methods, DSNet achieves higher accuracy in the vehicle density estimation tasks of different scenes.

TI Tensor-based consensus learning for incomplete multi-view clustering

DE Incomplete multi-view clustering; Tensor low-rank; Consensus latent
   representation; Missing-view reconstruction
ID RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK
AB As a challenging task in the field of unsupervised learning, incomplete multi-view clustering can fully utilize multi-view information in the absence of partial views. Nevertheless, most existing methods still suffer from the following two limitations: (1) The missing views are ignored in matrix factorization or self-representation learning, which might not effectively explore the complementary information of incomplete views. (2) They fail to mine the high-order inter-view relationships in consensus graph learning, which can directly affect the accuracy of the learned consensus graph. To this end, this paper proposes an effective consensus learning model, referred to as tensor-based consensus learning for incomplete multi-view clustering (TCLIMC). Specifically, in TCLIMC, the missing views of incomplete instances are reconstructed, and the reconstructed views are devoted to exploring the consensus latent representation shared by all views and self-representation of each view. Meanwhile, the consensus graph learning is enhanced by combining self-representation learning and tensor low-rank constraint. In addition, the consensus latent representation and consensus graph are correlated by graph regularization, which enhances the compactness of the consensus latent representation and the accuracy of the consensus graph. At last, the clustering results on eight incomplete multi-view datasets verify the effectiveness of TCLIMC. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JSMMu/TCLIMC.

TI Incorporation of company-related factual knowledge into pre-trained
   language models for stock-related spam tweet filtering
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Language model; Knowledge incorporation; Factual knowledge;
   Post-training; Form 10-K filing; Stock-related spam filtering
AB Natural language processing for finance has gained significant attention from both academia and the industry as the continuously increasing amount of financial texts has resulted in an increasing demand for text analysis tools. Most previous studies regarding the development of pre-trained language models for financial applications have focused on obtaining linguistic instead of factual knowledge for solving real-world tasks, such as stock-related rumor detection. Factual knowledge is critical for performing tasks that require fact-verification. However, the incorporation of financial facts into pre-trained language models has not been sufficiently discussed. In this study, we adopt a post-training approach with a masked language modeling objective to incorporate company-related factual knowledge into existing pre-trained language models effec-tively and efficiently. Specifically, we propose an easily implementable knowledge incorporation framework that uses Form 10-K filings as a textual knowledge base, which applies a novel company name masking method that masks tokens corresponding to company names, thereby allowing the model to learn company-related information in a sentence. To assess this improvement quantitatively, we propose an evaluation framework that adopts a stock-related spam tweet filtering task as a downstream task. We hypothesize that the factual knowledge-enhanced model can distinguish between non-blue-chip and blue-chip stocks, thereby presenting a better performance in detecting spam messages that promote non-blue-chip stocks as if they were blue-chip stocks. Extensive experiments based on various amounts of training data for spam filtering tasks demonstrate that the proposed company name masking method significantly outperforms baseline methods in low-resource settings with training data sizes of 400 or less. In addition to financial applications, we anticipate that the proposed approach, which automatically extracts information regarding certain types of entities in a sentence, will contribute to other applications such as patent-examining procedures that require background knowledge to understand technological terms.

TI IMDet: Injecting more supervision to CenterNet-like object detection

DT Article
DE Deep learning; General object detection; CenterNet-like detectors;
   Target assignment; One-level-feature object detection
AB CenterNet-like object detectors are known for the concise post-processing method. But there are two bottlenecks that limit its further research and development. The first one is they just encode one positive sample for each object in the classification task, failing to make full use of supervision information. And simply encoding multiple positive samples is not as effective as expectation. The other one lies in that they perform predictions on one large-resolution feature map, not fully exploiting the insights of multi-level-feature object detection. The two shortcomings make their accuracy lag behind the detectors with one-to-many label assignment strategy and Feature Pyramids Networks (FPN). To solve the two issues, we first propose the Gaussian-based Target Assignment strategy (GTA) to effectively encode multiple positive samples. The GTA is supported by three rules and achieved cost-free. Second, we devise the Balanced Supervision Network (BSN) to ease the optimization of backbones. Through injecting more sufficient and balanced supervision, the proposed two methods improve CenterNet-like detectors to a competitive performance. The effectiveness of each method is fully verified on large-scale datasets with different data distributions, i.e., the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC dataset.

AB It is unquestionable that health, both individually and collectively, is the most important issue in life, which is why human beings pay special attention to health maintenance and recovery. The correct performance of the services attracts the patient's satisfaction, which is not only influenced by the latest technology and is influenced by many variables. Therefore, the present study provides a dynamic expert system of patient satisfaction with an integrated approach of system dynamics, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Analytic network process (ANP). First, the general structure of the problem was determined based on ISM modeling, and the formulation was done in Vensim software. Then, the validation tests, including the behavior reproduction test and the sensitivity analysis, were carried out, and the accuracy of the system was proved. In this regard, the ISM method was used to identify the levels of causal relationships between the studied variables, and the most influential variables were identified. Then, the most important criteria were identified with the ANP method and used in identifying policies. Finally, the simulation was carried out, and different policies were reviewed. The results showed that the criteria were placed on three levels, and the type of connection and their importance were clearly defined. The ISM and ANP methods have an interesting synergy with the system dynamics approach and help identify leverage points. According to the results, managers can adopt strategies that affect patient satisfaction with the greatest impact and the least action and take corrective measures.

AB Proof-of-principle studies suggest that seizure prediction from non-invasive device recordings may be feasible. However, the discovery of optimal biomarkers is an ongoing research task. We aim to evaluate seizure related differences in peripheral neurophysiological recordings by proposing a biomarker that allows classifying between pre-ictal and time-matched inter-ictal data from epilepsy patients. We include 42 pediatric epilepsy patients admitted for continuous video-EEG monitoring at Boston Children's Hospital (21 with tonic-clonic seizures and 21 controls). With a wearable biosensor, we select 45 min of pre-ictal data from seizure patients and 45 min of time-matched data from control patients. We analyze electrodermal activity and heart rate recordings by three different architectures of deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA)-based autoencoder. The clustering accuracy and improvement over chance are reported. The best DCCA technique is DCCA with a gated recurrent unit with a clustering accuracy of 68.9% and a relative improvement over chance of 37.8%. Clustering accuracy is better than chance for 71% of patients. Seizure prediction utilizing unsupervised clustering based on DCCA analysis of coupled changes in heart rate and electrodermal activity is feasible in a majority of patients with seizures.

AB The study aims to develop a robotic mood transition for a patient robot with emotional expression abilities in care education. The RU-FEMOIN database is utilized for the emotional expressions of the robot, which contains facial expression images of 41 Japanese people divided into different age groups. The primary objectives of the study are to provide feedback to caregivers to react immediately to the emotions felt by the robot during care training and to establish seamless communication of emotions between caregivers and the robot. This method ensures that the user's emotions are reflected in the robot's emotions, and the robot can express continuous mood transitions. A robot's mood transition is generated based on the user's current facial expression, according to the RU-FEMOIN database, to achieve interaction between the patient robot and caregivers. The study presents an advanced patient robotic system based on human-robot interaction on the CNT using the robot's facial expression method.

   learning; Human alignment
AB Research into algorithmic trading using reinforcement learning has been garnering increasing popularity in recent years. While most research work focuses on solving a certain modelling problem or data problem with positive results, we believe that in an application as critical as financial trading, aligning the machine to human behaviours is imperative and should be regarded as the basis of all further improvements before machine algorithms are free to go their own innovative ways. In this paper, we are proposing a trading model whose design principles are based on bringing a machine trading agent close to a human trader. We study areas where human alignment is necessary and introduce as a solution a novel multi-loss function of the model combining supervised learning, single-step and multi-step Q learning, and also inject the paradigm of imitation learning in the training and trading processes. We also introduce a realistic backtesting setup and a holding position aware profit calculation scheme under which the machine algorithm conducts intra-day trading using minute tick data over a group of U. S. stocks chosen to represent different industrial sectors and liquidity levels. Our model's overall out-performance over a group of baseline models as well as our ablation study results justify the inclusion of individual model features all of which are introduced to bring aspects of the model behaviour more aligned with those of a human trader.

AB Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) based on temporal phase unwrapping (TPU) is one of the most important three-dimensional (3-D) structured light (SL) reconstruction techniques. However, there is an inevitable contradiction between the number of auxiliary coded patterns and the measuring speed. To mark a large number of fringe order in high-frequency fringe projection or wide-field scenes, commonly-used strategy is to add more coded patterns, which compress heavily the ratio of phase-shifting patterns carrying the 3-D shape information of object. In this paper, a phase shift coding method is developed to mark fringe order, in which three phase-shifting patterns and one auxiliary coded pattern can obtain high-quality wrapped phase and fringe order at the same time. In addition, an interleaved projection can provide two fringe order with different densities to extend the coding range of fringe order, while ensuring the measuring speed. Experiments with various static and dynamic objects demonstrated that the proposed method with the advantages of flexibility, high-efficiency coding can achieve the reconstructing rate of 30 fps for 8-bit fringe projection. This method should be highly meaningful for practical applications of 3-D face modeling, industrial inspection, intelligent recognition, virtual reality, and so on.

TI Recommendation based on attributes and social relationships
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Recommender systems; Social relationship; Attribute; Attention mechanism
AB Attributes are important auxiliary information for representing user and item features, especially in data-sparse scenario, and can serve as their main source. However, different attributes have different importance for representing users or items, and users have different preferences for different attributes of an item, which is often ignored in current research. With the rapid development of social network platforms, the use of users' social relationships to improve and enhance the performance of recommender systems has also received considerable attention. However, most studies have treated the influence of different social relationships in the same way. Different social friends have different influences on users' preferences. To solve these problems, this study proposes a recommendation model based on attributes and social relationships. In the model, we use attributes to learn the feature representations of users and items, while we use social relationships to augment the feature representations of users. We developed two attention mechanisms: attribute-level and social-level. The former was used to distinguish the relative importance of different attributes, and the latter was used to model the influence of different social relationships. The novel recommendation model in this study innovatively combines attribute information and social relationships to improve feature representation learning of users and items, and to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. Extensive experiments on public datasets have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model, and comparisons with different baselines showed significant improvement in recommendation accuracy.

   neural network; Residual neural networks; Facial expression
AB Memristor devices are promising nanoscale low-power components, which are expected to significantly reduce power consumption and improve speed of deep learning accelerators if the longitudinal and transverse structure is used. However, memristor devices such as resistive random access memory and phase change memory are difficult to manufacture in small batches because they are prone to various device nonideality. It is particularly important to simulate the performance of memristor deep learning systems and test the effects of nonideal characteristics before circuit level implementation. In this paper, a large-scale memristor-based neural network based on residual neural networks is built to study the influence of non-ideal characteristics of memristors. The influence of four types of non-ideal characteristics on deep learning models is analyzed. The corresponding solutions are discussed. The non-ideal characteristics are tested on the constructed memristor-based neural network. The recognition accuracy of the neural network based on two ideal memristor models reach 64.84% and 64.63% respectively. The further test results show that with the increase of non-ideal characteristics, the recognition accuracy decreases, which prove that the non-ideal characteristics of memristors have a great influence on the practical application of deep learning models, and provide guidance for the practical application of memristors.

AB To reduce energy consumption (EC) in the wastewater treatment process (WWTP) for achieving energy conservation and emission reduction, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) applied in WWTP needs to have better convergence and diversity. In this paper, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III based on utopian point improvement (NSGAIII-UP) is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantage that multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on utopian point decomposition (MOEA/D-UP) cannot handle the multi-segment discontinuous Pareto front (PF) problem well. By comparing the proposed NSGAIII-UP with 8 advanced algorithms by 2 metrics on 22 benchmark functions, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in dealing with the complex PF problems is proved. Moreover, a multivariable model predictive controller (MMPC) is used to control the dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in WWTP, in which NSGAIII-UP is applied to the upper EC optimization of WWTP. The simulation results show that compared with the closed-loop control, the EC in the WWTP is reduced by 7.395 %, and the lowest EC is achieved compared with the other 8 algorithms. It helps to reduce energy waste in WWTP and promotes ecological sustainability. The source code of NSGAIII-UP is publicly available at https://github.com/sut16/NSGAIII-UP.

AB Despite an ever-increasing growth of interest in the video game industry, the significance of video gaming evaluation of perspectives still needs sufficient investigation. With the development of virtual space and video games in recent years, players are looking for quality games in terms of content and graphics. This research examines the various dimensions of video game development, obtaining player satisfaction and increasing the profit from attracting players. A descriptive and informative evaluation procedure is investigated in this research to address this issue. According to previous studies, the necessity of an accurate evaluation is demanding in the video game industry. Therefore, this research deals with a multi-directional evaluation procedure where different descriptive criteria are weighted using a novel Gray FUCOM approach. The value of the proposed novel approach is linked with uncertainty or lack of consensus, which deals with given linguistic terms of opinion significance. Perspectives about the video game industry are introduced as video game criteria for Gray-FUCOM-based evaluation of uncertain opinions. Then, it is compared with the existing crisp FUCOM to show the reliability of this evaluation. This research also clarifies the definition of gray numbers and their integration with the FUCOM optimization methodology in a new aspect. The Deviation From sub-criteria (DFC) as a performance measure (objective function) is calculated to be non-zero, as illustrated by the inconsistency of experts' uncertain opinions. Furthermore, the results show that developing video games that benefit from suitable multiplayer and rich quality and storyline regarding maps, personalization, various missions, challenging skills, and supporting regulated modes can attract many players and increase the developers' incomes. Examples of successful video games in multiple dimensions are also presented.

AB This article investigates the adaptive fuzzy prescribed time H-8 congestion control problem for a class of high speed transmission control protocol/active queue management (HSTCP/AQM) systems subject to asymmetric input saturation and external disturbance. Firstly, a saturation-based finite-time performance function (SFTPF) is constructed by introducing a nonnegative modified signal associated with input saturation errors into user-defined performance boundaries, which features the capability of ensuring the user-appointed tracking performance when no saturation exists and degrading it once saturation occurs, thereby effectively increasing the flexibility and reliability of the control scheme. Then, by designing a novel shifting function, the condition that the initial value of the queue tracking error remains within that of SFTPF is relaxed, which avoids the SFTPF being redeveloped for different initial queue tracking errors. Thereafter, an auxiliary system and H-8 control theory are employed to eliminate the adverse effect caused by input saturation and external disturbance, respectively. Moreover, through the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that, under our proposed adaptive fuzzy congestion control scheme, all the closed-loop signals are bounded, and the connection between input saturation and performance-related constraint is established. Finally, a set of simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed congestion controller.

AB Rapid and non-destructive classification of seed varieties is one of the important goals pursued by modern seed industry. Due to the large number of maize varieties in practice, collecting training samples that exhaust all varieties to train a classifier is extremely difficult. Therefore, maize seed classification in the real world faces the challenge of variety renewal and rejection of unknown varieties. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable incremental learning (IL) framework based on hypercube data. This method achieves class-IL via learning oneclass classifier (OCC) incrementally, and directly uses raw data as input without additional data preprocessing and feature extraction. The OCC is a dual deep support vector data description, which makes full use of spectral and spatial information to establish an exclusive hypersphere for a specific variety to receive the variety and reject unknown varieties. To remove the interference of redundant bands, a band attention and sparse constraint module is added to automatically assign the weights of redundant bands to zero, thereby maximally improving the performance of the model. Moreover, a new loss function is defined to alleviate the difficulty of parameter updating after sparse constraint. Experimental results on our open set indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method for receiving known varieties and rejecting unknown varieties are both above 91 %, which has significant advantages over the other two state-of-the-art IL methods. In the future, the corresponding OCCs can also be deleted from the whole framework according to the varieties eliminated by the government to reduce computational overhead and inter-class interference. Overall, the proposed method can perform both IL and open set recognition.

TI RMCA U-net: Hard exudates segmentation for retinal fundus images

DE RMCA U-net; Channel attention; Multi-scale feature fusion module;
   Residual module; Hard exudate
AB Hard exudate plays an important role in grading diabetic retinopathy (DR) as a critical indicator. Therefore, the accurate segmentation of hard exudates is of clinical importance. However, the percentage of hard exudates in the whole fundus image is relatively small, and their shapes are often irregular and the contrasts are usually not high enough. Hence, they are prone to misclassifications e.g., misclassified as part of the optic disc structure or cotton wool spots, which results in the low segmentation accuracy and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel neural network RMCA U-net to accurately segmentation hard exudate in fundus images. The network features a U-shape framework combined with a residual structure to obtain the subtle features of hard exudate. A multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF) module and an improved channel attention (CA) module are designed and involved to effectively segmentation sparse small lesions. The proposed method in this paper has been trained and evaluated on three data sets: IDRID, Kaggle and one local data set.

ID KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK
AB Event logs are a powerful source of digital evidence as they contain detailed information about activities performed on a computer. Forensic investigation of the event logs is a challenging and time-consuming task due to their large volume and continuous generation. A significant amount of time, effort, and knowledge is required to interpret their contents, discovering irregular events that are potentially pertinent to the investigation. As the number of digital investigations increases, so too must resources available to investigators. This requires new techniques to make the process easier and faster, reducing the burden on human investigators as well as being resource efficient. In this paper, a novel solution is presented to examine event logs and automatically identify irregular activities during forensic analysis. The proposed solution utilises a rare itemset mining approach to establish relationships among event entries, based on their contents. Following on, identified event relationships are ordered based on their temporal order to represent the timeline or sequence of activity. The solution is also capable of prioritising identified activities by calculating their degree of irregularity. The empirical analysis is performed on 15 live machines, and the results are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance metrics.

AB This study proposed an efficient ECG preprocessing technique, and the preprocessed ECG data was subsequently used to classify atrial fibrillation (AFib) using end-to-end deep neural networks. This is significant since early identification of AFib can help to prevent mortality. With this in mind, the two-fold study is proposed, in which three denoising autoencoders for ECG signal pre-processing were evaluated and compared. Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) utilising convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as backbones outperformed the other two DAE models. As a result, the preprocessed signal is then used to classify atrial fibrillation using the three classification models. The combination of CNN-based DAE and CNN-based classification model yielded the best results, with 99.20 percent accuracy, 99.50 percent specificity, 99.50 percent sensitivity, and 99.00 percent true positive rate. The average accuracy of the algorithms we investigated was 96.26 percent, and our technique was 3.2 percent more accurate than the other algorithms we compared. Furthermore, with a 24-h ECG signal processing time of only 1.3 s, the proposed model is computationally inexpensive for real-time applications. To determine its robustness, the proposed framework is tested on previously unseen datasets with varied proportions of arrhythmias, producing a 99.10 percent recall rate and a 98.50 percent accuracy.

AB With the growing interest in win-win cooperation within the logistics industry recently, collaborative multicenter logistics networks have witnessed the establishment of numerous alliances aimed at achieving cost savings. However, alliance members may choose to withdraw from an alliance due to changes in market positioning strategies and short-term profit considerations. Such withdraws often lead to the disintegration of the alliance and result in financial losses for the remaining non-defaulting members. This study focuses on addressing the issues of compensation and profit allocation in a specific scenario known as the collaborative multicenter vehicle routing problem with time windows and defaulting members withdrawal (CMVRPTWDMW). The objective is to ensure alliance stability and fair profit distribution among its members. To achieve this, a tri-objective mathematical model is proposed to optimize the re-formed alliances by considering the total operating cost, number of vehicles, and service waiting time. Additionally, an improved minimum cost remaining saving method is introduced to accurately quantify the deserved profits of non-defaulting members. Compensation quantification and default cost allocation models are then developed based on this analysis. To solve the CMVRPTWDMW and obtain Pareto optimal solutions, a hybrid heuristic algorithm is designed. This algorithm combines a 3D k-means clustering algorithm for customer reassignment after the withdrawal of defaulting members, effectively reducing the complexity of the problem. Furthermore, the algorithm employs a Clarke-Wright saving method-based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (CW-NSGA-III) to search for optimal solutions. To enhance the algorithm's search ability, an elite alteration strategy and a penalty-based boundary intersection approach are incorporated into CW-NSGA-III. Finally, a real-world case study conducted in Chongqing City, China, is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed models and solution algorithms. The study contributes valuable insights into the sustainable operation of urban logistics networks that may experience unpredictable defaults, providing guidance for the stability of logistics alliances in the transportation sector.

ID IDENTIFICATION; FRAMEWORK
AB In this article, a deep neural network (DNN)-driven metamodel is first introduced to damage identification of trusses utilizing acceleration signals incompletely measured from limited sensors. This metamodel can automatically learn its damage-sensitive properties itself to construct a better DNN from previously trained poorer ones. Data utilized to build such a model are generated by finite element method (FEM). In which, inputs are the acceleration behavior corresponding to measurement sensors, and outputs are the damage ratios of truss members. The damage site and extent of low-risk members predicted by the current DNN are eradicated by a suggested damage threshold. This helps to dramatically reduce the number of output units to feed into the next DNNs. By repeating such a procedure, the subsequently upgraded DNNs become more precise after several iterations although they only require a simple network architecture, fewer samples, small epochs and less computational effort. To illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the present metamodel, four 2D and 3D trusses with various damage scenarios are investigated. Obtained results indicate that the suggested approach can reliably diagnose both the location and severity of damaged truss members using acceleration behavior measured by a few sensors in a relatively short period of time, even with high noise levels.

AB In this study, a novel graph-based hybrid deep learning model of cumulative GRU and deeper GCN was proposed to discover the most representative spatial-temporal gait dynamic features in non-Euclidean space based on the graph for limb joint coupling, significantly improving the generalization of detecting abnormal gait with wearable sensors. The cumulative GRU module first captures the most valuable temporal dependence features by cumulating the useful temporal dependency information from each gait-graph joint node. And then deeper GCN module constructed by residual connection and pre-activation technique is adopted to exploit the best spatial dependency features from the cumulated temporal dependency features by stacking deeper graph convolutional layers. These extracted spatial-temporal gait abnormality features significantly contribute to classifying abnormal gait-graph accurately. Our simulated abnormal gaits data acquired by multi-sensors positioned on lower limb joints are used to feasibly evaluate our method. The experimental results showed that our method with five graph convolutional layers could reach the highest accuracy of 99.02% compared with existing models. Recall and Precision could achieve approximately 100% to identify a certain abnormal gait. Normal lower limb locomotion changes in gait abnormality could be precisely measured. Our technique could feasibly explore the most representative spatial-temporal gait dynamic characteristics in gait-graph for discriminating abnormal gait with high-generalization.

DE Compound fault diagnosis; Generative adversarial networks; Generative

ID MULTIPLE FAULTS
AB Diagnosis of compound faults remains a challenge owing to the coupling of fault characteristics and the exponential increment of the number of possible fault types. Current compound faults diagnostic methods often require a large number of training data for each type of compound fault. In real-world scenarios, training data of compound faults are usually difficult to acquire and sometimes even inaccessible. In contrast, single fault samples are much easier to obtain. Thus in this paper inspired by the idea of zero-shot learning, we present a novel label information vector generative zero-shot model to identify unknown compound faults, using only single fault samples as the training set. This model comprises several modules, namely label information vector (LIV) definition, feature extractor, and generative adversarial modules, respectively responsible for representing the prior knowledge of specific class labels for the single fault and compound fault, extraction of fault features, and mapping the relationship between the fault features and the fault LIVs. By adversarial training between the samples and LIVs of single faults, the model can generate compound fault features using the compound fault LIVs. Thus the unknown compound faults are identified by measuring the distance between the features extracted from the testing compound fault samples and the generated features from LIVs. The proposed method is evaluated on a self-built experimental platform. The results demonstrate that without any compound fault samples in the training set, the compound fault classification accuracy of the model reaches 78.10%.

AB Emotions are what makes us humans. Recognizing human emotions from facial micro expression features help us learn the true emotional state of a person. This technique of classifying the micro expressions can be used in varied application domains like criminology, marketing, job analysis, online learning etc. The field of recognizing micro emotions deals with tracking, recognizing, estimating & sequencing and classifying the recognized expressions. Artificial intelligence plays a crucial function in modern era of technology; micro expression analysis forms an ideal candidate of Deep Learning to correctly recognize these micro expressions when on display. The aim is to build a system that takes in a video data from any source and to recognize the micro expressions exhibited at various points in time. The challenge to overcome is to capture the fast changing expressions and to extract and align these facial features in order to extract suitable frames that provide the information from which the micro expressions can be ascertained by introducing it to a swarm optimization approach called the Artificial Bee Colony Approach. Implemented a novel approach that captures the essence of the micro expressions by an optical flow vector technique, that supplies its input to the modified deep learning Convolutional Neural Network, that in turn, is trained to categorize micro expressions on display. The Convolutional Neural Network combined with the Swarm Optimizer was able to achieve an accuracy of around 99.45% in identifying & classifying the facial micro expressions.

   Parallel corpus filtering
AB Parallel corpus filtering (PCF) aims to filter out low-quality data residing in parallel corpora. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been employed to assess the quality of sentence pairs in a parallel corpus, along with rule-based filtering that filters out noisy data depending on the pre-defined error types. Despite their utilization, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive investigation into the practical applicability and interpretability of PCF techniques remains unexplored. In this study, we raise two doubts on deep learning-based PCF: (i) Can deep learning-based PCF extract high-quality data? and (ii) Are scoring functions of PCF reliable? To answer these questions, we conduct comparative experiments on various PCF techniques with four datasets on two language pairs, English-Korean, and English-Japanese. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that the performance of the deep learning-based PCF highly depends on the targeting parallel corpus, and shows fluctuating adaptability depending on their characteristics. In particular, we figure out that high-scored sentences derived by the PCF technique do not necessarily guarantee high-quality results, rather it shows unintended preference.

AB The evaluation of aerodynamic performance is a crucial aspect of aircraft design optimization. However, traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive. While machine learning techniques can achieve high accuracy, their application in engineering is challenging due to their poor generalization and "black box" nature. In this paper, a knowledge-embedded meta-learning model is proposed that integrates data with theoretical knowledge to predict lift coefficients for a supercritical airfoil at various angles of attack. The model employs a primary network to capture the relationship between lift and angle of attack, and a hyper network to encode geometry information and predict unknown parameters in the primary network. Three models are trained with different architectures to provide various interpretations. The model exhibits better generalization capabilities and competitive prediction accuracy compared to conventional neural networks. Additionally, interpretable analysis is performed using Integrated Gradients and Saliency methods, revealing that this model can assess the influence of airfoil geometry on physical characteristics. Furthermore, exceptional cases are investigated where the model's performance is reduced, analyzing the impact of knowledge limitations on a knowledge-embedded predictive model.

TI Learning knowledge graph embedding with multi-granularity relational

DE Knowledge graph embedding; Multi -granularity implicit interaction;
   Heterogeneous relation; Augmentation feature
AB Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to complete link prediction tasks effectively by learning the representation of entity and relation. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved prominent results for learning KGE. However, knowledge graphs typically contain massive information about entities and relations, and existing deep neural network-based KGE models exploit semantic information from simple explicit feature concatenation and reshaping without considering bidirectional implicit interactions, which cannot accentuate relevant predictive information. Additionally, these models simply extract nonlinear features from embedded matrices of relations, resulting in neglecting the distinctive semantic connotation of heterogeneous relations. To overcome these two challenges, a multi-granularity relational augmentation network (MRAN) to learn KGE is proposed. Specifically, multi-granularity implicit interaction embeddings are generated to facilitate relevant predictive information selection, which model bidirectional implicit interactions between entities and relations in Euclidean space, complex space, and quaternion space. Moreover, relational augmentation convolution module utilizes relation-aware filters at the convolutional layer to preserve the distinctive relational properties for dealing with heterogeneous relations. Subsequently, the augmentation mechanism is injected to focus on informative features and restrain useless features of neural networks, which boosts the quality of KGE. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding link prediction results of MRAN on five benchmark datasets, revealing the benefits of considering bidirectional implicit interactions and heterogeneous relations. Our model substantially improves efficiency while achieving excellent performance, which is superior to state-of-the-art baseline models in 2 out of 4 metrics on WN18 and in 3 out of 4 metrics on FB15k-237 and YAGO3-10 datasets.

AB This paper presents a wavelet-based real-time automated fire detection algorithm that takes into consideration the multi-resolution property of the wavelet transforms. Unlike conventional fire detection algorithms, which fail to capture temporal dependency within the fire sensor signals, the proposed wavelet-based features characterize temporal dynamics of chemical sensor signals generated from various types of fire, such as flaming, heating and smoldering fires. We propose a new feature selection technique based on types of fire to select the best features that can effectively discriminate between normal and various fire conditions. Then, a real-time fire detection algorithm with a multi-modeling framework is developed to effectively utilize the selected features and construct multiple fire detectors that are sensitive in monitoring various kinds of fires without prior knowledge. In addition, we develop a novel multi-sensor fusion system that incorporates various chemical sensors and collects an accurate and reliable fire dataset from different real-life fire scenarios in order to validate the performance of the proposed and existing fire detection algorithms. The experimental results with real-life and public fire data show that the proposed algorithm outperforms others with early detection time with a reasonable false alarm rate regardless of the type of fire.

AB This work considers a restructured electricity market where the agents are considered as entities, and each agent has a learning capability. Also, the Independent System Operator (ISO) adopted the nodal pricing technique for managing transmission line congestion. In this multi-agent platform, the objective of each Generating Company (GenCo) agent is maximizing its net earnings. GenCo exhibits economic capacity withholding to enhance its daily net income ports updated cost parameters to the ISO. The basic model free policy-based reinforcement algorithms fail to calculate the probability that the rewards obtained are negative or zero. To overcome this drawback, the co-learning agent-based modeling approach implements an interactive learning algorithm applied to GenCo's for reward consideration in all respects and thereby applies the strategic approach in improvising marginal pricing, commitments, and net incomes. The co-learning effect of GenCo is accomplished with the optimum value of the learning parameters by deploying a novel interactive Variant Roth - Erev (VRE) Reinforcement learning technique for efficient electricity market operation. The introduction of various parameters in learning helps to improve the mutual interaction among the agents and provides better experimentation implementable by GenCo's meeting the social welfare and smart bidding. The result presented in this paper suggests that the learning capability of the agents is having an impact on the marginal pricing, which supports the operator in managing the congestion in the transmission line. The analysis showcases the effectiveness of the co-learning approach adopted by the agents in the electricity market which is tested on a standard IEEE system and the performance of the technique is validated on a realistic Indian grid network.

AB Introducing clean energy into urban cold chain distribution to achieve a green transition is crucial for reducing transportation and logistics emissions and promoting sustainable urban development. This study focuses on the Cold Chain Green Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Mixed Fleets (CC-GMD-VRPTW-MF) for city logistics distribution, utilizing both electric vehicles (EVs) and gasoline and diesel vehicles (GDVs). To accurately assess energy consumption, a realistic energy consumption model is employed. The CC-GMD-VRPTW-MF aims to minimize total costs (including fixed, energy consumption, damage, and environmental costs). To address the problem, we propose an improved Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm that introduces a new balanced mechanism for perturbation and a new memory-based mechanism for local search to enhance computational performance. Numerical studies on newly designed CC-GMD-VRPTW-MF instances are conducted to investigate the effect of incorporating EVs for joint delivery, considering different carbon prices, and adjusting time windows. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed improvement strategies in VNS and demonstrate the algorithm's performance on benchmarks of related problems.

AB Food security is currently a major concern due to the growing global population, the exponential increase in food demand, the deterioration of soil quality, the occurrence of numerous diseases, and the effects of climate change on crop yield. Sustainable agriculture is necessary to solve this food security challenge. Disruptive tech-nologies, such as of artificial intelligence, especially, deep learning techniques can contribute to agricultural sustainability. For example, applying deep learning techniques for early disease classification allows us to take timely action, thereby helping to increase the yield without inflicting unnecessary environmental damage, such as excessive use of fertilisers or pesticides. Several studies have been conducted on agricultural sustainability using deep learning techniques and also semantic web technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, the three major challenges remain: (i) the lack of explainability of deep learning-based systems (e.g. disease information), especially to non-experts like farmers; (ii) a lack of contextual information (e.g. soil or plant information) and domain-expert knowledge in deep learning-based systems; and (iii) the lack of pattern learning ability of systems based on the semantic web, despite their ability to incorporate domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents the work on disease classification, addressing the challenges as mentioned earlier by combining deep learning and semantic web technologies, namely ontologies and knowledge graphs. The findings are: (i) 0.905 (90.5%) prediction accuracy on large noisy dataset; (ii) ability to generate user-level explanations about disease and incorporate contextual and domain knowledge; (iii) the average prediction latency of 3.8514 s on 5268 samples; (iv) 95% of users finding the explanation of the proposed method useful; and (v) 85% of users being able to understand generated explanations easily-show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of performance and explainability and is also suitable for real-world scenarios.

AB In recent years, the optimization community has witnessed a surge in the popularity of population-based optimization methods. However, many of these methods suffer from various shortcomings, including unclear performance characteristics, incomplete validation, excessive reliance on metaphors, inadequate exploration and exploitation components, and compromised trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in real-world scenarios. As a result, users often find themselves needing to extensively modify and fine-tune these methods to achieve faster convergence, stable balance, and high-quality results. To shift the optimization community's focus towards performance rather than metaphorical changes, we propose a general population-based optimization technique called the Great Wall Construction Algorithm (GWCA). This study presents GWCA as a simple yet robust method with competitive performance for efficiently solving constrained and unconstrained problems. GWCA draws inspiration from the competition and elimination mechanisms observed among workers during the construction of the ancient Great Wall. It introduces a mathematical model of the labor movement to simulate the algorithm's dynamics. Unlike other methods that employ multiple models to generate new solutions, GWCA randomly assigns a single predefined motion model to each worker in every iteration. This unique approach showcases GWCA's dynamic nature, simple structure, high convergence performance, and ability to deliver satisfactory solution quality, thus outperforming existing optimization methods in terms of efficiency. To validate GWCA, we conduct extensive comparisons with popular and advanced algorithms on the IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark suite across different dimensions (D = 10, 30, 50, 100). Additionally, GWCA is applied to solve 16 constrained engineering problems and 6 NP-Hard problems, demonstrating its applicability in handling constrained and complex nonlinear problems. Finally, we compare GWCA's optimized solutions with those obtained from 33 advanced meta-heuristic algorithms, including the winner of CEC 2017. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimizer in solving a wide range of single-objective problems, surpassing popular base optimizers, advanced variants of existing methods, and several CEC winners. We present GWCA as an open-source population-based method that can serve as a standard optimization tool across various domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It exhibits a range of exploratory and exploitative features, offering high performance and optimization capabilities. The method is highly flexible, scalable, and can be further extended in terms of structure and application to accommodate diverse forms of optimization scenarios. https://github.com/guangian/Great-Wall-Construction-Algorithm-a-novel-meta-heuristic-algorithm-for-global-optimization.

AB In concrete design, the compressive strength of the concrete is the critical parameter that defines the quality of concrete. Determination of the compressive strength of concrete by laboratory testing is the conventional way, however, with the help of advancements in technology, the development of an exact predicting technique for the compressive strength of concrete will reduce time as well as cost to a greater extent. There are various types of concrete, as concrete is the most used material and has wide applications in the construction sector and hence huge article is being done to increase the performance of concrete. In this paper, the compressive strength of High-Performance Concrete and Fiber Reinforced High Strength Self-Compacting Concrete is predicted by next three main stages, namely (a) pre-processing, (b) feature extraction, and (c) prediction of concrete compressive strength. Initially, in the data pre-processing phase, duplicate data samples are removed. Subsequently, various features like statistical features, symmetrical uncertainty-based features, higher order statistical features, ReliefF feature, and are derived from the pre-processed data. In the prediction phase of concrete compressive strength, a hybrid algorithm is designed by mingling the concepts of Deep Belief Network and Long Short-Term Memory. Moreover, The Rock Hyraxes Updated Sparrow Algorithm is used to fine-tune the weights of DBN to improve the prediction accuracy of the suggested work. The suggested hybrid optimization method is the hybridization of the standard Sparrow Search Algorithm and Rock Hyraxes Swarm Optimization, respectively. Eventually, the output from the optimized hybrid method will reveal the compression energy of concrete. Ultimately, the efficiency of the suggested method is verified by the comparative estimation. The MAPE of the suggested method is 235.32, which is 30.6%, 21.64%, 20.4%, and 11.4% superior than the CLPSO, ABC, SSA + Hybrid Classifier and RHSO + Hybrid Classifier, respectively.

TI An explainable machine learning approach for student dropout prediction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Dropout prediction; Machine learning; Explainable model
AB School dropout is a relevant socio-economic problem across the globe. Predictive models have been developed to determine the likelihood of students dropping out of their studies precociously to overcome such a problem. Academic systems, which gather data from many students, are potential sources for datasets that feed dropout prediction algorithms, thus leading to general improvements in education quality. Despite successful past attempts to predict dropout, several works depict small datasets with features that are hard to reproduce. Furthermore, predicting whether a student will drop out is not enough to diagnose and prevent the problem as it is also necessary to provide potential justifications for the dropout. This paper proposes an approach for creating and enriching a dataset for dropout prediction, which has been applied for dropout prediction using data from 19 schools in Brazil. With this dataset and using classifiers and model explaining techniques, our experiments achieved Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) scores of up to 89.5%, Precision up to 95%, Recall up to 93%, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) rates up to 97% when predicting dropout at different year moments. This study also shows differences when predicting dropouts in different educational stages, such as preschool and secondary education, with the former being more complex than the latter. In addition to the high recognition rates, our proposal identifies potential reasons for student dropout, which are relevant for educational institutions to take preemptive actions.

AB As an important component in rotating machines, gearbox failure will lead to costly economic losses. Generally, incipient fault features of gearbox are weak and concealed in a set of time-varying vibration signals that are challenging to identify effectively. Based on that, a new method is proposed for incipient fault detection(FD) under steady and variable conditions of gearboxes based on improved octave convolution in this paper. First, the vibration signals are transferred into images via the symmetrized dot pattern(SDP) method. Then, the proposed method enhances image detail learning by adding convolution kernels and introducing residual connections in the high-frequency component of the octave convolution. Meanwhile, self-attention units are introduced in the information interaction branches. After that, the improved octave convolution is applied to the ResNet50 backbone network(IOC-ResNet50) to mine deep fault features. Compared with other published methods, the results indicate that the proposed performs superiorly in both time-varying conditions and steady state.

DE Latent interpolation; Post-hoc explanation; GAN inversion
AB Extensive research into eXplainable AI (XAI) has raised interest in generating counterfactual (CF) explanations. In the past, minimizing the perturbation of input was considered a priority aspect of CF for the benefit of user practicality. However, closeness to the CF data manifold, indicating plausibility, is now emerging as another important property of CF. Thus, we propose a novel framework for generating practical and plausible CFs by minimally perturbing the semantic information of inputs in a disentangled latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Considering the possibility of linear change of semantic information in a disentangled latent space, we obtain the desired CFs using proposed algorithms that adjust the input latents and reference CF latents derived using an optimization-based GAN inversion method . The results of qualitative and quantitative experiments on several datasets from different domains demonstrate the superiorit y and versatility of our framework. In comparative experiments, it not only achieves 1.0 Validity for test samples from a l l datasets but also achieves the minimum values of 0.07 Dissimilarity, 5.96 Rec. Error, 0.94 IM1, and 0.01 Infer. Time for the MNIST dataset.

AB The residual nodes energy consumption is a primary factor to extend the lifespan of network. Utilizing a sensor node's very low-power battery in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) is still a difficult task. To increase the network lifespan, this paper proposes an Energy Efficient Region based Source Distributed Routing Algorithm for Sink Mobility in Underwater Sensor Network (EERSDRA-GCOP-UWSN). The proposed work consists of three Phases that are initialization phase, Routing Phase and Data transmission. For initialization phase, sinks and the sensor nodes are initialized. For Routing phase, Energy EERSDRA with sink mobility is employed to identify the region of sensor nodes. For data transmission phase, Geographic and Cooperative Opportunistic Protocol is proposed to select the best relay node on the basis of depth fitness factor. The proposed EERSDRA-GCOP-UWSN is evaluated with the performance metrics. Then performance of the EERSDRA-GCOPUWSN proposed method provides 18.409%, 13.843% and 23.768% high Network lifetime, 27.744%, 24.881% and 19.703% low energy consumption, 17.346%, 20.852% and 26.347% high throughput and 16.385%, 20.416% and 22.907% high PDR when compared to the existing methods such as, Energy-efficient regional based cooperative routing protocol with sink mobility for UWSN (EERCRP-UWSN), a safe energy efficient and cooperative routing protocol for UWSN (SEECRP-UWSN), geo-opportunistic routing protocols for improving the residual energy range (EEGORP-UWSN) methods respectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed method achieves better result while compared to the existing methods.

AB Resource management in the next-generation vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication networks is a demanding research problem. It is difficult to achieve the best results if the resources are not managed efficiently. To address this challenge and facilitate the dynamic movement of network demands, efficient management of resources is crucial. In this context, we propose a duplex deep reinforcement learning (DDRL)-based resource management framework for next-generation V2X communication networks. Our framework considers multiple network state parameters and utilizes these resources during the learning phase to address resource management problems effectively. The key objective was to select the forthcoming resource control state through the duplex deep reinforcement learning phase, thereby optimizing resource utilization efficiency. To achieve this, we jointly implement time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD), which allow for adaptive management of TDD and FDD to meet high mobility requirements and efficiently utilize limited radio resources. This study introduces a dynamic duplex deep Q-learning-assisted sequential decision-making algorithm to manage band resources for the next-generation V2X network. By employing this algorithm, we enable the efficient allocation of resources, considering factors such as latency, system throughput, network utilization, busy channel rate (BCR), and packet received rate. To validate the performance of our proposed framework, we conducted simulation experiments using benchmarking techniques. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms benchmark approaches across various performance parameters. It exhibits superior efficiency in terms of latency, system throughput, network utilization, BCR, and packet received rate.

AB Code classification is a meaningful task with plenty of practical applications. Combined with recently popular graph neural networks (GNNs), a body of research attempts to address the code classification problem with the help of fruitful achievements from the deep learning (DL) area. We systematically investigate the practices of existing works on the GNN-based code classification task and find out three important but often overlooked questions. (1) Existing works usually illustrate the effectiveness of GNNs in code classification tasks by contrasting them with non-graph baselines. But the contribution of the message-passing mechanism, which is at the core of GNNs, has not been shown on its own. So how does the message-passing mechanism help code classification? (2) Various problem formulations, model architectures, and learning objectives have been suggested in the literature to apply GNNs to code classification. In practice, how should we make choices among them? (3) One of the most prominent applications of code classification is automated vulnerability detection. However, learning-based vulnerability detection has not been widely accepted as a practical approach. How does GNN-based code classification perform in this task, especially in real-world scenarios? A comprehensive experimental study is conducted around these questions to evaluate the performance and feasibility of the GNN on different datasets and scenarios. Results suggest it is not easy to make the GNN perform well on the code classification task in the face of the intricate nature of programs. Interesting findings about the effectiveness of GNNs with different training objectives are reported for the first time in this paper, providing insights that can inform future research on code classification with GNNs.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, is a significant financial asset for investors, but predicting its price is challenging due to its volatile and erratic nature. In this study, we suggest a novel ternary-frequency (TF) prediction scheme for Bitcoin prices, which combines complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), a time series clustering method, and the reconstruction of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In the proposed scheme, CEEMDAN was utilized to decompose Bitcoin's daily price into IMFs, then prototypes of time series clustering were used to construct robust ensemble clusters. The IMFs in the ensemble clusters were reconstructed into ensemble time series and then identified as three different frequencies, which were respectively used in a prediction model to generate different predicted values, and then aggregated to produce the final prediction results. To generate three different TF Bitcoin price prediction schemes, this study employed three prominent prediction algorithms: autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB); these resulted in three distinct models, named TF-ARIMAX, TF-MARS, and TF-XGB. Empirical results from the two daily Bitcoin and one daily Ethereum closing price datasets showed that the proposed TF prediction scheme outperformed other benchmark approaches. Moreover, among the three TF models, TF-MARS produced superior prediction accuracy compared to both TF-ARIMAX and TF-XGB models, and proved to be an effective alternative for cryptocurrency price prediction.

AB Bike-Sharing Systems (BSSs) have exploded in popularity worldwide because of their beneficial impacts on traffic, pollution levels, and public health, which has resulted in moving toward a green city. The rebalancing problem, as one of the most important operational problems of such systems, deals with planning bike distribution at different stations. Regarding conducted studies, simulation models are the most common tool for analyzing BSSs and decision-making. This popularity is based on simulation's capabilities in modeling complexities of systems and uncertainty. Despite their advantages, lack of quickness is a significant drawback of simulation-based methods, making them inefficient for real-time decision-making processes, especially in largescale and complex systems. In this regard, this paper introduces a Supervised Learning-Based Simulation (SLBS) method as an alternative to the conventional simulation-based methods dealing with rebalancing problems. SLBS is a huge step toward developing a real-time Decision Support System (DSS) for BSSs. For developing SLBS, firstly, we have developed a simulation model based on real-world assumptions of station-based BSSs and big data analysis of CitiBike, a well-known BSS located in New York City. The simulation model is able to calculate the number of unsatisfied demands (either number of failed pick-ups (FPs) or failed drop-offs (FDs)) as a result of different rebalancing plans. Then, the developed simulation model was used to generate quality and quantity training datasets to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms involved in SLBS. While these ML models are trained once, SLBS will be capable of predicting the number of unsatisfied demands without running highly time-intensive simulations replications. The results obtained from a wide range of conducted experiments indicate that SLBS, up to 300 times faster than simulation models, can provide predictions with over 90% of R2 Score.

AB Infrared small-target detection (ISTD) is an important computer vision task. ISTD aims at separating small targets from complex background clutter. The infrared radiation decays with distance, making the targets highly dim and prone to confusion with the background clutter, which makes the detector challenging to balance the precision and recall rates. To deal with this difficulty, this paper proposes a neural-network-based ISTD method called CourtNet, which has three sub-networks: the prosecution network is designed to improve the recall rate; the defendant network is devoted to increasing the precision rate; the jury network weights their results to adaptively balance the precision and recall rates. CourtNet takes the structure of Transformers, whose feature resolution remains unchanged. Furthermore, the prosecution network utilizes a densely connected structure, which can prevent small targets from disappearing in the forward propagation. In addition, a fine-grained attention module performs attention inside patches to accurately locate the small targets. This paper implements extensive experiments on two ISTD datasets, MFIRST and SIRST, and compares CourtNet with ten other traditional and deep-learning-based methods. Experimental results show that with the fast detection speed (60.61 FPS), CourtNet achieves the best F1 score, 0.62 (in MFIRST) and 0.73 (in SIRST), among the compared methods. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/PengJingchao/CourtNet.

AB It is well known that the decision-making on treating gastric cancer is usually the summary of several experts' advice. Moreover, the interpretability and reliability of a model used to assist doctors with final decisions are very important in gastric cancer. Thus, this paper designed an ensemble belief rule base (EnBRB) model to ensemble multiple BRB models and predict the statement of pathological complete response (pCR), aiming to simulate the expert consultation widely used for clinical decisions on gastric cancer. In EnBRB, five BRB models were built individually using experts' knowledge and trained through patient treatment information. Furthermore, the final output was calculated via the evidential reasoning (ER) based ensemble strategy on the results of each BRB for a more reliable decision. Then, to improve the model's performance, a two-stage approach with a differential evolution (DE) algorithm was designed to enhance the performance of EnBRB. The experimental results demonstrated that a higher accuracy (0.9296 & PLUSMN; 0.0521) and AUC (0.9570 & PLUSMN; 0.0368) were obtained by our EnBRB. Moreover, the difference between sensitivity and specificity achieved by EnBRB was smaller than other comparison methods.

AB The literature has recognized that the consumers' purchase behaviour and retailers' policies are significantly influenced by reference price effects, but has yet to provide flexible operational decisions on the threshold-based reference price. In this study, we consider an infinite-horizon joint pricing and inventory control problem in which the customers' psychological behaviour is modelled as reference price effects and price thresholds. Spe-cifically, there is a region of price insensitivity allowing for threshold effects around the reference price, which is formulated as a three-regime piecewise function with the consideration of gain, loss, and indifference. A reso-lution approach based on proximal policy optimization is proposed to address the combinatorial complexity of continuous domains in action-state spaces. Tested on eight different market environments, we demonstrate how the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches the ground-truth algorithm and outperforms three other al-gorithms. Moreover, near-optimal strategies and convergence results are obtained with regard to initial states and price thresholds of the system. The results show that the order-up-to level is increasing in price thresholds and the sales price is decreasing in them, while the retailer's profits suffer from the increase in thresholds. Be-sides, the sales price is increasing in the reference price. In the steady state of the environment, the average profits are higher than those in which the retailer ignores reference price effects with thresholds. Our study provides evidence that black-box DRL algorithms can effectively solve joint pricing and inventory control problems with psychologic and behavioural concerns.

AB Many real-world multi-objective optimization problems are dynamic. These problems require an optimization algorithm to quickly track optimal solutions after changing the environment. In most dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms, response mechanisms are used to generate the initial population after the environment changes. In the present study, a novel Combinational Response Mechanism (CRM) is proposed, which consists of three parts. After detecting the environmental change, in the first part, RM-rand, a subpopulation of random solutions is generated using DE/rand/1 operator and Cauchy mutation. The second part, RM-Tr & SP, predicts a subpopulation of solutions using transfer learning (TL) and special points. The third part, RM-M, uses the best solutions of the previous environment with a propagation method based on crowding distance to generate the third subpopulation. A combination of the solutions of these three subpopulations is considered the initial population of the new environment. The proposed response mechanism can converge the set of solutions while maintaining their diversity. Thus, generating solutions with good convergence and diversity makes the initial population more adaptable to the new environment. The examinations were done on 24 common test functions. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed response mechanism in dynamic multi-objective optimization is competitive with five advanced evolutionary algorithms.

ID APPROXIMATE
AB Reinforcement learning for nonstationary problems is a subject of widespread research given that most realistic problems do not exist within static environments. Approaching these problems can require significant effort in feature engineering to provide a learning algorithm with enough useful information about the state space to uncover complex system dynamics. As an alternative for problems with sufficient data describing the nonstationary environment, we propose the contextual decomposition Markov decision process (CDMDP) as a collection of stationary sub-problems intended to approximate nonstationary problem dynamics using a linear combination of value functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDMDP approach with an application in military air battle management. We use a designed computational experiment and analysis of variance to show that a complex, nonstationary learning problem can be effectively approximated with a small set of stationary sub-problems, and that the CDMDP solution significantly improves solution quality over a baseline approach without the need for additional feature engineering. If a researcher suspects that a complex and continuously varying environment can be approximated by a small number of stationary contexts, the CDMDP framework may save significant computational resources and yield decision policies that are much easier to visualize and implement.

AB Perishable product delivery has been a notable challenge due to the nature of perishability and high customer expectations. Recently, emerging technologies such as electric and multi-compartment vehicles have been applied to facilitate perishable product deliveries with less deterioration and carbon emissions. Accordingly, new management problems are placed including setting environmental conditions of compartments, routing and scheduling the recharging of vehicles. To deal with these difficulties, we introduce the multi-compartment electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and temperature and humidity settings (MCEVRP-th). A mathematical formulation is proposed, and a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search heuristic (ALNS/TS), which allows generating infeasible solutions, is developed. Extensive experiments assess the performance of the proposed algorithm based on the modified benchmark and real-world instances, and several management insights are derived.

AB Semi-supervised semantic segmentation aims to classify the pixels with both labeled and unlabeled images. How to utilize unlabeled images is a key part of semi-supervised learning. The existing methods tend to exploit the reliable pixels which can be classified to a specific category with high reliability, ignoring the unreliable pixels which cannot be identified into a special category with low reliability, resulting in information loss. Moreover, uneven number of pixels per category often leads to misclassification of small-scale category pixels. In this paper, we propose a multi-reliability and multi-level feature augmentation framework. Multi-reliability feature augmentation dedicates to extract unreliable/reliable pixel features to take full advantage of pixel information. Multi-level feature augmentation dedicates to extract category/image level semantic features to avoid the sparse semantic information provided by category with a small number of pixels, which can lead to misclassification. Furthermore, a variety of data perturbations are employed to enhance the robustness of our model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/JianJianYin/MMFA.

AB House price prediction is one of the most important factors affecting national real estate policies. However, developing an accurate housing price prediction model is a significant challenge for the real estate market. This study presents a framework of house price prediction models that address this issue by improving forecasting performance, explicitly demonstrating the novelty in the Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (HBO) models combined with Stacking (HBOS), Bagging (HBOB), and Transformer (HBOT) techniques. These hybrid models employ Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, leading to superior prediction accuracy and stability. Additionally, the proposed framework can assess a statistical and accurate assessment of the predictive performance of house price forecasting models in different scenarios. Furthermore, we constructed a multi-source dataset containing 1,898,175 transactions of the Hong Kong real estate market covering a period from January 2, 1996, to May 13, 2021. This dataset, another major contribution to the field, enables comprehensive model testing and could be a valuable resource for future research. Then, the proposed hybrid models are compared with 18 benchmark models. Thirteen evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the predictive performance, while the non-parametric testing, including Friedman, Iman-Davenport, and Nemenyi post-hoc tests methods, are adopted to assess the significance of differences in the predictive performance of each model. The experimental results show that the HBOS models are superior to the other benchmark models for application in the house price prediction problem. The HBOS-CatBoost model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE compared to both the HBOB-XGBoost and HBOT-ConvLSTM models, with relative RMSE reductions of 5.11% and 25.56%, respectively. The main contributions of this work are the creation of a rich multi-source dataset, the proposal of novel hybrid models for improved house price prediction, and a comprehensive performance evaluation framework. These findings offer a significant step forward in the housing price prediction field.

AB Speech authentication in smart services typically involves short utterances. However, due to the short duration of these utterances (e.g. less than 3 s) and the limited enrolment and/or test data available, it is difficult to learn enough information to accurately distinguish the person. As a result, speaker recognition from short utterances is very challenging. In this paper, in the acoustic end. we propose a novel Bark-scaled Gaussian and linear filter bank cepstral coefficients (BGLCC) and multi-dimensional central difference (MDCD) acoustic features extraction method. Also, to enhance the discriminative embedding, in the network end, a novel attention-enhanced DenseRes2Block network is proposed. First, the rich low-frequency information is extracted based on the high distribution density of the Bark-scaled Gaussian filter bank in the low-frequency domain, and more high-frequency information is extracted based on the linear filter bank uniformly distributed in the high-frequency domain. This means that the combined filters can produce more discriminative and richer acoustic features from shortduration audio signals. In addition, the multi-dimensional central difference method captures better speaker dynamic features in the relative BGLCC domain to improve the performance of short utterance speaker recognition. Finally, an attention-enhanced Dense-Res2Block architecture can obtain a variety of feature expressions of different scale combinations to enhance features. Extensive analysis of a variety of datasets, which speech samples of different types, diverse lengths, etc., demonstrate the superiority of the proposed feature extraction method and model over existing acoustic feature extraction methods and speaker recognition models, including those based on MFCCs, LPCCs, and fusion features, and X-vector-PLDA, BLSTM-ResNet, ResNet34-SP, ECAPATDNN respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance compared to the existing approach.

AB Suicide causes approximately 800,000 deaths worldwide annually, meaning one death every 40 s. Suicidal ideation is the first stage in the risk scale, in which the individuals have thoughts about being dead. Prevention strategies may focus on individuals in this stage. Therefore, this research proposes Thoth, an intelligent model for assisting people suffering from suicidal ideation by analyzing Context Information, such as sensor, psychological, and sociodemographic data. The main scientific contribution is the personalized assistance for individuals at risk of suicidal ideation by analyzing Context Information for anticipating risk identification. A prototype allowed the data collection of 3 patients between 25 and 36 days. Data augmentation techniques helped in creating a database that allowed the model evaluation. The experiments showed that Gated Recurrent Unit models achieved an F1-Score of 94.12%, 92.44%, and 92.61% for predicting suicidal ideation on the following day, considering Histories of 3, 5, and 7 days, respectively. The patients and therapists assessed the model through the Technology Acceptance Model and a semi-structured interview. The patients felt comfortable sharing personal data and providing accurate information to the tool. The therapists highlighted the constant asynchronous monitoring strategy employed by the model, allowing early actions to mitigate future risks.

AB In real-world multi-criteria group decision making challenges, decision makers typically provide imprecise or ambiguous information due to a lack of knowledge, time constraints, or restrictions regarding information disclosure. In order to deal with this sort of imprecision caused by experts' subjective evaluation, fuzzy sets have been suggested. When compared to traditional fuzzy sets, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, also known as IVIFSs, are superior when it comes to dealing with subjective ambiguity and incomplete information. For these reasons, this work provides a novel extension for the TOPSIS technique by employing likelihoods of IVIFSs, and introduces a methodology named as TOPSISort-L that is capable of classifying alternatives under a variety of circumstances. We begin by developing the conventional fuzzy TOPSIS technique by using a newly proposed decision matrix, a novel selection mechanism for ideal solutions, and a generalized likelihood-based closeness metric for the purpose of alternative ranking. After that, the TOPSISort-L algorithms are presented to obtain an accurate classification for the alternatives when there are information about the characteristic profiles, and also obtain an approximate classification when information about the characteristic profiles is missing. Eventually, by contrasting the approach with various different methodologies now in use, we exhibit the validity and adaptability of the method.

AB One driving application for multi-robots is source seeking, especially in the hazardous environment. It consists of two essential subtasks: source location and path search. Nature inspired meta-heuristic is preferable in addressing the source location subtask which is an inversion problem, while the Astar algorithm and its variants are widely used for the path search subtask. In this paper, we present a multi-robot team simulator as a container which contains both algorithms as components. The simulator takes the constraints into consideration, including the size and the speed bound of each robot, the obstacle and collision avoidance. We provide a python implementation and example problems for research and test purposes. The well-structured code with object-oriented design can be conveniently upgraded by adding new excellent nature inspired metaheuristics, or extended to other source seeking problems in various field applications. The python code can be downloaded from the website: https://github.com/buctlab/source-seeking-multi-robot-team-simulator.

AB Automatic fault diagnosis in many systems is performed via the analysis of vibration data in the time or frequency domain. In the literature, many approaches for extracting featured from signals for fault diagnosis have been proposed. In this paper, we apply a variety of transform functions including Fourier, Wavelet, etc. to extract features from the vibration data, which includes the statistical features and some features automatically extracted via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For each of these feature extraction approaches, a learning algorithm is trained to diagnose the faults and their results are aggregated in an ensemble machine learning algorithm. The weights of the base learner algorithms are optimized via an evolutionary algorithm to achieve the best-weighted voting scheme. The architecture of CNNs has a significant effect on the performance of the algorithm, thus, in this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to find the best architecture for CNNs in fault diagnosis. The CNNs are trained via gradient descent algorithms which suffer from getting stuck in local optima. To manage this, we propose an evolutionary algorithm that benefits from the speed of gradient descent and the global search of evolutionary algorithms. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of benchmark problems and the experimental results are presented.

AB Linguistic labels are an effective means of expressing qualitative assessments because they account for the uncertain nature of human preferences. However, to perform computations with linguistic labels, they must first be converted into numbers using a scale function. Within the context of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the most popular scale used to represent linguistic labels numerically is the linear 1-9 scale, which was proposed by Saaty. However, this scale has been criticized by several researchers, and various alternatives have been proposed. There is a growing interest in scale individualization rather than relying on a generic fixed scale because the perceptions of the decision maker regarding these linguistic labels are highly subjective. The methods proposed in the literature for scale individualization focus on minimizing transitivity errors (i.e., consistency). In this paper, we propose a novel, easy-to-learn, easy-to-implement, and computationally less demanding scale individualization approach based on compatibility. We also developed an experimental setup and introduced two new metrics that can be used by researchers that contribute to the theory of AHP. To assess the value of scale individualization in general and the performance of the proposed novel approach, numerical and two empirical studies were conducted. The results of the analyses demonstrate that scale individualization outperforms the conventional fixed-scale approach and validates the benefits of the proposed novel heuristic.

AB Uploading images to the cloud has increasingly become a trend, and users have therefore enjoyed many benefits brought by the cloud. On the other hand, these images may carry a wealth of sensitive information, which threatens privacy. Some traditional encryption schemes, in which the original image with rich information is encrypted into the noise-like image, may be able to deal with privacy threats but give up visual usability. Recently, thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) was proposed to balance visual usability and privacy but exposes too much information in the encrypted image. Motivated by this, the existing TPE schemes are analyzed in-depth and the scheme to encrypt the image based on cross-plane thumbnail preservation is proposed. A novel architecture of permutation-substitution matching this scheme is constructed, which can preserve the visually semantic information in the encrypted image to balance usability and privacy, and the balance is people-oriented. Meanwhile, a prototype of the scheme is proposed by using a chaotic system, and experiments are conducted using the prototype to verify the excellent performance of this work, e.g., the visual effect is achieved to preserve the semantics, and it becomes the fastest scheme at present om terms of time cost.

AB This work introduces two new financial derivatives into the finance literature. The first is the return barrier option, which has emerged recently as a popular contract in the OTC markets. This contract is similar to a barrier option, but the knock-out event depends on an asset's returns, rather than its level. Its direct exposure to jump risk offers protection from a key source of market incompleteness, with great potential value to hedgers and investors. The second contract is the return timer option, which is proposed in this work for its natural relation to the return barrier option, and by analogy to Timer Options written on realized volatility. This contract offers similar upside potential to a European option, but can be purchased at a substantial discount, a trade-off for bearing jump risk. Due to the dependence of these contracts on single (daily) return events, capturing jump risk is essential to their pricing, as diffusion-based models are unable to generate sufficiently heavy tails at short time horizons. Thus we provide analytical pricing formulas for the return barrier option, along with efficient and accurate numerical methods under Exponential Levy dynamics, to capture the heavy tailed returns. We then prove that the return timer option can be conveniently priced as a linear combination of return barriers, providing a consistent pricing framework for the combined family of derivatives. Given the recent trend in return barrier options in OTC markets, as well as the interesting mathematics required to price them, this work offers both practical and theoretical contributions to the literature.

ID SELECTION
AB Keyword extraction is the foundation for solving various text mining tasks. However, the literature heavily relies on statistical, linguistic feature-based, or graph-based metrics to gauge corpus-representative keywords, the process of which is sensitive to preprocessing and stopword selection. In this paper, we propose a general-use keyword extraction model designed to work with document groups of various sizes, domains, and readability, as well as the existence of keyword labels. To extract a better selection of keywords, we employ a simple logistic regression model with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization (Tibshirani, 1996). The classification-based structure of our approach ensures learning words that distinctively characterize the given document group against the comparison groups, enhancing the representativeness of the extracted keywords. Furthermore, our model repeatedly modifies coefficients as it learns the document label classifiers, rather than relying directly on the term frequencies, reducing the model's sensitivity to words of very high and very low frequencies. We test our model's performance against numerous classic keyword extraction frameworks as baseline models using online customer reviews, news articles, and patent documentation. The results indicate that our proposed method has robust performance in terms of representability and distinctiveness across document groups with varying sizes, number of class labels, levels of readability, and domain. Additionally, we show that our model beats baseline models even when applied to documents without class labels compared with the baseline models. Given its generalizability and simplicity, we believe that our proposed model may serve as an easy-to-use, yet a powerful, general-use tool for keyword extraction, especially when working with various groups of documents from different domains.

AB Double compression detection is one of the most popular techniques for the authentication of images and videos in the sphere of multimedia forensics. Several forensic methods have been suggested revealing video forgery, particularly high-efficiency video codec (HEVC) double compression detection. Even though forensic methods can effectively validate the integrity of videos, they become more intricate while practicing anti-forensic (AF) on manipulated videos. In this study, we present an innovative counter-anti-forensic (CAF) approach to detect anti-forensically misguided HEVC double compressed videos with the same coding parameters using coding pattern analysis. We mainly focus on employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) attacks to reconstruct artifacts that appear in compressed videos for deceiving forensic methods. In the proposed CAF method, we apply AF attacks twice in primary and secondary compressions and analyze the coding pattern changes to build a CAF method. We extract syntax information, and introduce new syntax map representations to improve distinguishability between single and double-compressed sequences. Additionally, we apply Gaussian and median filtering as AF attacks to show the robustness of the proposed method. The proposed deep learning-based CAF method shows better performance and can overwhelm state-of-the-art works.

AB The recognition of affective states is important for regulating stress levels and maintaining mental health, and it is known that affective states can be inferred from physiological signals. However, in practice, the problem of affect recognition contains many challenges due to various types of external noise and different individual characteristics. This paper proposes a deep learning model called Attention-LRCN for recognizing affective states from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We construct a long-term recurrent convolutional network to extract temporal features from spectrograms, and a novel attention module is introduced to alleviate the effect of noise components in PPG signals. Moreover, to improve the recognition accuracy, we propose a weighted knowledge distillation technique, which is a teacher-student learning framework. We quantify the uncertainty of teacher's predictions, and the predictive uncertainty is utilized to adaptively compute the weight of the distillation loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the WESAD dataset, which is a public dataset for stress and affect detection. We also collected our own dataset from 34 subjects to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous algorithms on both the public and real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/ziiho08/Attention-LRCN.

AB The acquired hob vibration signals are inevitably contaminated by noise in the industrial environment, which changes the vibration signal frequency distribution and reduces the accuracy of feature extraction and hob wear identification. To solve this problem, a novel hob vibration signal denoising and effective feature enhancement method, CEEMDAN-FRS, is proposed based on the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and fuzzy rough sets (FRS). First, the effective frequency distributions of gear hobbing, particularly the modulation sidebands, were obtained as prior knowledge by analyzing the hob vibration response mechanism. Then, the two key parameters of CEEMDAN (i.e., noise standard deviation and ensemble size) were adaptively determined based on signal characteristics to achieve improved decomposition compared with the use of fixed values. The evaluation and selection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on a single feature such as kurtosis or root mean square, only focus on the partial characteristics, leading to an identification bias. Thus, 11 features with different sensitivities of IMFs are weighted based on FRS, and fused as a unified feature to conduct a comprehensive IMF evaluation. Finally, a reweighted IMF reconstruction strategy is proposed. The comparisons of the proposed method and related approaches to hob vibration signals show that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of effective feature enhancement, noise removal, and signal-to-noise ratio improvement

AB The fight against offensive speech on the Internet necessitates increased efforts from linguistic analysis and artificial intelligence perspectives to develop countermeasures and preventive methods. Reliable predictions can only be obtained if these methods are exposed to a representative sample of the domain or environment under consideration. Datasets serve as the foundation for significant developments in this field because they are the main means of obtaining appropriate instances that reveal the multiple and varied faces of the offensive speech phenomenon. In this sense, we present Ar-PuFi, a dataset of offensive speech towards Public Figures in the Arabian community. With 24,071 comments collected from TV interviews with Egyptian celebrities belonging to six domains of public interest, Ar-PuFi is currently the largest Arabic dataset in terms of its category and size. The examples were annotated by three native speakers over the course of two months and are provided with two-class and six-class annotations based on the presence or absence of explicit and implicit offensive content. We evaluated the performance of a diverse set of classification models employing several text representations of actual examples (e.g., N-gram, TF/IDF, AraVec, and fastText), and AraBERT achieved the baseline for the new dataset in both offensive detection and group classification. Additionally, we apply the Pointwise Mutual In-formation (PMI) technique to comments within the target domain in order to derive a lexicon of offensive terms associated with each domain of ArPuFi. We further explored whether active learning (AL) or meta-learning (ML) frameworks could be used to reduce the labeling effort required for our dataset without affecting prediction quality and found that, though AL can reduce the amount of data annotations by 10% over the ML approach, neither approach requires less than about 70% of the full dataset to achieve baseline performance. Finally, we took advantage of the availability of relevant datasets and conducted a cross-domain experiment to back up our claims not only about the uniqueness of our dataset but also about the difficulty of adapting Arabic dialects against one another.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB To practice the evidence-based medicine, clinicians are interested to find the most suitable research for the clinical decision making. The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in evidence-based clinical decision support systems is becoming increasingly popular. However, existing KG construction frameworks are not fully automated and contextualized, thus unable to adapt to new domains and incorporate constantly changing information into their knowledge base, resulting in loss of relevance over time. Furthermore, existing KGs construction frameworks don't generate KG that provide relevant information within an acceptable response time for evidence-based practitioners because the organization of constructed subgraphs is neither topic-specific nor evidence-based PICO (Participants/Problem P, Intervention-I, Comparison C, Outcome O) query-friendly. By employing concept extraction, semantic enrichment, optimized clustering, and state of art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with BioBERT based encoded representation to categorize PICO elements and predict relationships be-tween concepts using huge corpus of publicly available literature on COVID-19 and cerebral aneurysm, this paper proposes a topic specific, PICO enabled, and fully automated framework to curate information and create KG of different clinical domains. The evaluation shows that the proposed framework achieves significant improvement over baseline models and has 93 %, and 82 % accuracy on aneurysm and COVID data set respectively for PICO classification. Also, the relationship extraction module has an accuracy of 96 % with precision and recall being 92 %, and 90 % respectively.

AB The Markowitz model, a Nobel Prize winning model for portfolio analysis, paves the theoretical foundation in finance for modern investment. However, it remains a challenging problem in the high frequency trading (HFT) era to find a more time efficient solution for portfolio analysis, especially when considering circumstances with the dynamic fluctuation of stock prices and the desire to pursue contradictory objectives for less risk but more return. In this paper, we establish a recurrent neural network model to address this challenging problem in runtime. Rigorous theoretical analysis on the convergence and the optimality of portfolio optimization are presented. Numerical experiments are conducted based on real data from Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) components and the results reveal that the proposed solution is superior to DJIA index in terms of higher investment returns and lower risks.

ID COLONY
AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning plays an essential role in agricultural production and biological control. To solve the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem, a multi-mechanism collaborative improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (NAS-GWO) is proposed. In NAS-GWO, the evolutionary boundary constraint processing mechanism is introduced to update the position of the grey wolf individuals that cross the boundary in time to retain the position information of the optimal individuals to the largest degree to enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm. Then, the Gaussian mutation strategy and spiral function are used as perturbation mechanisms to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimum in time to strengthen the exploitation capability of NAS-GWO. Meanwhile, the improved Sigmoid function is used as a nonlinear convergence factor for balancing the exploitation and exploration of the NAS-GWO. By comparing NAS-GWO with ten advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 20 CEC2017 benchmark functions, the experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm has superior merit seeking and robustness. Moreover, the agricultural UAV trajectory planning problem is solved using NAS-GWO. The experimental results show that the NAS-GWO algorithm plans a more viable and stable trajectory path in four different scale missions, while the most important is that it requires less cost. Among them, the algorithm reduces 27.93%, 38.15%, 32.32%, 34.11%, 10.63%, and 13.48% on average in cost function values compared to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Differential Evolution (DE), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), and Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO), thus proving the effectiveness and significance of NAS-GWO in the agricultural UAV trajectory path planning problem.

ID MULTISPECTRAL DATA; DISCRIMINATION
AB Remote sensing image fusion aims at fusing high spatial resolution single-band panchromatic (PAN) image with spectrally informative multispectral (MS) image to generate panchromatic sharpened image with high resolution and color information, it is also called pansharpening. Most of the proposed single convolutional neural network (CNN) or transformer-based pansharpening methods own several problems, such as inability to acquire long-range features or difficult to train, resulting the loss of spatial details and colors. In addition, the computational complexity of transformer cannot be ignored. In this work, we propose a dual-branch hybrid CNN-Transformer network (DBCT-Net) that utilizes the local specificity of CNN and models the global dependencies by transformer. First, a multi-branch dense connected block (MDCB-4) network is designed to obtain spectral and textural information in MS and PAN images, respectively. Next, an encoder-decoder transformer based on the self-attention and co-attention modules is able to inject the missing local and global information, which can further enhance the results. It is worth noting that an inverted multi-head transposed attention (IMTA) is applied here to build attention maps from feature dimensions, which greatly reduces the computation time. Finally, an image reconstruction module is employed to effectively fuse the acquired texture and spectral features. Furthermore, to generate visually better pansharpened images, we propose a combined loss function that includes a focal frequency loss. Extensive experiments on WorldView II (WV2), GF-2,and QuickBird (QB) datasets show that DBCT-Net can perform better in spatial preservation and spectral feature recovery.

TI WGAN-CL: A Wasserstein GAN with confidence loss for small-sample

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Image classification; Plant small-scale dataset; GAN; Data augmentation
AB The small-sample task is a current challenge in the field of deep learning, due to the huge annotation cost and the inherent limitations of targets, such as the acquisition of rare animal and plant images. Data augmentation is an effective method to solve the semantic sparseness and overfitting of deep convolution neural network in small-sample classification, but its effectiveness remains to be improved. We propose a Wasserstein GAN with confi-dence loss (WGAN-CL) to implement the expansion of small-sample plant dataset. Firstly, a shallower GAN's structure is designed to adapt to less plant data. Meanwhile, shortcut-stream connections are brought into the basic network to enlarge the solution space of the model without producing additional training parameters. Secondly, the Wasserstein distance combined with confidence loss is used for optimizing the model. Experiments demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty guarantees the stability of model training and the diversity of outputs. And the sample screening strategy based on confidence loss can ensure that the generated image is close to the real image in semantic features, which is critical for subsequent image classifi-cation. To verify the effectiveness of the WGAN-CL in plant small-sample augmentation, 2000 flower images of 5 categories in the "Flowers" dataset are utilized as training samples, while 2000 augmented images are employed for model training as well to improve the performance of a classical classifier. WGAN-CL has a significant per-formance improvement over state-of-the-art technologies, i.e., a 2.2% improvement in recall and a 2% improvement in F1-score. Experiments on the "Plant Leaves" dataset also achieved excellent results demon-strating that WGAN-CL can be migrated to other tasks. WGAN-CL uses less computational resources while considering both effectiveness and robustness, proved the practicality of our model.

DT Article
DE Structured hashing; Multipurpose retrieval; Discrete hash learning
AB Hashing has been widely studied in support of efficient multimedia retrieval due to its high computation and storage efficiency. However, existing multimedia hashing models are designed only for specific multimedia retrieval tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval and composite multi-modal retrieval. To simultaneously support multiple multimedia retrieval tasks, multiple different hashing models should be equipped in a multimedia retrieval system. This paper proposes a Structured Multi-Modal Hashing (SMMH) method, which can learn only a hash model for multiple multimedia retrieval tasks. Specifically, we generate structured hash codes by independently projecting the modality data into the Hamming space, where each part of hash codes preserves the specific characteristic of the specific modality data, and they are collaborated to represent the whole multi-modal data. To bridge the heterogeneous gap between multiple modalities, a fusion multi-modal space is constructed based on structured hash codes with label and pair-wise semantic supervision. Besides, we learn hash functions for composite multi-modal retrieval by projecting heterogeneous modalities into the collaborative multi-modal features. Finally, we develop a discrete hash optimization strategy to efficiently solve binary hash codes. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the strong baseline methods on multiple multimedia retrieval tasks. Source codes are available at https://github.com/ChaoqunZheng/SMMH.

ID EVOLVING DISPATCHING RULES; PRIORITY RULES
AB Surrogate evaluation is a useful, if not the unique, technique in population-based evolutionary algorithms where exact fitness calculation is too expensive. This situation arises, for example, in Genetic Programming (GP) applied to evolve scheduling priority rules, since the evaluation of a candidate rule amounts to solve a large number of problem instances acting as training set. In this paper, a simplified model is proposed that relies on finding and then exploiting a small set of small problem instances, termed filter, such that the evaluation of a rule on the filter may help to estimate the performance of the same rule in solving the training set. The problem of finding the best filter is formulated as a variant of the optimal subset problem, which is solved by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The surrogate evaluation of a new candidate rule consist in solving the instances of the filter. This model is exploited in combination with a Memetic Genetic Program (MGP); the resulting algorithm is termed Surrogate Model MGP (SM-MGP). An experimental study was performed on the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a machine with varying capacity over time, denoted (1, Cap(t)|| n-ary sumation Ti). The results of this study provided interesting insights into the problems of filter and rules calculation, and showcase that the priority rules evolved by SM-MGP outperform those evolved by MGP.

ID ATTRIBUTION
AB Authorship verification is the task of determining if a candidate is the real author of the provided sequences of texts. Stylometric learning is the study of the writing style by analyzing the textual data through computational approaches for many linguistic tasks such as authorship verification, authorship identification, etc. In recent years, Deep learning has been used as an effective solution to stylometric learning for authorship verification. However, most of the existing studies do not consider the semantic biases captured by the model, and the learned stylometric features include a strong indicator of the topical biases. During the extraction of stylometric features, we found that specific words related to the latent topics impact the performance of machine learning algorithms and, therefore, are not generalizable toward out-of-sample authors. In this paper, we propose a latent topic score dictionary with a Topic-Debiasing Representation Learning Model (TDRLM) for stylometric representation learning on the problem of authorship verification. The model applies position-specific topic scores on a topic-debiasing attention mechanism in order to adjust the tokenized texts based on the topical bias. The experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves the best performance with the highest Area Under Curve (AUC) of 92.47% for the Twitter-Foursquare dataset and 93.11% for the (ICWSM) Twitter dataset, both better than the state-of-the-art stylometric learning models and the up-trained language models.

AB Today, with the development of the Internet, e-commerce, and digital advertising, along with traditional advertising, have attracted the attention of many sectors and businesses, including the agricultural industry. One of the most consumed agricultural products is tea, which advertising plays a significant role in attracting more customers and improving the efficiency of its supply chain. Therefore, managing the supply chain of such product should be monitored and configured effectively considering sustainability aspects. The aim of this study is to design a dual-channel Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain (SCLSC) network for tea industry for the first time. Then, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed for optimizing the total costs, the number of emissions and the number of created job vacancies. In addition, customer demand is dependent on traditional and digital advertising rates and product prices. For solving this model in small dimensions, LP-metric method and in high dimensions, four meta-heuristic multi-objective algorithms including Simulated Annealing Algorithm (MOSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Gray Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) were used and their results and performance were compared. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to further evaluate some parameters such as demand. The obtained results confirmed the validity of the planned model and the correctness of its solution method. Finally, practical insights are provided for the related managers and tea producer countries.

   classification; Data synthesis
ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Automation of wafer map pattern classification has been an active research topic for identifying the root causes of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Building a classification model is a primary challenge owing to the high cost of labeling wafer maps with their defect categories to create a training dataset. Single defect wafer maps are relatively easy to label because their patterns are simple and clear. However, labeling mixed-defect wafer maps is difficult and time-consuming because they often have complex and ambiguous patterns. This study aims to address the problem of data insufficiency in which only normal and single defect wafer maps are present in the training dataset, whereas mixed-defect wafer maps are also present in the test dataset. We propose a method for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) by using a training dataset of normal and single-defect wafer maps to accurately classify mixed-defect wafer maps. The proposed method utilizes three components to generate synthetic wafer maps from the training dataset: mixup, random rotation, and noise filtering. Mixup combines single-defect wafer maps to create synthetic mixed-defect wafer maps. Random rotation increases the diversity of the synthetic wafer maps. Noise filtering prevents the accumulation of random noise in synthetic wafer maps. The CNN is trained with the synthetic wafer maps generated through the proposed method, which include normal, single-defect, and mixed-defect variations. Through experimental investigation using the MixedWM38 dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods.

AB We investigate whether including the text-based communicative value of annual report increases the predictive power of four machine learning models (Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine) for corporate bankruptcy prediction using U.S. firm observations from 1994 to 2018. We find that the overall prediction effectiveness of these four models (e.g. accuracy, F1-score, AUCs) significantly improves, especially true in the performance of XGBoost and Random Forest models. In addition, we find that annual report text-based communicative value variables significantly reduce models' Type II error and keep the Type I error at a relatively small level, especially for the short-term bankruptcy forecast. The results reveal that annual report text-based communicative value effectively mitigates the model misidentification of a non-bankrupt firm as a bankrupt firm. Our results also suggest that annual report text-based communicative value is helpful for bank's corporate loan underwriting decisions. Finally, our findings still hold when considering different testing periods and random state settings, replacing by another publicly available bankruptcy dataset, and introducing neural network models.

AB With the development of financial market, people invest their savings into different financial products to increase return. However, financial market is an extremely complex system, where investment opportunities and risk often coexist. For investors, it is necessary to take effective measures to avoid risk while obtaining considerable return. In recent decades, actively managing investment in the form of a portfolio is widely accepted by investors. In this paper, we propose a new three-objective Sortino ratio-expected shortfall-turnover rate (SR-ES-TR) portfolio optimization (PO) model. The Sortino ratio is used to measure the risk-adjusted rate of return. The expected shortfall is used to measure the tail risk of a portfolio. Portfolio liquidity risk is characterized by turnover rate. We constructed a portfolio of ten stocks and solved the SR-ES-TR model by the novel MOPSO-SODE algorithm. Compared with other four multi-objective algorithms, the better performance and validity in solving SR-ES-TR model by MOPSO-SODE algorithm have been verified.

AB In several businesses, forecasting is needed to predict expenses, future revenue, and profit margin. As such, accurate forecasting is pivotal to the success of those businesses. Due to the effects of different exogenous factors, such as economic fluctuations, and weather conditions, time series is susceptible to nonlinearity and complexity, making accurate predictions difficult. This work proposes a machine-learning-based time series forecasting technique to improve the precision and computation performance of an induced time series forecasting model. The proposed technique, a multi-population particle swarm optimization-based nonlinear time series predictive model, decomposes a predictive task into three sub-tasks: observation window optimization, predictive model induction task, and forecasting horizon prediction. Each sub-task is optimized by a particle swarm optimization sub-swarm in which the sub-swarms are executed in parallel. The proposed technique was experimentally evaluated on fifteen Electric load time series using root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and computation time as performance measures. The results obtained show that the proposed technique was effective to induce a forecasting model of improved predictive and computation performance to outperform the bench-mark techniques on all datasets. Also, the proposed algorithm was competitive with state-of-the-art techniques. The future direction of this work will consider an empirical analysis of the search and solution spaces of the proposed technique and perform a fitness landscape analysis.

AB Distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problems (DPFSP) have become research hotspots. However, a DPFSP with tardiness and rejection costs (DPTR), which has important practical significance, has not yet been addressed. As manufacturers are most concerned about the maximization of the total profit, this study addresses the DPFSP to maximize the total profit. A mixed-integer linear programming model is used to describe the DPTR. An iterated greedy algorithm named IG_TR is proposed. IG_TR generates initial solutions using an improved NEH heuristic using four rules based on the deadline, due date, tardiness and rejection costs. For IG_TR, a dynamic number of jobs are removed from factories in the destruction phase. In the reconstruction phase, the removed jobs and those waiting to be processed are selected to be inserted into appropriate positions in the factories. Two local search methods are designed to improve the quality of solutions generated in the reconstruction phase. During the acceptance phase, a restart mechanism is proposed to avoid falling into local optimal. The experimental results of the component analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of IG_TR. Several comprehensive experiments show that IG_TR outperforms five related algorithms.

The proposed model considers the changes of fluctuating sequences like cross-sequences both in domain time and between time intervals. To obtain the quantitative change about sequences, relative angle change is employed to determine the variation in each interval, and the relative angle oscillation change is utilized for measuring variations between intervals. To find the optimal time lag or time intervals, the corresponding cycles are extracted by time-delay models. The reliability of the proposed models will be verified through cases in identifying crucial factors for air quality, and the final detection will then be made. To compare with existing representative GRA models clearly, the relation between two fluctuating sequences shaped in cross-sequences is examined by the proposed model. The empirical results show that the relation degree between pollutants and air quality is reasonable. The compared experiment shows that the GRA for cross-sequences can effectively identify the relationship among fluctuating sequences and the impact of timedelay is small for the proposed model with similar shapes.

AB The identification of critical nodes is a crucial aspect in studying the spread of diseases, vaccination strategies, power grid robustness, advertisement placement, and rumor control. Consequently, this topic has become of immense interest in recent times. In the last decade, numerous methods have been proposed for identifying critical nodes, but each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, which can be attributed to the complex nature of networks and different scenarios. Therefore, it is unlikely that a single method can be applicable to all networks. To address the need for improved critical node identification in propagation scenarios, we propose a new approach called IDME (Information Diffusion and Matthew Effect aggregation). This approach is inspired by the real-world phenomenon of information diffusion and the Matthew effect. IDME simulates the dissemination of information in the real world and obtains information from multilayer neighbors, which is then aggregated using the Matthew effect. By considering its own information as well as that of its multilayer neighbors, IDME can more accurately identify critical nodes in networks while maintaining low time complexity. Experimental results on numerous real-world networks demonstrate that the IDME approach is effective in detecting critical nodes in networks and outperforms representative algorithms on most networks.

The conditions required by the theorem are less conservative, and fairly accurate settling time (ST) estimation is given under the condition that the derivative of Lyapunov- Krasovskii function is not always less than 0. Then, by using Power-Mean inequality and other inequality techniques, the controller is designed to make the system stable. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show that our results improve the previous ones.

AB In this research, an attempt has been made to build a bridge between a machine learning model called Least-Squares Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) and Weighted Residual Methods (WRMs) to solve delay differential equations in fractional derivative order. Our machine learning algorithm, which is influenced by the collocation method, uses Legendre polynomials as a kernel function to approximate the solution of linear and nonlinear delay differential equations, including the Lane-Emden pantograph equation and some fractional cases. In the proposed algorithm, the estimated solution of delay differential equations is approximated as a linear combination of M degrees of Legendre polynomials and a set of weights that are learned during the fitting process. The roots of the Legendre functions are utilized as training data to develop the algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the use of numerical graphs and tables. A comparative analysis of the numerical results has shown that the proposed method yields better accuracy and convergence compared to other numerical techniques.

AB Accurate carbon price prediction is conducive to the stable operation and development of carbon financial markets. Affected by major policies and economies, the laws of carbon price may show huge changes, generating various breakpoints that hinder the prediction work. Therefore, a hybrid model based on adaptive segmentation and feature clustering is developed to forecast carbon price, which responds to the growing requirement of the high precision prediction. It solves the issue that the accuracy and stability of model are limited by the breakpoint via the adaptive processing and the fully learning for data. Meanwhile, the proposed adaptive structure improves the robustness and adaptability of prediction model, achieving accurate prediction for carbon emission trading markets with different features. The eight carbon emission trading markets in China are used to evaluate prediction performance. The obtained results indicated that the proposed model was effective and robust, with the average mean absolute error and root mean square error of only 0.2272 and 0.3321, respectively. According to the comparative analysis, the segmentation based on breakpoint and adaptive prediction based on feature clustering improve the model forecasting accuracy by 69.87% and 45.51%, respectively. Hence, the proposed model can meet the requirements of carbon financial markets and provide a benchmark for the carbon emission reduction work.

AB Ease of flexibility, convenience, and smartness have made the Internet of Things (IoT) the industry, and user favorite device has recently piqued the industry's interest. With the widespread use of this technology, an unprecedented number of IoT endpoints, including devices in our homes, are now connected to external networks. Firmware of this type is typically heterogeneous and closed source. At the firmware level, it is harder to detect and evaluate security vulnerabilities since their effects are faster and larger. In recent years, several similaritybased firmware security detection techniques and tools have become research hotspots. Security concerns and attacks have risen to the top of the list for IoT security equipment, particularly IoT cameras. Firmware has historically been one of the most neglected areas of device security, leaving it exposed to malicious actors. This research proposes a unique twelve-step process to perform firmware analysis and security assessment of Smart IoT-based Camera devices.

AB In this paper, two different parallel approaches for a hybrid fractional order Coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model are presented. Both parallel approaches are implemented using Julia high level language. Parallel algorithm implementations are developed for the HPC cluster using Message Passing Interface (MPI) technology and general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) based on hardware environments. The algorithm implementation are used to solve the real-world problem of the hybrid fractional order Coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model and to study the parallel efficiency. The introduced hybrid fractional order derivative is defined as a linear combination of the integral of Riemann-Liouville and the fractional order Caputo derivative. A parallel algorithm is designed based on the predictor-corrector method with the discretization of the Caputo proportional constant fractional hybrid operator for solving the model problem numerically. Simulation results show that, both the new parallel approaches achieve significant efficiency.

AB The classification problem of imbalanced data is a research focus in machine learning. An effective method for solving the class-imbalance problem is to generate synthetic samples for minority class data. Popular methods for synthesize samples include SMOTE, variants of SMOTE, and oversampling methods applying metaheuristic algorithms. Recently, an oversampling method DEBOHID based on differential evolutionary algorithm has been proposed. It uses nearest neighbors of the minority class to synthesize samples for balancing the data set. However, samples synthesized by nearest neighbors are easily interfered by noisy samples. Therefore, we proposed an oversampling method based on natural neighbors, called NaN-DEBOHID. In NaN-DEBOHID, minority samples are divided into dense samples and outliers according to the number of natural neighbors. Samples of different types are processed by different methods. The main advantages of NaN-DEBOHID are concluded as follows: (a) it finds samples that better represent the minority class distribution by applying natural neighbors; (b) it creates synthetic samples that showed better consistency with the surrounding samples by the DEBOHID method; (c) it removes noise samples of the minority class to enhance the classification performance. For experiments, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) are used as classifiers. The results indicated that NaN-DEBOHID performed competitively in terms of Accuracy, F-measure and AUC.

AB This paper investigates runtime monitoring of perception systems. Perception is a critical component of high-integrity applications of robotics and autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars. In these applications, failure of perception systems may put human life at risk, and a broad adoption of these technologies requires the development of methodologies to guarantee and monitor safe operation. Despite the paramount importance of perception, currently there is no formal approach for system-level perception monitoring. In this paper, we formalize the problem of runtime fault detection and identification in perception systems and present a framework to model diagnostic information using a diagnostic graph. We then provide a set of deterministic, probabilistic, and learning-based algorithms that use diagnostic graphs to perform fault detection and identification. Moreover, we investigate fundamental limits and provide deterministic and probabilistic guarantees on the fault detection and identification results. We conclude the paper with an extensive experimental evaluation, which recreates several realistic failure modes in the LGSVL open-source autonomous driving simulator, and applies the proposed system monitors to a state-of-the-art autonomous driving software stack (Baidu's Apollo Auto). The results show that the proposed system monitors outperform baselines, have the potential of preventing accidents in realistic autonomous driving scenarios, and incur a negligible computational overhead.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION
AB As Deep Neural Networks (DNN) make their way into safety-critical decision processes, it becomes imperative to have robust and reliable uncertainty estimates for their predictions for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. This is particularly important in real-life high-risk settings such as healthcare, where OOD examples (e.g., patients with previously unseen or rare labels, i.e., diagnoses) are frequent, and an incorrect clinical decision might put human life in danger, in addition to having severe ethical and financial costs. While evidential uncertainty estimates for deep learning have been studied for multi-class problems, research in multi-label settings remains untapped. In this paper, we propose a DEep Evidential Doctor (DEED), which is a novel deterministic approach to estimate multi-label targets along with uncertainty. We achieve this by placing evidential priors over the original likelihood functions and directly estimating the parameters of the evidential distribution using a novel loss function. Additionally, we build a redundancy layer (particularly for high uncertainty and OOD examples) to minimize the risk associated with erroneous decisions based on dubious predictions. We achieve this by learning the mapping between the evidential space and a continuous semantic label embedding space via a recurrent decoder. Thereby inferring, even in the case of OOD examples, reasonably close predictions to avoid catastrophic consequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DEED on a digit classification task based on a modified multi-label MNIST dataset, and further evaluate it on a diagnosis prediction task from a real-life electronic health record dataset. We highlight that in terms of prediction scores, our approach is on par with the existing state-of-the-art having a clear advantage of generating reliable, memory and time efficient uncertainty estimates with minimal changes to any multi-label DNN classifier.

AB This paper studies the problem of risk-averse receding horizon motion planning for agents with uncertain dynamics, in the presence of stochastic, dynamic obstacles. We propose a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that formulates the obstacle avoidance constraint using coherent risk measures. To handle disturbances, or process noise, in the state dynamics, the state constraints are tightened in a risk-aware manner to provide a disturbance feedback policy. We also propose a waypoint following algorithm that uses the proposed MPC scheme for discrete distributions and prove its risk-sensitive recursive feasibility while guaranteeing finite-time task completion. We further investigate some commonly used coherent risk metrics, namely, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), entropic value-at-risk (EVaR), and g-entropic risk measures, and propose a tractable incorporation within MPC. We illustrate our framework via simulation studies.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Performance analysis of optimized versatile video coding software
   decoders on embedded platforms
SO JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, the global demand for high-resolution videos and the emergence of new multimedia applications have created the need for a new video coding standard. Therefore, in July 2020, the versatile video coding (VVC) standard was released, providing up to 50% bit-rate savings for the same video quality compared to its predecessor high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). However, these bit-rate savings come at the cost of high computational complexity, particularly for live applications and on resource-constrained embedded devices. This paper evaluates two optimized VVC software decoders, named OpenVVC and Versatile Video deCoder (VVdeC), designed for low resources platforms. These decoders exploit optimization techniques such as data-level parallelism using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and functional-level parallelism using frame, tile, and slice-based parallelisms. Furthermore, a comparison of decoding runtime, energy, and memory consumption between the two decoders is presented while targeting two different resource-constraint embedded devices. The results showed that both decoders achieve real-time decoding of full high-definition (FHD) resolution on the first platform using 8 cores and high-definition (HD) real-time decoding for the second platform using only 4 cores with comparable results in terms of the average energy consumed: around 26 J and 15 J for the 8 cores and 4 cores platforms, respectively. Furthermore, OpenVVC showed better results regarding memory usage with a lower average maximum memory consumed during runtime than VVdeC.

AB In high energy physics, one of the most important processes for collider data analysis is the comparison of collected and simulated data. Nowadays the state-of-the-art for data generation is in the form of Monte Carlo (MC) generators. However, because of the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there will not be enough computational power or time to match the amount of needed simulated data using MC methods. An alternative approach under study is the usage of machine learning generative methods to fulfill that task. Since the most common final-state objects of high-energy proton collisions are hadronic jets, which are collections of particles collimated in a given region of space, this work aims to develop a convolutional variational autoencoder (ConVAE) for the generation of particle-based LHC hadronic jets. Given the ConVAE's limitations, a normalizing flow (NF) network is coupled to it in a two-step training process, which shows improvements on the results for the generated jets. The ConVAE+NF network is capable of generating a jet in 18.30 +/- 0.04 mu s , making it one of the fastest methods for this task up to now.

AB Video streams are utilised to guide minimally-invasive surgery and diagnosis in a wide range of procedures, and many computer-assisted techniques have been developed to automatically analyse them. These approaches can provide additional information to the surgeon such as lesion detection, instrument navigation, or anatomy 3D shape modelling. However, the necessary image features to recognise these patterns are not always reliably detected due to the presence of irregular light patterns such as specular highlight reflections. In this paper, we aim at removing specular highlights from endoscopic videos using machine learning. We propose using temporal generative adversarial network (GAN) to inpaint the hidden anatomy under specularities, inferring its appearance spatially and from neighbouring frames, where they are not present in the same location. This is achieved using in-vivo data from gastric endoscopy (Hyper Kvasir) in a fully unsupervised manner that relies on the automatic detection of specular highlights. System evaluations show significant improvements to other methods through direct comparison and ablation studies that depict the importance of the network's temporal and transfer learning components. The generalisability of our system to different surgical setups and procedures was also evaluated qualitatively on in-vivo data of gastric endoscopy and ex-vivo porcine data (SERV-CT, SCARED). We also assess the effect of our method in comparison to other methods on computer vision tasks that underpin 3D reconstruction and camera motion estimation, namely stereo disparity, optical flow, and sparse point feature matching. These are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and results show a positive effect of our specular inpainting method on these tasks in a novel comprehensive analysis. Our code and dataset are made available at https://github.com/endomapper/Endo-STTN.

AB Image classification, which is a fundamental element of Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been researched intensively in numerous domains and embedded in many products. However, with the exponential increase in the number of images and the complexity of the required tasks, deep-learning classifica-tion algorithms demand more intensive resources and computational power to train the models and update the massive number of parameters. Quantum computing is a new research technology with a promising capability of exponential speed up and operational parallelization with its unique phenomena including superposition and entanglement. Researchers have already started utilizing Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in image classification. Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive published literature review on quantum image classification. Therefore, this paper analyzes the advances in this field by dividing the studies based on a unique taxonomy, discussing the limitations, summarizing essential aspects of each research, and finally, emphasizing the gaps, challenges, and recommendations. One of the key challenges presented in the paper is that quantum computers are in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where they contain a limited number of noisy qubits, therefore challenging complex quantum classifiers and complex images from advanced datasets. This research recommends constructing a novel quantum image encoding method that adapts to the available number of qubits and enables RGB images as a critical contribution to the existing research.

TI Memory capacity of recurrent neural networks with matrix representation

DT Article
DE Recurrent neural networks; Representation learning; Memory networks;
   Memory capacity
AB It is well known that canonical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) face limitations in learning long-term dependencies, which have been addressed by memory structures in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Neural Turing machines (NTMs) are a variant of RNNs that implement the notion of programmable memory with neural network controllers that can learn simple algorithmic tasks. Matrix neural networks, on the other hand, feature matrix representations which inherently has the potential to preserve the spatial structure of data when compared to canonical neural networks that use only vector-based representation. One may then argue that neural networks with matrix representations may have the potential to provide better memory capacity. In this paper, we define and study a probabilistic notion of memory capacity based on Fisher information for matrix-based RNNs. We find bounds on memory capacity for such networks under various hypotheses and compare them with their conventional (vector) counterparts. In particular, we show that the memory capacity of such networks is bounded by N-2, for N x N state matrix which generalizes and provides similar results for vector networks. We also show and analyze the increase in memory capacity for such networks which is introduced when one exhibits an external state memory, such as NTMs. Consequently, we construct NTMs with RNN controllers with matrix-based representation of external memory, leading us to introduce Matrix NTMs. We demonstrate the performance of this class of memory networks under certain algorithmic learning tasks such as copying and recall and compare it with Matrix RNNs. We find an improvement in the performance of Matrix NTMs by the addition of external memory, in comparison to Matrix RNNs.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread attention due to their unique bio-interpretability and low-power properties, but the non-differentiability of discrete spike sequences fired by spiking neurons brings difficulties to the learning of SNNs. Recently, surrogate gradient (SG) and back-propagation through time (BPTT) have provided an excellent idea for training SNNs constructed by leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron models. The LIF neuron model has been widely used in previous SNNs due to its simplicity and low computational cost, however, this also limits its simulation of biological neuron dynamics, reducing the biological interpretability of SNNs. In this paper, we generalize SG and BPTT to SNNs constructed by spike response model (SRM) and propose the BP-SRM algorithm. Specifically, we address why BPTT succeeded in LIF neurons-based SNNs but failed in SRM neurons-based SNNs in previous researches. Then we establish an iterative form of the SRM neuron model by selecting different state variables. Based on iterable SRM, we get the spatiotemporal dependencies between the state variables of SRM neurons-based SNNs, which allows us to derive the gradient and update weights in SNN by BP-SRM. Then we design temporal channel normalization for BP-SRM and verify the performance of the SNNs on static image dataset, dynamic image dataset and engineering dataset, including Fashion-MNIST, Weather Dataset, N-MNIST, American Sign Language Dataset and bearing fault diagnosis dataset. The experiment results indicate that BP-SRM achieves the state-of-the-art performance of SNNs.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; REDUCTION
AB In multi-label classification, the expansion of output dimension seriously interferes learning performance, and even fails to build a joint prediction model. In order to restrain the proliferation of multi-label classifier's hypothesis space, the current works focus on the application of global positive label correlation. However, the "black or white"mechanism ignore other possible forms of label correlation, such as negative or neutral correlation. By introducing the doctrine of the mean, three-way decision (3WD) theory provides a solution for in-depth research on local label correlation, and aims to handle the uncertainty of multi-label learning tasks. In this paper, a novel learning algorithm for multi-label joint classification, namely ML-3WD, is proposed by considering the 3WD label correlation from the perspective of samples. According to the weights of different features on any label, the comprehensive loss of each sample to three action strategies can be measured. Obviously, the 3WD rules for any label variable in multi-label output space is obtained. By aggregating the cutting thresholds between different labels, the division principles of 3WD label correlation are further established. Given any multi-label sample, the local fuzzy membership to co-occurrence or mutual state for label pair is examined based on kernelized fuzzy rough sets. The 3WD local label relevance of each sample is confirmed, that is, positive, negative or neutral. The global application strategy for multi-label classification is utilized to avoid over-fitting induced by local mining strategy. Based on the integral mean of the distribution of 3WD local label relevance in multi-label sample space, two different versions of empirical label relevance are constructed. By constraining the relative position between sub-separation hyperplanes, the 3WD label correlation distribution-based model for multi-label joint classification is designed. The experiment results on fifteen real world multi-label datasets reflect that our algorithm achieves good classification ability and versatility. The impact of core parameters on learning performance is also dissected.

DE Real-time fall detection; Improved spatial-temporal graph convolution;
   Edge computing; Pose estimation
AB Providing timely rescue when a fall occurs can greatly reduce fall mortality for older people. With the growing number of single-resided elders, real-time smart fall incident detection has become a new research hotspot. Accuracy, computational complexity and real-time response are key issues to be solved in this topic. A fall detection model that combines an improved Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with the BlazePose algorithm is proposed in this paper. The computational speed is improved by removing four redundant layers from the ST-GCN network. Meanwhile, an attention mechanism focussing on the key joints involved in the falling action and their correlation is applied in the model, which introduces an Effective SE Block (ESE Block) to the residual structure of ST-GCN. It is achieved by fusing the original features with channel attention weights obtained by global average pooling and fully connected operations for the joint features. The BlazePose algorithm of the mediapipe framework is used to recognise human targets and locate the spatial coordinates of specific joints. Then the spatiotemporal graph features of the human body are extracted by the improved ST-GCN from the temporal and spatial displacements of 30 consecutive frames. Furthermore, fall behaviour is judged by the action type defined by the spatiotemporal graph. The accuracy of the proposed model for public datasets, such as Le2i Fall, Multicam Fall and UR Fall, is 99.29%, 99.22% and 98.64% respectively, which are higher than the Alphapose + ST-GCN model by 9.04%, 20% and 25.2%. Such accuracy is even better than the existing best algorithms by 0.89%, 0.92% and 1.04%. When running on the i5-10200H CPU and the Jetson Nano edge computing device, the Alphapose + ST-GCN model achieves frame rates of 11.42fps and 1.5fps, whilst the frame rates of this paper are up to 24.5fps and 9.37fps. The experimental results fully show that based on BlazePose with the improved ST-GCN makes the fall detection model higher accuracy, faster speed, real-time performance and high compatibility with the Jetson Nano edge computing device.

AB Satellite range scheduling always plays a crucial role in tracking, telemetry, and control of the spacecraft. With the significant increase in the number and type of satellites in orbit, the demands of users for satellite range scheduling are becoming more and more diverse. However, existing studies for the satellite range scheduling problem (SRSP) rarely consider multiple optimization objectives, which is quite significant in practice. Hence, this paper investigates a multi-objective satellite range scheduling problem (MO-SRSP) that optimizes three objectives simultaneously: the overall profits of tasks, load-balance of antennas, and completion timeliness of tasks. To address MO-SRSP, this paper establishes a mathematical model on the basis of analysis of MO-SRSP and proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which is called multi-objective differential evolution algorithm based on space division and adaptive selection strategy (MODE-SDAS). The space division strategy will uniformly divide the objective space into a set of subspaces and preserve a set of non-dominated solutions in each subspace during the environmental selection even if some of these solutions are dominated by other solutions in other subspaces, so as to maintain the diversity of the algorithm. The adaptive selection strategy will adaptively allocate computational resources to different subspaces to improve the convergence of the population. Besides, problem-specific designs such as coding and encoding methods, the discrete differential evolution operator, as well as objective-specific individual variation operators are incorporated into the algorithm to enhance the search capability. Finally, extensive experiments based on simulation test cases are carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of MODE-SDAS. The comparison results show that MODE-SDAS significantly outperforms its competitors in terms of three metrics. Meanwhile, knee point analysis, sensitivity analysis, and application insights are presented.

AB Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an essential area of pervasive computing deployed in numerous fields. In order to seamlessly capture human activities, various inertial sensors embedded in wearable devices have been used to generate enormous amounts of signals, which are multidimensional time series of state changes. Therefore, the signals must be divided into windows for feature extraction. Deep learning (DL) methods have recently been used to automatically extract local and temporal features from signals obtained using wearable sensors. Likewise, multiple input deep learning architectures have been proposed to improve the quality of learned features in wearable sensor HAR. However, these architectures are often designed to extract local and temporal features on a single pipeline, which affects feature representation quality. Also, such models are always parameter-heavy due to the number of weights involved in the architecture. Since resources (CPU, battery, and memory) of end devices are limited, it is crucial to propose lightweight deep architectures for easy deployment of activity recognition models on end devices. To contribute, this paper presents a new deep parallel architecture named DLT, based on pipeline concatenation. Each pipeline consists of two sub-pipelines, where the first subpipeline learns local features in the current window using 1D-CNN, and the second sub-pipeline learns temporal features using Bi-LSTM and LSTMs before concatenating the feature maps and integrating channel attention. By doing this, the proposed DLT model fully harnessed the capabilities of CNN and RNN equally in capturing more discriminative features from wearable sensor signals while increasing responsiveness to essential features. Also, the size of the model is reduced by adding a lightweight module to the top of the architecture, thereby ensuring the proposed DLT architecture is lightweight. Experiments on two publicly available datasets showed that the proposed architecture achieved an accuracy of 98.52% on PAMAP2 and 97.90% on WISDM datasets, outperforming existing models with few model parameters.

AB Almost all existing distribution network grounding tests are online. The existing offline distribution network grounding detection methods are all manual handling methods, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive and cause damage to the environment. To save labor cost, reduce environmental damage, and improve detection efficiency and accuracy, this study designs an offline grounding detection device for distribution networks and proposes a DResInceptionNasNet method for grounding detection. The DResInceptionNasNet network, which is trained offline, can predict the location of distribution network grounding wire presence offline and accurately. In this study, the DResInceptionNasNet network is experimented in IEEE 9 and IEEE 39 systems. The obtained experimental results verify that the DResInceptionNasNet network has an average accuracy of at least 2.93 % higher than other 17 network models such as ResNet, NasNet, and Inception V3. In addition, the developed distribution network offline detection device and the proposed DResInceptionNasNet network can effectively and accurately detect the grounding location of distribution networks.

AB Diseases caused by invasive pathogens are an increasing threat to forest health, and early and accurate disease detection is essential for timely and precision forest management. The recent technological advancements in spectral imaging and artificial intelligence have opened up new possibilities for plant disease detection in both crops and trees. In this study, Dutch elm disease (DED; caused by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi,) and American elm (Ulmus americana) was used as example pathosystem to evaluate the accuracy of two in-house developed high-precision portable hyper- and multi-spectral leaf imagers combined with machine learning as new tools for forest disease detection. Hyper- and multi-spectral images were collected from leaves of American elm genotypes with varied disease susceptibilities after mock-inoculation and inoculation with O. novo-ulmi under greenhouse conditions. Both traditional machine learning and state-of-art deep learning models were built upon derived spectra and directly upon spectral image cubes. Deep learning models that incorporate both spectral and spatial features of high-resolution spectral leaf images have better performance than traditional machine learning models built upon spectral features alone in detecting DED. Edges and symptomatic spots on the leaves were highlighted in the deep learning model as important spatial features to distinguish leaves from inoculated and mock-inoculated trees. In addition, spectral and spatial feature patterns identified in the machine learningbased models were found relative to the DED susceptibility of elm genotypes. Though further studies are needed to assess applications in other pathosystems, hyper- and multi-spectral leaf imagers combined with machine learning show potential as new tools for disease phenotyping in trees.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB To ensure sustainability in agriculture, many optimization problems need to be solved. An important one of them is harvest scheduling problem. In this study, the harvest scheduling problem for the tea is discussed. The tea harvest problem includes the creating a harvest schedule by considering the farmers' quotas under the purchase location and factory capacity. Tea harvesting is carried out in cooperation with the farmer -factory. Factory management is interested in using its resources. So, the factory capacity, purchase location capacities and number of expeditions should be considered during the harvesting process. When the farmer's side is examined, it is seen that the real professions of farmers are different. On harvest days, farmers often cannot attend to their primary professions. Considering the harvest day preferences of farmers in creating the harvest schedule are of great importance for sustainability in agriculture. Two different mathematical models are proposed to solve this problem. The first model minimizes the number of weekly expeditions of factory vehicles within the factor and purchase location capacity restrictions. The second model minimizes the number of expeditions and aims to comply with the preferences of the farmers as much as possible. A sample application was performed in a region with 12 purchase locations, 988 farmers, and 3392 decares of tea fields. The results show that the compliance rate of farmers to harvesting preferences could be increased from 52% to 97%, and this situation did not affect the number of expeditions of the factory. This result shows that considering the farmers' preferences on the harvest day will have no negative impact on the factory. On the contrary, it was concluded that this situation increases sustainability and encouragement in agriculture. Furthermore, the results show that models are effective for solving the problem.(c) 2023 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.

AB Differential evolution (DE) is a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm for global numerical optimization, which has been used in a wide range of application fields. The parameter of population size usually has important influence on the performance of DE, but it is not widely studied in the scope of DE. Based on the relationship between the population size and the exploration/exploitation ability of DE, we propose a novel fluctuant population (FP) strategy for automatically adjusting the value of population size during the runs. More specifically, the FP strategy mainly contains three parts: a monotone decreasing function is used to coordinate the focus between the exploration ability and exploitation ability, which can cause the FP strategy to decrease progressively at the macro level; a periodic function is applied to control the population diversity, which leads to the fluctuant feature of FP strategy at micro level; a rearranging and auto-grouping operation is used for removing and adding individual when the population size is changed. To evaluate the effect of the fluctuant population strategy on DE algorithm, based on 30 benchmark functions, we compare six selected DE algorithms with and without the FP strategy. The simulation results show that the fluctuant population strategy can significantly improve the performance of the six DE algorithms.

AB The empty equipment repositioning (EER) problem is deemed an inefficiency of the marine industry. However, owing to trade imbalance as the fundamental cause of EER, such problem is inevitable and requires consideration in pricing decisions. Accordingly, this study explores a marine service chain with one carrier and two dominant forwarders providing transportation service between two ports. We built a mathematical model to examine how carrier and forwarders determine pricing decisions with and without EER cost sharing. We find that the smaller one between empty equipment balancing and EER costs determines pricing decisions. We also investigate whether the EER cost-sharing mechanism can coordinate the service chain and subsequently found that the EER cost-sharing mechanism aggravates double marginalization. Then, we design a two-part tariff coordination mechanism to coordinate the service chain. Lastly, we study the effect of EER cost sharing and coordination mechanism on the environment. Interestingly, we find that EER cost-sharing and coordination should be avoided from the perspective of environmental protection.

AB Bayesian experimental design is a technique that allows to efficiently select measurements to characterize a physical system by maximizing the expected information gain. Recent developments in deep neural networks and normalizing flows allow for a more efficient approximation of the posterior and thus the extension of this technique to complex high-dimensional situations. In this paper, we show how this approach holds promise for adaptive measurement strategies to characterize present-day quantum technology platforms. In particular, we focus on arrays of coupled cavities and qubit arrays. Both represent model systems of high relevance for modern applications, like quantum simulations and computing, and both have been realized in platforms where measurement and control can be exploited to characterize and counteract unavoidable disorder. Thus, they represent ideal targets for applications of Bayesian experimental design.

SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS

DE Generative adversarial networks; Federated learning; Backdoor attack

AB Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research and augment medical datasets. Training generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping raw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training data. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and centralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor attacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in the FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor attacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently determined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the poisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further contaminates other clients when averaging the generator's parameters and yields high generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and effective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which allows the server to detect the client's adversarial behavior based on their losses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two medical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on FedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity. After detecting and suppressing the detected malicious clients using the proposed defense strategy, we show that FedGANs can synthesize high-quality medical datasets (with labels) for data augmentation to improve classification models' performance.

Firstly, we consider two types of coupled neural networks with multi-weights. Subsequently, we formulate H-infinity synchronization criteria using inequality techniques and Lyapunov functional. Furthermore, we address the H-infinity synchronization problem for these two networks by employing node-/edge-based adaptive PI controllers. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results through numerical examples.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGY
AB Turning heavy and high-dimensional raw data into knowledge for decision makers is a complex process. Feature selection (FS) can do this task well by removing irrelevant and/or redundant parts from the raw dataset, aiming at reducing dimensionality and improving accuracy. In this work, a reinforcement learning-based comprehensive learning grey wolf optimizer (RLCGWO) is designed to solve the FS problem, which is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. First, a comprehensive learning operator is proposed, containing the static and dynamic learning strategies. These two strategies provide GWO with the exploration capability in different ways. Second, a novel RL-based policy regulation technique is developed, which is based on the Q-learning framework. Individuals are considered as agents that obtain the state of the environment based on the state encoding technique. Meanwhile, agents select the most appropriate actions from the well-designed action set based on the information provided by the Q-table. Furthermore, agents update the stand-alone Q-table with rewards to provide themselves with more timely and accurate feedback. Third, a chaotic-based learning strategy is devised for leaders to improve the quality of the optimal solution. The comparison results of the proposed RLCGWO with six successful GWO variants and three typical algorithms on the benchmarks initially demonstrate its advantages in convergence speed and accuracy. The proposed RLCGWO is finally applied to the challenging FS problem. The comparison results with six popular algorithms on 15 UCI datasets and 3 real world high-dimensional datasets underscore its high adaptability and versatility. Taken together, the proposed RLCGWO is a promising technique for FS.

AB Clustering and the feedback mechanism in a consensus reaching process (CRP) have been regarded as two critical components when solving the large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problem. However, the necessity of treating decision makers (DMs) as a dynamic social network (in terms of their trust relationships) in the DM clustering has not been fully investigated. Also, with people's increased democratic awareness, it appears essential to consider the individual's willingness to cooperate when designing the feedback mechanism in the CRP. This study will focus on solving the LSGDM problem considering dynamic social networks and propose a novel two-stage consensus model. First, a hybrid trust network is built to dynamically represent social relationships among DMs (i.e., the hybrid trust network evolves with the CRP). Spectral clustering algorithm is then used to cluster DMs into more trusted sub-groups, thus improving the efficiency of coordinating DMs. Second, a two-stage feedback mechanism is designed to help DMs reach a consensus in a more human-centric manner. To reach a consensus without seriously violating the willingness of DMs, we strike a balance between maximizing the consensus degree and minimizing the adjustment cost and further develop two nonlinear programming models to provide modification suggestions for sub-groups and individuals, respectively. The originality of the proposed consensus model can be summarized as clustering the dynamic hybrid trust network integrated with balancing the decision-making efficiency against the willingness of DMs to cooperate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed model are demonstrated through the detailed application study.

AB Multi-label classification is a fast-growing field of machine learning. Recent developments have shown several applications, including social media, healthcare, bio-molecular analysis, scene, and music classification associated with the multilabel classification. In classification problems, multiple labels (multilabel or more than one class label) are assigned to an unseen record instead of a single-label class assignment. Feature selection is a preprocessing phase used to identify the most relevant features that could improve the accuracy of the multilabel classifiers. The focus of this study is the feature selection method in multilabel classification. The study used a feature selection filter method involving the Fisher score, analysis of variance test, mutual information, Chi-Square, and ensembles of these statistical methods. An extensive range of machine learning algorithms is applied in the modelling phase of a multilabel classification model that includes binary relevance, classifier chain, label powerset, binary relevance KNN, multi-label twin support vector machine, multi-label KNN. Besides, label space partitioning and majority voting of ensemble methods are used and Random Forest is the base learner. The experiments are carried out over five different multilabel benchmarking datasets. The evaluation of the classification model is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and hamming loss. The study demonstrated that the filter methods (i.e. mutual information) having top weighted 80% to 20% features provided significant outcomes.

ID IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION
AB Crops grown on aquaponics farms are susceptible to various diseases or biotic stresses during their growth cycle, just like traditional agriculture. The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease identification system that determines the crop's health status. The final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of the three phases, reaching 95.83%, 94.13%, and 82.13%, respectively. The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease management.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Geometric semantic genetic programming (GSGP) is a popular form of GP where the effect of crossover and mutation can be expressed as geometric operations on a semantic space. A recent study showed that GSGP can be hybridized with a standard gradient-based optimized, Adam, commonly used in training artificial neural networks.We expand upon that work by considering more gradient-based optimizers, a deeper investigation of their parameters, how the hybridization is performed, and a more comprehensive set of benchmark problems. With the correct choice of hyperparameters, this hybridization improves the performances of GSGP and allows it to reach the same fitness values with fewer fitness evaluations.

AB This paper addresses the finite-time formation-containment control problem for multiple Euler-Lagrange systems with actuator faults and input saturations subject to external disturbances and nonlinear uncertainties under directed communication interactions. Systematic procedures on how to synthesize a distributed control scheme are developed based on adaptive backstepping control, fault-tolerant control, dynamic gain control and finite-time control such that leaders form a desired geometric configuration while tracking the virtual leader, and followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders during a finite-time period with sufficient accuracy. Two auxiliary systems are constructed to facilitate the control scheme design. Finite-time convergence and ease of computation burden in the sense of not using fractional powers of cooperative error information are realized by integrating dynamic gain control, finite-time control and one auxiliary system. Actuator faults, control input saturations, external disturbances and nonlinear uncertainties are coupled together and dealt with by adaptive backstepping control, fault-tolerant control and the other auxiliary system. In the end, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified with simulation results.

AB Pedestrian attribute retrieval (PAR) aims at retrieving soft-biometric attributes of pedestrian images from video surveillance. Despite advancements, PAR grapples with challenges, notably the concern of attribute imbalanced distribution. Within this context, we highlight a critical observation: this challenge encompasses both inter-attribute and overlooked intra-attribute imbalanced data distribution. To address the overlooked intra-attribute imbalance problem, we introduce an attribute-wise reasoning reinforcement learning framework (AwRL). AwRL formulates PAR as a Markov decision process (MDP), orchestrating attribute retrieval individually within reinforcement learning episodes. By traversing the entire PAR dataset, each attribute retrieval is calibrated with distinct reward scales, thereby ameliorating the intra-attribute imbalance. Additionally, we develop a novel supervised reinforcement loss function (SR-Loss) to enhance the robustness of the retrieval model. SR-Loss mitigates reinforcement learning's inherent training instability in the trial-and-error interactions with the environment. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets of PETA, RAP and PA100K demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, underscoring its capacity to surmount the intra-attribute imbalanced problem.

AB Errors in measurements are key to weighting the value of data, but are often neglected in machine learning (ML). We show how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to learn about the context and patterns of signal and noise, leading to improvements in the performance of classification methods. We construct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian distribution, and where the features (the input data) have varying, but known, levels of noise-in other words, each data point has a different error bar. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, such as those from astrophysical surveys, where noise arises as a realization of random processes with known underlying distributions. The classification of these objects can then be performed using standard statistical techniques (e.g. least squares minimization), as well as ML techniques. This allows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object classification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are incorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that, when each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e. noises with different distribution functions, which is typically the case in scientific data sets), that information can be learned by the CNNs, raising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least squares method-and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with varying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy for the underlying cumulative distribution function, but only if the information about specific input data uncertainties is provided to the CNNs.

AB Semantic segmentation consists of classifying each pixel of an image and constitutes an essential step towards scene recognition and understanding. Deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural networks now constitute state-of-the-art methods in the field of semantic segmentation. The problem of street scenes' segmentation for automotive applications constitutes an important application field of such networks and introduces a set of imperative exigencies. Since the models need to be executed on self-driving vehicles to make fast decisions in response to a constantly changing environment, they are not only expected to operate reliably but also to process the input images rapidly. In this paper, we explore genetic programming (GP) as a meta-model that combines four different efficiency-oriented networks for the analysis of urban scenes. Notably, we present and examine two approaches. In the first approach, we represent solutions as GP trees that combine networks' outputs such that each output class's prediction is obtained through the same meta-model. In the second approach, we propose representing solutions as lists of GP trees, each designed to provide a unique meta-model for a given target class. The main objective is to develop efficient and accurate combination models that could be easily interpreted, therefore allowing gathering some hints on how to improve the existing networks. The experiments performed on the Cityscapes dataset of urban scene images with semantic pixel-wise annotations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, our best-performing models improve systems' generalization ability by approximately 5% compared to traditional ensembles, 30% for the less performing state-of-the-art CNN and show competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art ensembles. Additionally, they are small in size, allow interpretability, and use fewer features due to GP's automatic feature selection.

AB The Transformation-Interaction-Rational is a representation for symbolic regression that limits the search space of functions to the ratio of two nonlinear functions each one defined as the linear regression of transformed variables. This representation has the main objective to bias the search towards simpler expressions while keeping the approximation power of standard approaches. The performance of using Genetic Programming with this representation was substantially better than with its predecessor (Interaction-Transformation) and ranked close to the state-of-the-art on a contemporary Symbolic Regression benchmark. On a closer look at these results, we observed that the performance could be further improved with an additional selective pressure for smaller expressions when the dataset contains just a few data points. The introduction of a penalization term applied to the fitness measure improved the results on these smaller datasets. One problem with this approach is that it introduces two additional hyperparameters: (i) a criterion for when the penalization should be activated and, (ii) the amount of penalization to the fitness function. One possible solution to alleviate this additional burden of correctly setting these hyperparameters is to pose the search as a multi-objective optimization problem by minimizing the approximation error and the expression size. The main idea is that the selective pressure of finding non-dominating solutions will return the simplest model for each particular approximation error in the pareto front. In this paper, we extend Transformation-Interaction-Rational to support multi-objective optimization, specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, and apply that to the same benchmark. A detailed analysis of the results show that the use of multi-objective optimization benefits the overall performance on a subset of the benchmarks while keeping the results similar to the single-objective approach on the remainder of the datasets. Specifically to the small datasets, we observe a small (and statistically insignificant) improvement of the results suggesting that further strategies must be explored.

AB The authors propose a complete software and hardware framework for a novel spherical robot to cope with exploration in harsh and unknown environments. The proposed robot is driven by a heavy pendulum covered by a fully enclosed spherical shell, which is strongly protected, amphibious, anti-overturn and has a long-battery-life. Algorithms for location and perception, planning and motion control are comprehensively designed. On the one hand, the authors fully consider the kinematic model of a spherical robot, propose a positioning algorithm that fuses data from inertial measurement units, motor encoder and Global Navigation Satellite System, improve global path planning algorithm based on Hybrid A* and design an instruction planning controller based on model predictive control (MPC). On the other hand, the dynamic model is built, linear MPC and robust servo linear quadratic regulator algorithm is improved, and a speed controller and a direction controller are designed. In addition, based on the pose and motion characteristics of a spherical robot, a visual obstacle perception algorithm and an electronic image stabilisation algorithm are designed. Finally, the authors build physical systems to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithms through experiments.

AB In this paper, under the framework of Filippov solutions, quasi-synchronization issue of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks (FCNNs) with discontinuous activations and uncertainties is investigated. Firstly, using Laplace transform and the property of Mittag-Leffler function, a novel fractional differential inequality is derived. Then combining the newly constructed inequality with delay feedback control scheme, several quasi-synchronization conditions are obtained for the considered FCNNs by means of non-decomposable method. Eventually, a numerical example is provided to substantiate validation of the proposed results.

AB This paper has investigated the fixed/predefined-time synchronization problem of delayed memristive neural networks(DNNs). Firstly, two novel controllers with state variable index coefficient are presented for achieving fixed-time synchronization of driver-response systems. Then, one effective control scheme is proposed out to realize predefined-time synchronization based on the results of fixed-time synchronization. Meanwhile, some conditions are given to direct how to select suitable controllers' parameters by employing fixed-time and Lyapunov theory. The established control schemes are shown to have simpler structures and may need lower energy. In addition, the settling time of fixed time synchronization has been estimated independently on initial states while predefined-time can be set by user in advance. At last, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the results.

DT Article
DE Representation learning; Role discovery; Heterogeneous network; Matrix

AB Since most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous, existing methods cannot characterize the roles of nodes in heterogeneous networks. The neighborhood structure of nodes in heterogeneous networks largely determines the node roles, and the basic statistical features of nodes describe the topology of nodes to some extent, so extracting structural features from the adjacency matrix of networks is crucial for role-oriented network representation learning(structural equivalence). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network representation learning model based on role feature extraction, called HRFE(Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning for Role Feature Extraction). Firstly, we perform feature extraction for each node in the heterogeneous network to obtain a high-dimensional feature matrix, then perform role discovery using non-negative matrix decomposition techniques to obtain a role-based node representation, and finally verify the effectiveness of the model HRFE through experiments on a large number of real datasets.

AB Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) pose a great challenge to maintaining the diversity of solutions. However, existing large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithms (MOEAs) prefer to directly use environmental selection methods designed for small-scale optimization problems. These methods are not effective in solving complex LSMOPs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-space (decision space and objective space) decomposition (TSD)-based diversity maintenance mechanism. Its main idea is to explicitly decompose the decision space and objective space into a number of subspaces, each of which may contain some Pareto-optimal solutions. Searching for Pareto-optimal solutions in these subspaces may help maintain the diversity of solutions. To this end, a diversity design subspace (DDS) is constructed to decompose the decision space. Then, a large-scale MOEA (MOEA/TSD) is designed by using the proposed TSD-based diversity maintenance mechanism. Experimental studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed TSD mechanism. Compared with nine state-of-the-art large-scale MOEAs on 112 benchmark LSMOPs, our proposed algorithm offers considerable advantages in overall optimization performance. The source code of MOEA/TSD is available at https://github.com/yizhizhede/MOEATSD.

AB Real-time image processing applications such as intelligent security and traffic management requires pattern recognition tasks, such face recognition, and license plate detection, to execute in mobile-embedded systems. These mobile-embedded applications employ the deep neural network (DNN), especially convolutional neural network (CNN), to complete the image classification. However, deploying CNN models on embedded platforms is challenging as memory-costly CNNs are in conflict with the highly limited memory budget. To address this challenge, a variety of CNN memory reduction methodologies have been proposed. Among these methodologies, CNN memory reuse has no influence on accuracy and throughput of CNN and is easy to realize, which is most suitable for embedded application. However, the existing memory reuse algorithms cannot achieve stable optimal solution. To solve the problem, we first improve an existing memory reuse algorithm. Compared with its original version, the improved algorithm provides 7-25% less memory consumption of intermediate results. We further propose a novel CNN memory reuse algorithm. In the new algorithm, we significantly make use of CNN structure to reuse memory and obtain optimal solution at most cases. Compared with two existing memory reuse algorithms, the new algorithm can reduce the memory footprint by an average of 20.3% and 9.4%.

AB Power line is an important part of the transmission line, is the only carrier of power transmission, so the detection of power lines is to ensure the stable operation of the power system is an important means. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of power line detection, this paper proposes a real-time power line segmentation method based on multi-attention mechanism and strong semantic feature extraction. The method is improved based on the DeepLab V3+ codec model. In the encoder part, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is firstly introduced in MobileNetV2 network, which strengthens the ability of contextual information interaction; the ASPPAttention fast feature fusion structure is proposed, which achieves the fast extraction of multi-dimensional effective information by designing the depth-separated convolution of different perceptual fields and strengthens the pixel-level feature encoding ability through the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism; in the decoder part, this paper proposes a real-time power line segmentation method based on multiple attention mechanisms and strong semantic feature extraction. In the decoder part, this paper proposes a real-time power line segmentation method based on multi-attention mechanism and strong semantic feature extraction. In the decoder part, a lightweight inverted convolutional decoder structure is proposed, which improves the feature extraction capability of the model by introducing an inverted bottleneck convolution structure in two quadruple downsampling layers with fewer parameters, and avoids heterogeneous splitting through the introduction of the CA attention mechanism; during the training process, the model convergence is accelerated through the migration of the VOC's training weights, and the model convergence is avoided through the introduction of the Dice Loss, the effect of the number of samples on the model to accelerate the model convergence speed. The loss avoids the effect of sample number on model generalisation. The experimental results show that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of this paper can reach 48.5%, the accuracy can reach 97.5%, and the detection speed of the model can reach 40.8 frames per second (fps), which is better than HRNet, PSPNet, DeepLab V3+ and other network models in the balance of speed and accuracy.

ID DEEP
AB In this note we present a fully information theoretic approach to renormalization inspired by Bayesian statistical inference, which we refer to as Bayesian renormalization. The main insight of Bayesian renormalization is that the Fisher metric defines a correlation length that plays the role of an emergent renormalization group (RG) scale quantifying the distinguishability between nearby points in the space of probability distributions. This RG scale can be interpreted as a proxy for the maximum number of unique observations that can be made about a given system during a statistical inference experiment. The role of the Bayesian renormalization scheme is subsequently to prepare an effective model for a given system up to a precision which is bounded by the aforementioned scale. In applications of Bayesian renormalization to physical systems, the emergent information theoretic scale is naturally identified with the maximum energy that can be probed by current experimental apparatus, and thus Bayesian renormalization coincides with ordinary renormalization. However, Bayesian renormalization is sufficiently general to apply even in circumstances in which an immediate physical scale is absent, and thus provides an ideal approach to renormalization in data science contexts. To this end, we provide insight into how the Bayesian renormalization scheme relates to existing methods for data compression and data generation such as the information bottleneck and the diffusion learning paradigm. We conclude by designing an explicit form of Bayesian renormalization inspired by Wilson's momentum shell renormalization scheme in quantum field theory. We apply this Bayesian renormalization scheme to a simple neural network and verify the sense in which it organizes the parameters of the model according to a hierarchy of information theoretic importance.

AB We present the first multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (BO) approach for solving inverse problems in the quantum control of prototypical quantum systems. Our approach automatically constructs time-dependent control fields that enable transitions between initial and desired final quantum states. Most importantly, our BO approach gives impressive performance in constructing time-dependent control fields, even for cases that are difficult to converge with existing gradient-based approaches. We provide detailed descriptions of our machine learning methods as well as performance metrics for a variety of machine learning algorithms. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BO is a promising approach to efficiently and autonomously design control fields in general quantum dynamical systems.

DE physics informed machine learning; Stokes flow; inverse problems;

AB We develop a probabilistic Stokes flow framework, using physics informed Gaussian processes, which can be used to solve both forward/inverse flow problems with missing and/or noisy data. The physics of the problem, specified by the Stokes and continuity equations, is exactly encoded into the inference framework. Crucially, this means that we do not need to explicitly solve the Poisson equation for the pressure field, as a physically meaningful (divergence-free) velocity field will automatically be selected. We test our method on a simple pressure driven flow problem, i.e. flow through a sinusoidal channel, and compare against standard numerical methods (Finite Element and Direct Numerical Simulations). We obtain excellent agreement, even when solving inverse problems given only sub-sampled velocity data on low dimensional sub-spaces (i.e. 1 component of the velocity on 1D domains to reconstruct 2D flows). The proposed method will be a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data, where noisy/missing data is the norm.

DT Article
DE Vlasov-Poisson equation; plasma; physics-informed neural networks;
   particle-in-cell; inverse problems
AB The Vlasov-Poisson equation is one of the most fundamental models in plasma physics. It has been widely used in areas such as confined plasmas in thermonuclear research and space plasmas in planetary magnetospheres. In this study, we explore the feasibility of the physics-informed neural networks for solving forward and inverse Vlasov-Poisson equation (PINN-Vlasov). The PINN-Vlasov method employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to represent the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation. The training dataset comprises the randomly sampled time, space, and velocity coordinates and the corresponding distribution function. We generate training data using the fully kinetic PIC simulation rather than the analytical solution to the Vlasov-Poisson equation to eliminate the correlation between data and equations. The Vlasov equation and Poisson equation are concurrently integrated into the PINN-Vlasov framework using automatic differentiation and the trapezoidal rule, respectively. By minimizing the residuals between the reconstructed distribution function and labeled data, and the physically constrained residuals of the Vlasov-Poisson equation, the PINN-Vlasov method is capable of dealing with both forward and inverse problems. For forward problems, the PINN-Vlasov method can solve the Vlasov-Poisson equation with given initial and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, the completely unknown electric field and equation coefficients can be predicted with the PINN-Vlasov method using little particle distribution data.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB In this paper, the event-triggered adaptive neural network (NN) asymptotic consensus control problem is studied for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown measurement sensitivity. A new distributed filter is designed to estimate the leader and solve the nondifferential problem of virtual controllers caused by the noncontinuous consensus error. The unknown nonlinear dynamics and measurement sensitivity are handled by using the NN approximators and adaptive estimation method, respectively. To avoid unnecessary data transmissions, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) composed of the measurement and control channels is designed. Then based on backstepping technique, an asymptotic consensus controller is obtained. It is proved that the closed-loop signals are all bounded, and the consensus error asymptotically converges to the origin. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the developed control method, we apply the developed control method to multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).

AB Selfadhesivity is a property of entropic polymatroids which guarantees that the polymatroid can be glued to an identical copy of itself along arbitrary restrictions such that the two pieces are independent given the common restriction. We show that positive definite matrices satisfy this condition as well and examine consequences for Gaussian conditional independence structures. New axioms of Gaussian CI are obtained by applying selfadhesivity to the previously known axioms of structural semigraphoids and orientable gaussoids.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB A long-running event represents a continuous stream of information on a given topic, such as natural disasters, stock market updates, or even ongoing customer relationship. These news stories include hundreds of individual, time-dependent texts. Simultaneously, new technologies have profoundly transformed the way we consume information. The need to obtain quick, relevant, and digest updates continuously has become a crucial issue and creates new challenges for the task of automatic document summarization. To that end, we introduce an innovative unsupervised method based on two competing sequence-to-sequence models to produce short updated summaries. The proposed architecture relies on several parameters to balance the outputs from the two autoencoders. This relation enables the overall model to correlate generated summaries with relevant information coming from both current and previous news iterations. Depending on the model configuration, we are then able to control the novelty or the consistency of terms included in generated summaries. We evaluate our method on a modified version of the TREC 2013, 2014, and 2015 datasets to track continuous events from a single source. We not only achieve state-of-the-art performance similar to other more complex unsupervised sentence compression approaches, but also influence the information included in the model in the summaries.

DT Article
DE Federated learning; Unsupervised learning; Person Re-identification;
   Contrastive learning; Clustering
AB Person Re-identification (ReID) has attracted considerable interests in recent years, largely driven by the escalating demand for public safety measures. However, the acquisition and handling of sensitive personal data can trigger significant privacy concerns. Federated learning has been introduced as a potential solution to this problem, with the goal of limiting the exposure of sensitive data across different participating entities (clients). Existing methods often depend on labour-intensive data annotations and face difficulties in maintaining cross-domain uniformity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Federated Unsupervised Cluster-Contrastive (FedUCC) method based on deep learning for Person ReID that follows a generic-to-specific learning strategy. First, FedUCC procures generic knowledge from a conventional federated learning scheme to aggregate and distribute parameters across local clients. Second, specialized knowledge is explored to facilitate client personalization by disentangling client-specific knowledge from generic knowledge through parameter localization. Third, to further enhance effective fine-grained patterns instead of overfitting on specialized client knowledge, we investigate two key aspects: patch-level feature alignment and camera-invariant learning. Comprehensive experiments on eight public benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.

AB Kernel fuzzy weighted local information C-means clustering is a widely used robust segmentation algorithm for noisy images. However, it cannot effectively solve the segmentation problem of blurred and noisy images. A local feature driven fuzzy local information C-means clustering with kernel metric for blurred and noisy image segmentation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a local ternary pattern is used to extract the feature information of the blurred and noisy images; Secondly, the image feature information is embedded into the objective function of fuzzy local information clustering and an optimization model for blurred and noisy image segmentation is established. Thirdly, Lagrange multiplier method is used to solve this optimization problem, and a dual-level alternating iterative clustering algorithm for blurred and noisy image segmentation is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better segmentation performance for blurred and noisy images than the latest robust fuzzy clustering-related algorithms, and its PSNR and ACC values increase by about 0.09 similar to 1.07 and 0.08 similar to 0.13, respectively.

ID PRODUCT QUANTIZATION
AB Quantizing is a promising approach to facilitate deploying deep neural networks on resource-limited devices. However, existing methods are challenged by obtaining computation acceleration and parameter compression while maintaining excellent performance. To achieve this goal, we propose PSE, a mixed quantization framework which combines product quantization (PQ), scalar quantization (SQ), and error correction. Specifically, we first employ PQ to obtain the floating-point codebook and index matrix of the weight matrix. Then, we use SQ to quantize the codebook into integers and reconstruct an integer weight matrix. Finally, we propose an error correction algorithm to update the quantized codebook and minimize the quantization error. We extensively evaluate our proposed method on various backbones, including VGG-16, ResNet-18/50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, EfficientNet-B3/B7, and DenseNet-201 on CIFAR- 10 and ILSVRC-2012 benchmarks. The experiments demonstrate that PSE reduces computation complexity and model size with acceptable accuracy loss. For example, ResNet-18 achieves 1.8x acceleration ratio and 30.4x compression ratio with less than 1.54% accuracy loss on CIFAR-10.

TI Latent Transformer Models for out-of-distribution detection
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Transformers; Out-of-distribution detection; Segmentation; Uncertainty
AB Any clinically-deployed image-processing pipeline must be robust to the full range of inputs it may be presented with. One popular approach to this challenge is to develop predictive models that can provide a measure of their uncertainty. Another approach is to use generative modelling to quantify the likelihood of inputs. Inputs with a low enough likelihood are deemed to be out-of-distribution and are not presented to the downstream predictive model. In this work, we evaluate several approaches to segmentation with uncertainty for the task of segmenting bleeds in 3D CT of the head. We show that these models can fail catastrophically when operating in the far out-of-distribution domain, often providing predictions that are both highly confident and wrong. We propose to instead perform out-of-distribution detection using the Latent Transformer Model: a VQ-GAN is used to provide a highly compressed latent representation of the input volume, and a transformer is then used to estimate the likelihood of this compressed representation of the input. We demonstrate this approach can identify images that are both far-and near-out-of-distribution, as well as provide spatial maps that highlight the regions considered to be out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we find a strong relationship between an image's likelihood and the quality of a model's segmentation on it, demonstrating that this approach is viable for filtering out unsuitable images.

ID MARKERS
AB Square fiducial markers are widely used in robotics to easily obtain pose and other information about the world from camera images. Processing the images to extract the markers is usually performed centrally with standard libraries but the code is typically aimed at PC-level hardware. Platforms with constrained processing power have difficulty handling multiple camera streams at real-time refresh rates. We introduce the Frappe (Fiducial Recognition Accelerated with Parallel Processing Elements) algorithm for detecting and decoding the popular ArUco tags. Designed to be implemented on the low cost hardware of the Raspberry Pi Zero, we show tag detection and decoding on images of 640 x 480 resolution exceeding 60 Hz, five times faster than the standard ArUco library, while maintaining similar detection performance and using much less energy. Using Frappe, we demonstrate improved real-world performance on a visual navigation task with our DOTS robot.

AB This paper studies the matching problem of cross-modality video data from a discrete distribution alignment view. Central to this discussion is the visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-reID), a crucial feature that bolsters surveillance systems' efficacy in monitoring individuals across diverse lighting conditions. Going beyond traditional image-to-image matching paradigms, a recent study shows that temporal information can bring richer cues to encode the pedestrian representation, improving the representation power of deep neural networks. However, this integration further complicates cross-modality data matching due to the joint processing of spatial and temporal information. This paper formulates the video data as a discrete distribution and aligns the cross-modality video representation by reducing the matching cost between the two distributions. To this end, a natural idea for aligning the videos is to reduce the divergence of distributions. Moreover, the powerful optimal transport (OT) scheme, which generates the optimal matching flows and establishes the relevance of two distributions, is also employed as a way to measure the distance of distributions. Nevertheless, we observe that endowing the OT in the advanced VI-reID feature extractor leads to a non-symmetric measurement. To mitigate this, the paper introduces a new metric, namely symmetric optimal transport (SOT), reformulating OT into a symmetric form. Thorough analyses and empirical studies affirm the superiority of the proposed SOT, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods according to standard benchmarking evaluations.

AB Electron and scanning probe microscopy produce vast amounts of data in the form of images or hyperspectral data, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy or 4D scanning transmission electron microscope, that contain information on a wide range of structural, physical, and chemical properties of materials. To extract valuable insights from these data, it is crucial to identify physically separate regions in the data, such as phases, ferroic variants, and boundaries between them. In order to derive an easily interpretable feature analysis, combining with well-defined boundaries in a principled and unsupervised manner, here we present a physics augmented machine learning method which combines the capability of variational autoencoders to disentangle factors of variability within the data and the physics driven loss function that seeks to minimize the total length of the discontinuities in images corresponding to latent representations. Our method is applied to various materials, including NiO-LSMO, BiFeO3, and graphene. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting meaningful information from large volumes of imaging data.

AB We give a definition of finitary type theories that subsumes many examples of dependent type theories, such as variants of Martin-Lof type theory, simple type theories, first-order and higher-order logics, and homotopy type theory. We prove several general meta-theorems about finitary type theories: weakening, admissibility of substitution and instantiation of metavariables, derivability of presuppositions, uniqueness of typing, and inversion principles. We then give a second formulation of finitary type theories in which there are no explicit contexts. Instead, free variables are explicitly annotated with their types. We provide translations between finitary type theories with and without contexts, thereby showing that they have the same expressive power. The context-free type theory is implemented in the nucleus of the Andromeda 2 proof assistant.

AB Object detection methods based on deep learning have made great progress in recent years and have been used successfully in many different applications. However, since they have been evaluated predominantly on datasets of natural images, it is still unclear how accurate and effective they can be if used in special domain applications, for example in scientific, industrial, etc. images, where the properties of the images are very different from those taken in natural scenes. In this study, we illustrate the challenges one needs to face in such a setting on a concrete practical application, involving the detection of a particular fluid phenomenon-bag-breakup-in images of droplet scattering, which differ significantly from natural images. Using two technologically mature and state-of-the-art object detection methods, RetinaNet and YOLOv7, we discuss what strategies need to be considered in this problem setting, and perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations to study their effects. Additionally, we also propose a new method to further improve accuracy of detection by utilizing information from several consecutive frames. We hope that the practical insights gained in this study can be of use to other researchers and practitioners when targeting applications where the images differ greatly from natural images.

ID PEAK DETECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SEARCH ALGORITHM
AB Due to the multimodal nature of real-world optimization problems, in recent years, there has been a great interest in multi-modal optimization algorithms. Multimodal optimization problems involve identifying multiple local/global optima. Niching techniques have been widely used to tackle multi-modal optimization problems. Most of the existing niching methods either require predefined niching parameters or extra information about the problem space. This paper presents a novel multimodal algorithm based on Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, which is constructed using the Fitness-Distance Balance (FDB) selection method. The purpose of applying the FDB selection method is to discover local/global optima with high potential as a fitness value along with the appropriate distance from solution candidates. Also, a local search scheme is used to enhance the convergence speed of the algorithm. Niching is a technique used in multimodal optimization to maintain diversity among multiple solutions in the population. The minimum distance between the solutions is called a "niche". The proper niching radius is the main challenge for existing approaches. Knowing the problem space helps determine the niche radius. This paper proposes a new multimodal optimization scheme that does not require prior knowledge of the problem space or the niching parameter. Seven state-of-the-art multi-modal optimization algorithms are compared to the multi-modal butterfly optimization algorithm (MBOA) on 16 benchmarks from the CEC 2013 and CEC 2015 competitions to evaluate its performance. Success rate, Number of function evaluations, Success performance, average number of optima found, Success accuracy, Maximum peak ratio, and Run-time performance criteria were measured over 25 runs to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that MBOA outperforms other algorithms according to most of the performance criteria.

AB Cold-chain logistics presents significant challenges to sustainable development in terms of economics, society, and the environment. To address this issue, this paper focuses on solving a real-world problem-the multipath location-routing problem-based cold-chain logistics (MPLRPCCL), which considers soft time windows and heterogeneous fleets. The mathematical model aims to optimize the total logistics costs, including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, cargo deterioration, penalties, operating depots, and renting fleets. To effectively solve this problem, the paper proposes three versions of a memetic algorithm (MA) that incorporate control modules for monitoring the MA's performance and improving its global optimization performance. Computational evaluations were conducted, and the results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and outperform the classic MA framework. Furthermore, the proposed model and algorithms were applied to real-world cases in Hangzhou city, China, demonstrating their practical applicability. Overall, this paper offers a promising approach to tackling the complex challenges posed by cold-chain logistics and contributes to the sustainable development of this important field.

AB Sustainable development requires social development and economic construction to be coordinated with the carrying capacity of the ecological environment. It necessitates adhering to the concept of sustainable development while pursuing economic development and social progress, improving the effective utilization rate of natural resources, and protecting and improving the ecological environment in which people live. This paper takes the e-commerce trade ecological industrial park in Dalian Economic Development Zone as an example to comprehensively evaluate its sustainable development ability using the state-of-the-art techniques of soft computing. Soft computing has recently gained appeal over traditional hard computing because it can cope with uncertainty just as easily as a human can. The basic aim of the study is to avoid excessive resource and environmental pressure hindering the coordinated development of various subsystems of the park. First, an evaluation index system containing four subsystem elements of the environment, society, economy, and resources was constructed, and the importance of each index in the evaluation index system was calculated. Second, the distance model and fuzzy logic of soft computing were used to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of the selected industrial park. Six criteria were established to describe the sustainability of the industrial park based on the opinions of industry professionals, with references to the research findings of local and international forerunners. The finding of the paper shows that the development level index of each subsystem of the industrial park has continued to rise, except for a few cases. The result also demonstrates that the overall coordinated development degree of the park has increased year by year from 2010 to 2019. This means that the coordinated development level has improved from the initial barely coordinated level in 2010 to the high-quality coordinated development level in 2019; however, the overall coordinated development degree is still less than 0.9. Through this study, it is possible to judge the sustainable development ability of the four subsystems of the industrial park and whether it meets the relevant standards of resource consumption and environmental protection stipulated by the state. It is of great practical significance for promoting the formation of a good ecological chain between enterprises in the park, realizing resource recycling, and reducing waste discharge.

AB The study examines the POS tagger's precise usage of words that are used by Tamil lyricists in their poems. Many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and voice recognition, consider POS tagging to be a preparatory step. The POS labels for Tamil words have been determined through several investigations. The research does not look at the precision of the POS tagger for unrecognized keywords or words that do not occur in the lexicon. The practice of categorizing each word in a phrase according to its grammatical function is known as POS tagging. Since the NLP software will come across terms that are not in its lexicon in real-world applications, the presence of unfamiliar words is a common problem in POS tagging. Tamil's agglutinative structure makes language challenging for computers to understand. In-depth research on Tamil phrases has highlighted the need for more research on Dravidian languages, as well as the process of annotating syntactic categories aimed at apiece word in the corpus, and Tamil POS tagger is generating an annotated corpus for Tamil lyricist lyrics. The Friedman Two-way Analysis of Variance was employed by the writers to learn more about the lyricist's use of grammar in this context. Linear regression is a data analysis approach that establishes a causal association amid variables by fit a linear model toward the data. The investigation's findings demonstrated how greatly the lyricists' linguistic decisions varied.

ID MODEL
AB In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various industries, with image processing playing an important role in the revolution. AI-powered image analysis has opened up new possibilities in healthcare diagnostics, autonomous navigation, and security surveillance, fuelling demand for sophisticated image-processing solutions. This paper describes an innovative approach to AI image processing that combines multi-sensor data fusion with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within a fuzzy neural network framework. This integration uses data from various sensors, including cameras, lidar, and radar, to improve the robustness and precision of image analysis and interpretation. The T-S model serves as the foundation for the information fusion strategy. A comprehensive investigation of deep learning algorithms reveals inherent strengths such as robustness and parallelism. However, it also identifies limitations, particularly in image segmentation tasks, characterized by challenges like premature convergence and prolonged computation times. The paper proposes a quantization technique for deep learning algorithms to address these issues and introduces chaotic optimization to expedite convergence rates. It also presents a novel three-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation method based on CNNs, which overcomes noise susceptibility in traditional two-dimensional approaches. Integrating Gray morphology and this three-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation method results in the development of a three-dimensional Gray Otsu model. This model is the basis for designing a fitness function for the CNN algorithm, optimizing its efficacy. Experimental validation demonstrates the proposed algorithm's effectiveness, achieving an impressive 91% accuracy rate while displaying robust noise resistance and versatility. Comparative assessments against other leading AI architectures, including multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network, recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory network, affirm the superior performance achieved by the proposed approach.

AB Cognitive radio network (CRNs) has been emerging and innovative technology in transmission of dynamic/automatic between different vehicles. An innovative idea in vehicular communication is the use of ad hoc characteristics to configure auto nodes on the fly, allowing for real-time data transmission via the Internet in vehicular ad hoc networks. To boost network infrastructure and strong data connection between vehicles in wireless vehicle ad hoc networks, several node auto-configuration schemas and node address-related methodologies were applied. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Node Selection with Opportunistic Routing (DNSOR) a method for reducing the time it takes for information to be forwarded between vehicles in ad hoc networks by taking advantage of the inherent mobility of vehicle relationships. Each vehicle node in an ad hoc network uses a copy of the data from all the other vehicles to calculate the network's density. Extensive simulation findings show that the suggested methodology outperforms the standard mobility-based routing calculation approaches in vehicle ad hoc networks by increasing QoS while decreasing overhead.

AB A framework to learn a multi-modal distribution is proposed, denoted as the conditional quantum generative adversarial network (C-qGAN). The neural network structure is strictly within a quantum circuit and, as a consequence, is shown to represent a more efficient state preparation procedure than current methods. This methodology has the potential to speed-up algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo analysis. In particular, after demonstrating the effectiveness of the network in the learning task, the technique is applied to price Asian option derivatives, providing the foundation for further research on other path-dependent options.

AB We present novel approximates of variational losses, being applicable for the training of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The formulations reflect classic Sobolev space theory for partial differential equations (PDEs) and their weak formulations. The loss approximates rest on polynomial differentiation realised by an extension of classic Gauss-Legendre cubatures, we term Sobolev cubatures, and serve as a replacement of automatic differentiation. We prove the training time complexity of the resulting Sobolev -PINNs with polynomial differentiation to be less than required by PINNs relying on automatic differentiation. On top of one-to-two order of magnitude speed-up the Sobolev-PINNs are demonstrated to achieve closer solution approximations for prominent forward and inverse, linear and non-linear PDE problems compared to established PINNs.

AB Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation. Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable.However, there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and the difficulty level of segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common metrics used to assess performance fail to capture the impact of this mismatch, particularly when dealing with datasets in clinical settings that involve challenging segmentation tasks, pathologies with low signal, and reference annotations that are uncertain, small, or empty. Limitations of common metrics may result in ineffective machine learning research in designing and optimizing models. To effectively evaluate the clinical value of such models, it is essential to consider factors such as the uncertainty associated with reference annotations, the ability to accurately measure performance regardless of the size of the reference annotation volume, and the classification of cases where reference annotations are empty.We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference annotations influence the value of metrics on a stroke in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify suitable metrics in such a setting. We compare our results to the BRATS 2019 and Spinal Cord public data sets. We show how uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation. The evaluation code was released to encourage further analysis of this topic https://github.com/SophieOstmeier/UncertainSmallEmpty.git.

AB Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) widely exist in real applications, and most of them are computationally difficult or NP-hard. How to solve MOCOPs efficiently has been a challenging issue. The heuristic algorithms have achieved good results on MOCOPs, while they require careful hand-crafted heuristics and iterative computing for the solutions. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been employed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and many DRL-based algorithms have been proposed with promising results. However, it is difficult for these existing algorithms to obtain diverse solutions efficiently for MOCOPs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MOMDAM to solve MOCOPs. In MOMDAM, the attention model (AM) is used and can simply modify the encoder to facilitate the construction of solutions with any weight vector, as well as the multiple decoders (MD) are employed to obtain diverse policies to further improve the diversity and convergence of the solutions. Experimental results on the bi -objective traveling salesman problem show that, MOMDAM significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and running time.

AB Ensure worker safety in the industry is crucial. Despite efforts to improve safety, statistics show a plateau in the reduction of these accidents in recent years. To decrease the number of accidents, compliance with established industrial safety standards and regulations by competent authorities must be ensured, including the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE usage is of paramount importance, as it is essential to prevent accidents from occurring. This work aims to improve worker safety by verifying PPE usage. Technology plays a key role here. A cost-effective solution is proposed to monitor PPE usage in real time. Most existing safety control systems are costly and require considerable maintenance. A low-cost computer vision system is proposed to supervise safety in industrial facilities. This system uses object detection and tracking technology in low-cost embedded devices and can generate alarms in real time if PPE is not used. Unlike other works, temporal information is used to generate the alarms. Safety managers receive this information to take necessary actions. Emphasis has been placed on cost, scalability, and ease of use to facilitate system implementation in industrial plants. The result is an effective system that improves worker safety by verifying established safety measures at a reduced cost. The methodology used improves the Average Precision of PPE detection by 6%. In addition, unlike other studies, the problem of application deployment is addressed, which has an impact on its cost.

AB As the rapidly evolving field of machine learning continues to produce incredibly useful tools and models, the potential for quantum computing to provide speed up for machine learning algorithms is becoming increasingly desirable. In particular, quantum circuits in place of classical convolutional filters for image detection-based tasks are being investigated for the ability to exploit quantum advantage. However, these attempts, referred to as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), lack the ability to efficiently process data with multiple channels and, therefore, are limited to relatively simple inputs. In this work, we present a variety of hardware-adaptable quantum circuit ansatzes for use as convolutional kernels, and demonstrate that the quantum neural networks we report outperform existing QCNNs on classification tasks involving multi-channel data. We envision that the ability of these implementations to effectively learn inter-channel information will allow quantum machine learning methods to operate with more complex data.

AB Multi-view subspace clustering has aroused more and more attention due to its ability to explore data correlation from multiple views without stressful label annotations. Although a plethora of methods have been developed, they are powerless considering the original data may not be separable into subspaces. In this paper, we target to achieve a smooth representation from multi-view data which is committed to facilitating the downstream clustering task. Our assumption is that samples in the same cluster always tend to be densely connected. In detail, the proposed method can maintain the graph geometric structure by performing graph filtering to obtain the smooth representation. Furthermore, we unify the smooth representation learning and the subsequent multi-view clustering in a joint framework, hence the "multi-view clustering-friendly"representation can be expected. As a result, the smooth representation learning of each view and the achieving of multi-view clustering can be boosted in a mutual reinforcement manner towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments on common multi-view datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our mode, compared to other SOTAs over the clustering performance.

TI UNesT: Local spatial representation learning with hierarchical
   transformer for efficient medical segmentation
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Hierarchical transformer; Whole brain segmentation; Renal substructure
   segmentation
AB Transformer-based models, capable of learning better global dependencies, have recently demonstrated exceptional representation learning capabilities in computer vision and medical image analysis. Transformer reformats the image into separate patches and realizes global communication via the self-attention mechanism. However, positional information between patches is hard to preserve in such 1D sequences, and loss of it can lead to sub-optimal performance when dealing with large amounts of heterogeneous tissues of various sizes in 3D medical image segmentation. Additionally, current methods are not robust and efficient for heavy-duty medical segmentation tasks such as predicting a large number of tissue classes or modeling globally inter-connected tissue structures. To address such challenges and inspired by the nested hierarchical structures in vision transformer, we proposed a novel 3D medical image segmentation method (UNesT), employing a simplified and faster-converging transformer encoder design that achieves local communication among spatially adjacent patch sequences by aggregating them hierarchically. We extensively validate our method on multiple challenging datasets, consisting of multiple modalities, anatomies, and a wide range of tissue classes, including 133 structures in the brain, 14 organs in the abdomen, 4 hierarchical components in the kidneys, inter-connected kidney tumors and brain tumors. We show that UNesT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and evaluate its generalizability and data efficiency. Particularly, the model achieves whole brain segmentation task complete ROI with 133 tissue classes in a single network, outperforming prior state-of-the-art method SLANT27 ensembled with 27 networks. Our model performance increases the mean DSC score of the publicly available Colin and CANDI dataset from 0.7264 to 0.7444 and from 0.6968 to 0.7025, respectively. Code, pre-trained models, and use case pipeline are available at: https://github.com/MASILab/UNesT.

AB Deep Learning (DL), a groundbreaking branch of Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a driving force in both theoretical and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI). DL algorithms, rooted in complex and non-linear artificial neural systems, excel at extracting high-level features from data. DL has demonstrated human -level performance in real-world tasks, including clinical diagnostics, and has unlocked solutions to previously intractable problems in virtual agent design, robotics, genomics, neuroimaging, computer vision, and industrial automation. In this paper, the most relevant advances from the last few years in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and several applications to neuroscience, neuroimaging, computer vision, and robotics are presented, reviewed and discussed. In this way, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI methods, models and applications within a collection of works presented at the 9th International Conference on the Interplay between Natural and Artificial Computation (IWINAC). The works presented in this paper are excellent examples of new scientific discoveries made in laboratories that have successfully transitioned to real-life applications.

TI How to compute the convex hull of a binary shape? A real-time algorithm
   to compute the convex hull of a binary shape
SO JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING

DE Convex hull; Binary shape; Real-time
ID POINTS
AB In this article, we present an algorithm to compute the convex hull of a binary shape. Efficient algorithms to compute the convex hull of a set of points had been proposed long time ago. For a binary shape, the common practice is to rely on one of them: to compute the convex hull of binary shape, all pixels of the shape are first listed, and then the convex hull is computed on this list of points. The computed convex hull is finally rasterized to provide the final result [as, for example, in the famous scikit-image library (scikit-image: Image processing in python. https://scikit-image.org)]. To compute the convex hull of an arbitrary set of points, the points of the list that lie on the outline of the convex hull must be selected (to simplify, we call these points "extrema"). To find them, for an arbitrary set of points, it is necessary to browse all the points but not in the particular case of a binary shape. In this specific situation, the extrema necessarily belong to the inner boundary of the shape. It is a waste of time to browse all the pixels as it is possible to discard most of them when we search for these extrema. Based on this analysis, we propose a new method to compute the convex hull dedicated to binary shapes. This method browses as few pixels as possible to select a small subset of boundary pixels. Then it deduces the convex hull only from this subset. As the size of the subset is very small, the convex hull is computed in real time. We compare it with the commonly used methods and common functions from libraries to prove that our approach is faster. This comparison shows that, for a very small shape, the difference is acceptable, but when the area of the shape grows, this difference becomes significant. This leads us to conclude that substituting current functions to compute convex hull of binary shapes with our algorithm in frequently used libraries would lead to a great improvement.

AB Recently, the xEV market has been expanding by strengthening regulations on fossil fuel vehicles. It is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of batteries, one of the core components of xEVs. Furthermore, estimating the battery's state of health (SOH) is critical. There are model-based and data-based methods for SOH estimation. Model-based methods have limitations in linearly modeling the nonlinear internal state changes of batteries. In data-based methods, high-quality datasets containing large quantities of data are crucial. Since obtaining battery datasets through measurement is difficult, this paper supplements insufficient battery datasets using time-series generative adversarial network and compares the improvement rate in SOH estimation accuracy through long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit based on recurrent neural networks. According to the results, the average root mean square error of battery SOH estimation improved by approximately 25%, and the learning stability improved by approximately 40%.

AB To execute quantum circuits on a quantum processor, they must be modified to meet the physical constraints of the quantum device. This process, called quantum circuit mapping, results in a gate/circuit depth overhead that depends on both the circuit properties and the hardware constraints, being the limited qubit connectivity a crucial restriction. In this paper, we propose to extend the characterization of quantum circuits by including qubit interaction graph properties using graph theory-based metrics in addition to previously used circuit-describing parameters. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and clustering of quantum circuits and a comparison of performance when run on different quantum processors, aiding in developing better mapping techniques. Our study reveals a correlation between interaction graph-based parameters and mapping performance metrics for various existing configurations of quantum devices. We also provide a comprehensive collection of quantum circuits and algorithms for benchmarking future compilation techniques and quantum devices.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Quantum neural networks hold significant promise for numerous applications, particularly as they can be executed on the current generation of quantum hardware. However, due to limited qubits or hardware noise, conducting large-scale experiments often requires significant resources. Moreover, the output of the model is susceptible to corruption by quantum hardware noise. To address this issue, we propose the use of ensemble techniques, which involve constructing a single machine learning model based on multiple instances of quantum neural networks. In particular, we implement bagging and AdaBoost techniques, with different data loading configurations, and evaluate their performance on both synthetic and real-world classification and regression tasks. To assess the potential performance improvement under different environments, we conducted experiments on both simulated, noiseless software and IBM superconducting-based QPUs, suggesting these techniques can mitigate the quantum hardware noise. Additionally, we quantify the amount of resources saved using these ensemble techniques. Our findings indicate that these methods enable the construction of large, powerful models even on relatively small quantum devices.

AB Image recognition is one of the primary applications of machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, machine learning models used in modern image recognition systems consist of millions of parameters that usually require significant computational time to be adjusted. Moreover, adjustment of model hyperparameters leads to additional overhead. Because of this, new developments in machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization techniques are required. This paper presents a quantum-inspired hyperparameter optimization technique and a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for supervised learning. We benchmark our hyperparameter optimization method over standard black-box objective functions and observe performance improvements in the form of reduced expected run times and fitness in response to the growth in the size of the search space. We test our approaches in a car image classification task and demonstrate a full-scale implementation of the hybrid quantum ResNet model with the tensor train hyperparameter optimization. Our tests show a qualitative and quantitative advantage over the corresponding standard classical tabular grid search approach used with a deep neural network ResNet34. A classification accuracy of 0.97 was obtained by the hybrid model after 18 iterations, whereas the classical model achieved an accuracy of 0.92 after 75 iterations.

AB Infrared video colorization can significantly improve perceptual quality by predicting reasonable colors and restoring vivid details, especially in harsh environments. However, as an inconspicuous computer vision task, there is no specialized method. Besides, directly applying current grayscale colorization methods may generate structurally obscure and temporally inconsistent frames. In this paper, we design an infrared video colorization network CPNet aims to generate visually plausible and spatial-temporal consistent colorized videos. To achieve this, a feature fusion module and a hierarchical colorizer are designed to learn the importance of each consecutive frame and the local and global correlation of the integrated features, respectively. In addition, to consolidate the temporal consistency at a fine-grained level, we further introduce a composite loss function to narrow the distance between high-level feature representations while retaining pixel-wise correspondence. Moreover, a new metric named Mean Temporal Variation Similarity (MTVS) is proposed for effectively evaluating the degree of video continuity. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the KAIST dataset demonstrate the superiority of CPNet to produce more authentic colorized videos than state-of-the-art colorization methods. In terms of quantitative comparison, CPNet achieves improvements of at least 0.89 dB on PSNR, 0.016 on SSIM, and a significant promotion on MTVS. In addition, experiments conducted on the DAVIS dataset also prove the applicability of CPNet for grayscale video colorization task.

AB As technology advances, many people are utilising credit cards to purchase their necessities, and the number of credit card scams is increasing tremendously. However, illegal card transactions have been on the rise, costing financial institutions millions of dollars each year. The development of efficient fraud detection techniques is critical in reducing these deficits, but it is difficult due to the extremely unbalanced nature of most credit card datasets. As compared to conventional fraud detection methods, the proposed method will help in automatically detecting fraud, identifying hidden correlations in data and reducing the time for the verification process. This is achieved by selecting relevant and unique features by using Bat Optimization Algorithm (BOA). Next, balancing is performed in the highly imbalanced credit card fraud dataset using the Synthetic Minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Then finally the CNN model for anomaly detection in credit card data is built using a full center loss function to improve fraud detection performance and stability. The proposed model is tested with the Kaggle dataset and yields around 99% accuracy.

AB For the traditional machine learning methods rely on manual experience and deep learning classification model depth and complex structure, resulting in poor gangue classification performance, this paper proposes a coal gangue recognition method (CNN-SVM) based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we use a generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generate new coal gangue samples and expand the gangue dataset by traditional image enhancement techniques to increase the data samples and improve the generalization of the model; then we construct an efficient and simple CNN as a coal gangue feature extractor and verify the effect of convolutional kernel size on the accuracy of the model, and determine the 5x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document}5 size of the convolutional kernel to extract more accurate and comprehensive coal gangue; Finally, it is combined with SVM using grid optimization to improve the accuracy of coal gangue recognition. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 97.5%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\%$$\end{document}, which has obvious advantages compared with traditional classification models and classical classification models, and the recognition speed is faster compared with the mainstream classification models, which provides a new idea for coal gangue recognition.

DE Long-term visual tracking; Global re-detection; Feature fusion; Region
   proposal network
AB In long-term visual tracking, object often disappears due to occlusion or out-of-view, and the tracking algorithm needs to re-detect the object when it reappears. Therefore, the re-detection method is very important for long-term visual tracking, and the performance of traditional re-detection methods needs to be further improved. In addition, most of the traditional re-detection methods use the global sliding window or gradually expanding the search region to complete the tracking task. The computational efficiency of these methods is very low, resulting in slow running speeds. Aiming at these problems, inspired by the GlobalTrack, we propose a global re-detection method based on the Siamese network. Firstly, a feature fusion refinement module is proposed to obtain more comprehensive features. Secondly, a multi-scale residual block is proposed to emphasize the important information in the features. Finally, the features are processed by a two-stage region proposal network to obtain high-quality proposal boxes. The global re-detection method proposed in this paper is combined with four existing short-term visual tracking algorithms and constructed as four long-term visual tracking algorithms. The constructed long-term visual tracking algorithms are experimented on the long-term tracking dataset, and the experimental results show that the constructed long-term visual tracking algorithms have good long-term tracking performance and the speed can meet the real-time requirements.

ID IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
AB In this paper, we present a new dataset named CityUPlaces, comprising 17,771 images from various campus buildings, which contains 9 major categories and further derives 18 minor categories based on the internal and external scenes of these identities. Each category is not balanced ranging from 344 to 1539 with diverse variations in angle, attractions, views, illumination, etc. Compared to existing large-scale datasets, the proposed dataset shows its strengths in two aspects: (1) it contains a moderate number of both indoor and outdoor images under different conditions for each identity, which enables diverse real-time recognition tasks by featuring hierarchical categorization with reasonable dataset size; (2) the issue of label noise is significantly alleviated for each identity in the dedicated annotation and filtering stages to facilitate the subsequent tasks. This provides great flexibility to perform these vision-based tasks with different learning objectives in a real-time mode. Moreover, we propose a novel lightweight classification framework that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the dataset with the relatively low computational complexity of fewer training parameters and floating-point operations per second, by taking advantage of the involved coarse-to-fined learning strategy in a self-transfer manner. This laterally confirms the applicability of the new dataset. We also conduct experiments on the MIT Indoors and Paris datasets, where the proposed method still achieves superior performance that validates its efficacy. The dataset and code will be publicly available in the future.

AB We present an approach for using machine learning to automatically discover the governing equations and unknown properties (in this case, masses) of real physical systems from observations. We train a 'graph neural network' to simulate the dynamics of our Solar System's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data. We then use symbolic regression to correctly infer an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions our method makes are translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. It did not, however, require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants, but nonetheless, they, too, were accurately inferred with our method. Naturally, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, but our results demonstrate that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data.

AB Advances in technology have led to advances in breast cancer screening by detecting symptoms that doctors have overlooked. In this paper, an automatic detection system for breast cancer cases based on Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed. First, using IoT technology, direct medical images are sent to the data repository after the suspicious person's visit through medical equipment equipped with IoT. Then, in order to help radiologists, interpret medical images as best as possible, we use four pre-trained convolutional neural network models including InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG19 and ResNet152. These models are combined by an ensemble classifier. Also, these models are used to accurately predict cases with breast cancer, healthy people, and cases with pneumonia by using two datasets of X-RAY and CT-scan in a three-class classification. Finally, the best result obtained for CT -scan images belongs to InceptionResNetV2 architecture with 99.36% accuracy and for X-RAY images belongs to InceptionV3 architecture with 96.94% accuracy. The results show that this method leads to a reduction in daily visits to medical centers and thus reduces the pressure on the medical care system. It also helps radiologists and medical staff to detect breast cancer in its early stages.

AB Quality evaluation of food products, agricultural produce to be specific, has gained momentum from past few decades due to the increased awareness among consumers across the world. This has resulted in the increased emphasis on the development and use of quality assessment techniques in food industry. Moreover, there is a need to automate the quality monitoring of agricultural produce like fruits and vegetables which is otherwise done manually in developing countries hence labor intensive, time consuming and subjective in nature. This paper presents an empirical analysis to build a rapid, robust, real-time, non-destructive computer vision based quality assessment model for mango fruits. The work employs the automatic disease classification of mango fruits based on machine and deep learning models. Firstly, the dataset of colored mango fruits images with 2279 images falling into three classes and another dataset of soft X-ray images of mango fruits with 572 images belonging to two quality classes are developed for detecting external and internal defects, respectively. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) with two hidden layers, which may be considered as the starting point for deep learning technique, is proposed as machine learning model to classify the color images of mango fruits into one of three external quality classes with 95.1% accuracy and also to classify the soft X-ray images into two internal quality classes with 97.5% accuracy. In order to step out of feature engineering, actual deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models, a customized CNN model and pre-trained CNN models, VGGNet (VGG16) and DenseNet121 were also explored for mango disease classification. The maximum validation accuracy of custom CNN was found to be with 91.52% and 98.7% for color and augmented X-ray images, respectively. The classification accuracy of pre-trained models were found to be reasonably good for the color images but exhibited high variability in results and made it difficult to draw a general conclusion for the proposed datasets. However, the proposed MLP NN model based on few basic intensity and geometric features and also the proposed customized CNN model were found to be the best models and they outperform the state of the art reported in the literature.

AB In the field of global shipping, intelligent container code recognition has become a popular research topic. To address the issues of poor recognition accuracy and real-time performance in the complex port environment, this paper proposes a real-time container code recognition method based on YOLOV5. The proposed method consists of two stages: container code localization and container code recognition. First, for container code localization, the backbone component consists of MobileOne blocks to enhance feature extraction capability and accelerate inference speed. Second, for container code recognition, a lightweight MobileNetV3 is used as the backbone. Third, a feature extraction module, called Multiple Reuse Feature Pyramid Networks (MRFPN), is designed to extract sufficient semantic information. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves accuracy rates of 96.5% and 93.5% in the container code localization and container code recognition stages, respectively, while significantly reducing the number of parameters, computations, and model size, and improving inference speed. Additionally, the proposed method performs better in terms of real-time performance and can meet the requirements of practical applications.

AB Energy-aware scheduling has attracted increasing attention mainly due to economic benefits as well as reducing the carbon footprint at companies. In this paper, an energy-aware scheduling problem in a distributed blocking flow-shop with sequence-dependent setup times is investigated to minimize both makespan and total energy consumption. A mixed-integer linear programming model is constructed and a cooperative iterated greedy algorithm based on Q-learning (CIG) is proposed. In the CIG, a top-level Q-learning is focused on enhancing the utilization ratio of machines to minimize makespan by finding a scheduling policy from four sequence-related operations. A bottom-level Q-learning is centered on improving energy efficiency to reduce total energy consumption by learning the optimal speed governing policy from four speed-related operations. According to the structure characteristics of solutions, several properties are explored to design an energy-saving strategy and acceleration strategy. The experimental results and statistical analysis prove that the CIG is superior to the stateof-the-art competitors with improvement percentages of 20.16 % over 2880 instances from the well-known benchmark set in the literature.

ID TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; USER EQUILIBRIUM; UNIQUENESS
AB The rapid evolution of technology in connected automated and autonomous vehicles offers immense potential for revolutionizing future intelligent traffic control and management. This potential is exemplified by the diverse range of control paradigms, ranging from self-routing to centralized control. However, the selection among these paradigms is beyond technical consideration but a delicate balance between autonomous decision-making and holistic system optimization. A pivotal quantitative parameter in navigating this balance is the concept of the "price of anarchy" (PoA) inherent in autonomous decision frameworks. This paper analyses the price of anarchy for road networks with traffic of CAV. We model a traffic network as a routing game in which vehicles are selfish agents who choose routes to travel autonomously to minimize travel delays caused by road congestion. Unlike existing research in which the latency function of road congestion was based on polynomial functions like the well-known BPR function, we focus on routing games where an exponential function can specify the latency of road traffic. We first calculate a tight upper bound for the price of anarchy for this class of games and then compare this result with the tight upper bound of the PoA for routing games with the BPR latency function. The comparison shows that as long as the traffic volume is lower than the road capacity, the tight upper bound of the PoA of the games with the exponential function is lower than the corresponding value with the BPR function. Finally, numerical results based on real-world traffic data demonstrate that the exponential function can approximate road latency as close as the BPR function with even tighter exponential parameters, which results in a relatively lower upper bound.

AB Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has been proposed to alleviate the conflict between data annotation cost and model performance through employing sparsely-grained (i.e., point-, box-, scribble-wise) supervision and has shown promising performance, particularly in the image segmentation field. However, it is still a very challenging task due to the limited supervision, especially when only a small number of labeled samples are available. Additionally, almost all existing WSL segmentation methods are designed for star-convex structures which are very different from curvilinear structures such as vessels and nerves. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsely annotated segmentation framework for curvilinear structures, named YoloCurvSeg. A very essential component of YoloCurvSeg is image synthesis. Specifically, a background generator delivers image backgrounds that closely match the real distributions through inpainting dilated skeletons. The extracted backgrounds are then combined with randomly emulated curves generated by a Space Colonization Algorithm based foreground generator and through a multilayer patch-wise contrastive learning synthesizer. In this way, a synthetic dataset with both images and curve segmentation labels is obtained, at the cost of only one or a few noisy skeleton annotations. Finally, a segmenter is trained with the generated dataset and possibly an unlabeled dataset. The proposed YoloCurvSeg is evaluated on four publicly available datasets (OCTA500, CORN, DRIVE and CHASEDB1) and the results show that YoloCurvSeg outperforms state-of-the-art WSL segmentation methods by large margins. With only one noisy skeleton annotation (respectively 0.14%, 0.03%, 1.40%, and 0.65% of the full annotation), YoloCurvSeg achieves more than 97% of the fully-supervised performance on each dataset. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/llmir/YoloCurvSeg.

DE Satisfiability modulo theories; Theory combination; Polite combination
AB Polite theory combination is a method for obtaining a solver for a combination of two (or more) theories using the solvers of each individual theory as black boxes. Unlike the earlier Nelson-Oppen method, which is usable only when both theories are stably infinite, only one of the theories needs to be strongly polite in order to use the polite combination method. In its original presentation, politeness was required from one of the theories rather than strong politeness, which was later proven to be insufficient. The first contribution of this paper is a proof that indeed these two notions are different, obtained by presenting a polite theory that is not strongly polite. We also study several variants of this question.The cost of the generality afforded by the polite combination method, compared to the Nelson-Oppen method, is a larger space of arrangements to consider, involving variables that are not necessarily shared between the purified parts of the input formula. The second contribution of this paper is a hybrid method (building on both polite and Nelson-Oppen combination), which aims to reduce the number of considered variables when a theory is stably infinite with respect to some of its sorts but not all of them. The time required to reason about arrangements is exponential in the worst case, so reducing the number of variables considered has the potential to improve performance significantly. We show preliminary evidence for this by demonstrating significant speed-up on a smart contract verification benchmark.

AB One method of assessing the image quality of a mammography unit is to estimate a contrast-detail-curve (CDC) that is obtained from images of a technical phantom. It has been proposed to estimate this CDC by using an end-to-end neural network (NN) which only needs one image to determine the CDC. That approach, however, has been developed on the basis of images of one single mammography unit. In this work, we train NNs on synthetic images of contrast-detail phantoms for mammography and test the so-trained NNs on images that are obtained from real mammography units. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that such a deep learning approach is capable to generalize to predict CDCs for various real mammography units. Our experiments cover various manufacturers and the proposed approach is shown to work across different NN architectures and preprocessing methods which highlights its generalizability.

AB How to quickly obtain information about crisis events on social media such as Twitter and Weibo is crucial for follow-up rescue work and the promotion of postdisaster reconstruction. Therefore, it is very important to obtain useful information through multimodal summary generation technology. The current technology for generating crisis event summaries is mainly affected by unimodal bias and disregards the diversity of information in text and images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical multimodal crisis event summary generation model based on the modal alignment premise and hierarchical thinking. First, the visual context vector and text context vector are obtained, and then the hierarchical multimodal pointer model is employed to generate the text summary. Thus, the modal deviation is solved. Second, to select high-quality images, this paper proposes a dynamic selection strategy, which to some extent considers the requirements of the high correlation between text and images and the diversity of crisis information. Last, the experimental results based on the crisis event data in the MSMO dataset show that the proposed model achieves good performance in the summary generation and image selection of crisis events.

AB Physical exertion is a stress condition that affects how we normally produce speech. It alters both the temporal and spectral pattern of speech characteristics. Therefore, speech utterances can be used as a cost-effective telehealth solution to detect whether a person is under physical exertion. This paper deals with the detection of shortness of breath (or out-of-breath) condition from speech under physical load by using an multi-task learning (MTL) framework. The primary classification targets are the neutral and the out-of-breath classes. Naturally these are binary targets and do not reflect the actual extent of exertion. This leads to the creation of a novel auxiliary target learning in collaboration with a pre-trained expert system. The targets here indicate the level of exertion under physical load. The MTL framework for both the convolutional neural network (CNN) and CNN-long short-term memory (CLSTM) network performs nearly 1.5% (F1-score) better than the single task learning (STL) framework. In addition to that, out-of-breath speech has more influence on the lower frequency spectrum. Warped spectrograms are given as input to the networks, enabling the deep networks to focus on lower spectral regions. The non-linear frequency warping is achieved by Mel-scale transformation and constant-Q-transform (CQT). CQT, being less dependent on fixed-window size, shows at least 6.57% (F1-score) improvement over Mel-based inputs. The MTL framework, combined with the warped spectrum, performs better in classifying out-of-breath speech from neutral.

ID RESOLUTION
AB QCDCL is one of the main algorithmic paradigms for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We design a new technique to show lower bounds for the running time in QCDCL algorithms. For this we model QCDCL by concisely defined proof systems and identify a new width measure for formulas, which we call gauge. We show that for a large class of QBFs, large (e.g. linear) gauge implies exponential lower bounds for QCDCL proof size. We illustrate our technique by computing the gauge for a number of sample QBFs, thereby providing new exponential lower bounds for QCDCL. Our technique is the first bespoke lower bound technique for QCDCL.

ID SPREAD
AB Social media has become an integral part of people's lives, resulting in a constant flow of information. However, a concerning trend has emerged with the rapid spread of fake news, attributed to the lack of verification mechanisms. Fake news has far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, disrupting democracy, fueling social tensions, and impacting various domains such as health, environment, and the economy. In order to identify fake news with data sparsity especially with low resources languages such as Arabic and its dialects, we propose a few-shot learning fake news detection model based on sentence transformer fine tuning, utilizing no crafted prompts and language model with few parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve higher performances with fewer news samples. This approach provided 71% F1 score on the Algerian dialect fake news dataset and 70% F1 score on the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) version of the same dataset, which prove that the approach can work on the standard Arabic and its dialects. Therefore, the proposed model can identify fake news in several domains concerning the Algerian community such as politics, COVID-19, tourism, ecommerce, sport, accidents and cars prices.

ID VERIFICATION; LIBRARY; BOUNDS
AB Floating-point arithmetic is a well-known and extremely efficient way of performing approximate computations over the real numbers. Although it requires some careful considerations, floating-point numbers are nowadays routinely used to prove mathematical theorems. Numerical computations have been applied in the context of formal proofs too, as illustrated by the CoqInterval library. But these computations do not benefit from the powerful floating-point units available in modern processors, since they are emulated inside the logic of the formal system. This paper experiments with the use of hardware floating-point numbers for numerically intensive proofs verified by the Coq proof assistant. This gives rise to various questions regarding the formalization, the implementation, the usability, and the level of trust. This approach has been applied to the CoqInterval and ValidSDP libraries, which demonstrates a speedup of at least one order of magnitude.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION METHOD
AB The kernel k-means method usually loses its power when clustering high-dimensional data, due to a large number of irrelevant features. We propose a novel sparse kernel k-means clustering (SKKM) to extend the advantages of kernel k-means to the high-dimensional cases. We assign each feature a 0-1 indicator and optimize an equivalent kernel k-means loss function while penalizing the sum of the indicators. An alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to estimate both the class labels and the feature indicators. We prove the consistency of both clustering and feature selection of the proposed method. In addition, we apply the proposed framework to the normalized cut. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides better/comparable performance compared to the existing high-dimensional clustering methods.

DE 3D point cloud; Generalized zero-shot; Contrastive learning;
   Recursive-loop
AB Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen categories by transferring semantic knowledge and merely utilizing seen class data for training. Recent feature generation methods in the 2D image domain have made great progress. However, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud zero-shot learning. This work aims to facilitate research on 3D point cloud generalized zero-shot learning. Different from previous works, we focus on synthesizing the more high-level discriminative point cloud features. To this end, we design a representation enhancement strategy to generate the features. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Generative Network with Recursive -Loop, termed as CGRL, which can be leveraged to enlarge the inter-class distances and narrow the intra-class gaps. By applying the contrastive representations to the generative model in a recursive-loop form, it can provide the self-guidance for the generator recurrently, which can help yield more discriminative features and train a better classifier. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks, including ModelNet40, McGill, and ScanObjectNN. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach and it can outperform the state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Code is available at https: //github.com/photon-git/CGRL

AB In large-scale natural disasters and special criminal cases, surface features of bodies, such as faces and fingerprints, are easily destroyed. Teeth possess strong high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and high hardness, which can compensate for the shortcomings of the aforementioned situations. This paper proposes an identification method based on the aggregated features of multi-scale dental impression images. Firstly, a method exploiting the adaptive object detection method based on YOLOv8 is proposed to segment toothprints. Next, a novel geometric feature named calibrated offset distance is extracted, combined with the SIFT feature method, to extract multi-scale and multi-dimensional features from the global toothprint, local toothprints, and single-tooth prints. Finally, all features are aggregated to enhance the descriptive ability and robustness. Experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper demonstrates good identification performance.

AB Generating high-quality images from text remains a challenge in visual-language understanding, with text image consistency being a major concern. Particularly, the most popular metric R-precision may not accurately reflect the text-image consistency, leading to misleading semantics in generated images. Albeit its significance, designing a better text-image consistency metric surprisingly remains under-explored in the community. In this paper, we make a further step forward to develop a novel CLIP-based metric, Semantic Similarity Distance (SSD), which is both theoretically founded from a distributional viewpoint and empirically verified on benchmark datasets. We also introduce Parallel Deep Fusion Generative Adversarial Networks (PDF-GAN), which use two novel components to mitigate inconsistent semantics and bridge the text-image semantic gap. A series of experiments indicate that, under the guidance of SSD, our developed PDF-GAN can induce remarkable enhancements in the consistency between texts and images while preserving acceptable image quality over the CUB and COCO datasets.

ID REVERSION STRATEGY; OPTIMIZATION
AB Online portfolio selection (OPS) has received increasing attention from machine learning and quantitative finance communities. Despite their effectiveness, the pioneering OPS methods have several key limitations. First, price predictions are usually based on predetermined trends, which is inadequate for a fast-changing market patterns. Second, each asset is treated individually, ignoring the pervading relevance among the assets. Third, the risk terms are usually missing or inappropriate in optimizations. This paper proposes a novel OPS method, namely, the online low-dimension ensemble method, to overcome the limitations. Motivated by the stylized facts for the co-movements of assets, the financial market is regarded as a high-dimensional dynamical system (HDS), and a large number of low-dimensional subsystems (LDSs) are randomly generated from the HDS to extract the correlation information among the assets. The assets' price predictions are first made using these LDSs and then aggregated to formulate the final prediction using ensemble learning techniques. Thanks to the particular merits brought by our predicting scheme, we also develop a novel high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation/prediction method for short-term data, efficiently assessing the instantaneous risk of the projected portfolios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach obtains more accurate predictions as the correlation information is fully exploited. With the predictive instantaneous risk assessment, a more appropriate optimization problem is proposed, substantially improving the OPS setting and leading to significantly better investment performance. Therefore, this study develops a flexible and promising approach to learning fast-changing market patterns and demonstrates that the high-dimensional feature of the market is a crucial information source for financial modeling with short-term data rather than a barrier in the conventional sense. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to illustrate our method further.

AB Though deep neural networks (DNNs) have revealed their extraordinary performance in the fields of computer vision, it is evident that the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks with crafted human-imperceptible perturbations. Most existing adversarial attacks draw their attention to invading target deep task models by enhancing input-diagnostic features via image rotation, warp, or transformation to improve adversarial transferability. Such manners pay close concentration to operation on original inputs regardless of the properties from different source information. Research has inspired us to consider utilizing source-agnostic information and integrating generated features with raw inputs to enrich adversarial properties. For such needs, we propose a simple and flexible adversarial attack method with source-agnostic Feature Inducing Method (FIM) for improving the transferability of adversarial examples (AEs). FIM first focuses on generating perturbed features by imitating diverse patterns from multi-domain sources. Instead of exploiting the original inputs' diversity, such proposed work gains the various properties by random feature imitation referring to different source distributions. By optimizing the generated features with norm bounds, FIM then integrates original inputs with imitative features. Such manner can diverse row positive class-general features, which reduce the capability of class-specific patterns on cross-model transferability. Based on the crafted property, FIM employs the adaptive gradient-based strategy on such information to generate perturbations, which helps to decrease probability dropping into local optimal when searching for the decision boundary of source and target models. We conduct detailed experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach with existing baselines on three public datasets. The experimental results reveal the better performance of the proposed works on fooling source and target task models leading to a considerable margin in most adversarial scenarios. We further investigate adversarial attacks on adversarial defense models (with adversarial training and trades). Such a proposed attack strategy achieves better attack quality by a margin over 3.00% on CIFAR10 and reduces the robust accuracy of adversarially trained models by a large margin near 9.00% on MNIST. Furthermore, we exploit the performance of the proposed attack strategy applied to feature-level adversarial domains and conduct evaluations to demonstrate its adversarial feasibility in integrating with various attack mechanisms, which gains better adversarial effectiveness over 20.00% than the base attacks on studied deep task models.

AB Multi-view spectral clustering has gained considerable attention due to its potential to enhance clustering performance. Although many methods have shown promising results, they often suffer from high time complexity and are not suitable for large-scale datasets. On the other hand, anchor-based methods are well-known for their efficiency. These methods typically learn the similarity relationship between instances and anchors and then convert it into the similarity relationship between instances, involving a considerable number of calculations. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Multi-view clustering via Efficient Representation LearnIng with aNchors (MERLIN) in this paper. Instead of learning the instance-instance relationship, MERLIN approaches the clustering problem from the perspective of representation learning. Specifically, MERLIN selects the same anchors for different views and utilizes these anchors to learn a consensus representation that integrates information from all views. Additionally, MERLIN adaptively learns weights for different views to fully exploit the complementary information among multiple views. In comparison with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods across five datasets, MERLIN demonstrates both efficiency and effectiveness in handling multi-view datasets and is suitable for handling large-scale datasets.

ID OBJECT RECOGNITION
AB Point cloud registration is a classic and fundamental problem. Existing point cloud registration methods obtain correspondence point pairs by calculating the correlation between point features. However, the instability of point features makes the outlier rate of corresponding point pairs high, resulting in poor matching results, especially when facing low overlap point clouds. An obvious fact is that patch matching has higher reliability than point matching. To this end, we propose a patch-guided point cloud registration network. Specifically, we perform fusion on patches and points at both the feature and result levels to achieve the guidance of patch to point matching and improve the accuracy of predicted point pairs. At the feature level, we propose a Matching Pyramid Network (MPN) for multi-level patch/point matching. The core of the MPN is an attention -based cross-layer context aggregation (CCA) module, which is used for the fusion of matching features between upper and lower layers. At the result level, we design a matching consistency judgment module to ensure that the point pairs are consistent in the matching of each layer, which greatly reduces the outlier ratio. Based on the above design, the corresponding point pairs predicted by our network have a high inlier ratio, which makes our method perform well in the face of low overlapping point clouds. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms other existing methods for indoor and outdoor datasets.

AB The design of organisations is a complex and laborious task. It is the subject of recent studies, which define models to automatically perform this task. However, existing models constrain the space of possible solutions by requiring a priori definitions of organisational roles and usually are not suitable for planning resource use. This paper presents GoOrg, a model that uses as input a set of goals and a set of available agents to generate different arrangements of organisational structures made up of synthesised organisational positions. The most distinguishing characteristics of GoOrg are the use of organisational positions instead of roles and that positions are automatically synthesised rather than required as a priori defined inputs. These characteristics facilitate the parametrisation, the use for resource planning and the chance of finding feasible solutions. This paper also introduces two model extensions, which define processes and constraints that illustrate how GoOrg suits different domains. Among aspects that surround an organisation design, this paper discusses models' input, agents' abstractions and resource planning.

AB There are many multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) in real life that contain a large number of decision variables, such as auto body parts design, financial investment, engineering design, adversarial textual attack and so on. These problems are known as large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs). Due to the curse of dimensionality, existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithm encounter difficulties in balancing convergence and diversity on LSMOPs. In this paper, a Population Cooperation based Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PCPSO) is proposed for tackling LSMOPs. To be specific, PCPSO is a two-stage optimizer with two key components: (1) In the first stage, an inter-population collaboration component named Auxiliary Population Cooperation (APC) is used to improve the convergence speed. (2) In the second stage, an intra-subpopulation collaboration component called SubPopulation Cooperation (SPC) is applied to balance convergence and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark problems with up to 5000 decision variables and 2, 3, 5, 10 objectives demonstrate that the proposed PCPSO achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs) on most test problems.

ID HANDLING METHOD
AB Convergence, diversity, and feasibility are crucial factors in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). Their imbalance can result in the algorithm failing to converge well to the Pareto front, especially when dealing with complex CMOPs. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive tradeoff evolutionary algorithm (ATEA), which can adjust the environment selection strategy based on the characteristics of problem, aiming to achieve a balance between convergence and diversity while ensuring feasibility of the population. The ATEA divides the search process into three phases: In the extended exploration phase, a global search is conducted using a guided constraint relaxation technique to enable the population to quickly traverse the infeasible region and approach the feasible region. In the tradeoff exploration phase, constraints are further detected and estimated to retain more feasible individuals and competing infeasible individuals, allowing the population to accurately identify all possible feasible regions and gradually expand towards the feasible boundary. The exploitation phase explores under-explored regions in the earlier phases with the aim of accelerating the convergence of the population and escaping from the local optima. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark test suites demonstrate that ATEA exhibits superior performance in three benchmark test suites compared with six other state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB We propose a fast stereo matching network based on temporal attention and 2D convolution (TANet). Due to the high similarity of the disparity between consecutive frames in an image sequence, we propose a temporal attention (TA) module that uses the disparity map of the previous frame to guide the disparity search range in the current frame, thus significantly improving the efficiency of disparity calculation in the cost volume module. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical cost construction and 2D convolution aggregation module that constructs a pyramid cost volume by fusing edge cues to establish detail constraints. This overcomes the problem of difficult convergence caused by information loss when replacing 3D convolution with 2D convolution. Experimental results show that the TA module effectively optimizes the cost volume and, together with 2D convolution, improves the computational speed. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, TANet achieves a speedup of nearly 4x, with a running time of 0.061s, and reduces the parameter count by nearly half while decreasing accuracy by 1.1%. Code is available at https://github.com/Y0uchenZ/TANet.

AB Integrating multi-view information to gain a new understanding of complex disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) has great clinical value. Hypergraphs have unique advantages in modeling high-order associations, but current deep learning methods cannot fully utilize the structural information in hypergraphs and have limited application value due to the black-box nature. This paper improves the hypergraph learning in interpretability and programmability. Firstly, we fuse multi-view information by constructing brain region-gene hypergraphs. Secondly, a characteristic information aggregation model is constructed based on hypergraph structure, Finally, a characteristic information aggregation hypergraph convolutional network (CIA-HGCN) is proposed based on the idea of graph neural networks. Evaluated by clinical imaging genetics data, CIA-HGCN obtained accuracy of 88.3% in AD identification task and showed superior performance in characteristic extraction. This paper provides a practical and flexible deep learning method for AD research and clinical applications.

ID 3-WAY DECISION
AB Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) is an emerging field for studying the representation and processing of knowledge embedded in data. Many efforts are focused on this field due to the interpretability and effectiveness of the formal concept (not pseudo concept). However, the standard CCL methods cannot tackle continuous data directly. Although the current fuzzy-based CCL (FCCL) is a straightforward approach to discovering the knowledge embedded in continuous data, it does not sufficiently utilize the native advantage of concepts in simulating the cognitive mechanism. Then it causes it to be incomplete and complex cognition. Inspired by the memory mechanism, this paper combines the recalling and forgetting mechanisms with CCL, called memory-based concept-cognitive learning (M-FCCL). Specifically, a cosine measure is introduced to describe the relationship of samples and construct cosine-similar granules to learn the concept. Subsequently, a fuzzy threeway concept based on the cosine similar granules is defined to represent and discover knowledge. Furthermore, two memory mechanisms are borrowed for the process of concept cognition for dynamic data classification and knowledge fusion: concept-recalling can enhance the effectiveness of concept learning, and concept-forgetting can effectively reduce the complexity of concept cognition. Finally, some experiments are compared with other methods on 16 benchmark datasets to show that M-FCCL achieves superior performance. Specifically, on these datasets, the proposed M-FCCL method achieves 17.02% and 18.54% classification accuracy gain compared with some advanced CCL mechanisms and popular classification methods.

ID LOW-RANK
AB Graph-based multi-view clustering has achieved better performance than most non-graph approaches. However, in many real-world scenarios, the graph structure of data is not given or the quality of initial graph is poor. Additionally, existing methods largely neglect the high-order neighborhood information that characterizes complex intrinsic interactions. To tackle these problems, we introduce an approach called high-order multi view clustering (HMvC) to explore the long-distance structural information of generic data. Firstly, graph filtering is applied to encode structure information, which unifies the processing of attributed graph data and non-graph data in a single framework. Secondly, up to infinity-order intrinsic relationships are exploited to enrich the learned graph. Thirdly, to explore the consistent and complementary information of various views, an adaptive graph fusion mechanism is proposed to achieve a consensus graph. Comprehensive experimental results on both non-graph and attributed graph data show the superior performance of our method with respect to various state-of-the-art techniques, including some deep learning methods.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research field that aims to recognize the user's sentiment information from multimodal data. The primary challenge in this field is to develop a high-quality fusion framework that effectively addresses the heterogeneity among different modalities. However, prior research has primarily concentrated on intermodal interactions while neglecting the semantic sentiment information conveyed by words in the text modality. In this paper, we propose the Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Attention Fusion Network (SKEAFN), a novel end-to-end fusion network that enhances multimodal fusion by incorporating additional sentiment knowledge representations from an external knowledge base. Firstly, we construct an external knowledge enhancement module to acquire additional representations for the text modality. Then, we design a text-guided interaction module that facilitates the interaction between text and the visual/acoustic modality. Finally, we propose a feature-wised attention fusion module that achieves multimodal fusion by dynamically adjusting the weights of the additional and each modality's representations. We evaluate our method on three challenging multimodal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and Twitter2019. The experiment results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/doubibobo/SKEAFN.

AB Reward tampering is a problem that will impact the trustworthiness of the powerful AI systems of the future. Reward Tampering describes the problem where AI agents bypass their intended objective, enabling unintended and potentially harmful behaviours. This paper investigates whether the creative potential of evolutionary algorithms could help ensure trustworthy solutions when facing this problem. The reason why evolutionary algorithms may help combat reward tampering is that they are able to find a diverse collection of different solutions to a problem within a single run, aiding the search for desirable solutions. Four different evolutionary algorithms were deployed in tasks illustrating the problem of reward tampering. The algorithms were designed with varying degrees of human expertise, measuring how human guidance influences the ability to discover trustworthy solutions. The results indicate that the algorithms' ability to find and preserve trustworthy solutions is very dependent on preserving diversity during the search. Algorithms searching for behavioural diversity showed to be the most effective against reward tampering. Human expertise also showed to improve the certainty and quality of safe solutions, but even with only a minimal degree of human expertise, domain-independent diversity management was found to discover safe solutions.

AB Max-sum is a version of belief propagation that was adapted for solving distributed constraint optimization problems. It has been studied theoretically and empirically, extended to versions that improve solution quality and converge rapidly, and is applicable to multiple distributed applications. The algorithm was presented both as synchronous and asynchronous algorithms. However, neither the differences in the performance of the two execution versions nor the implications of imperfect communication (i.e., massage delay and message loss) on the two versions have been investigated to the best of our knowledge. We contribute to the body of knowledge on Max-sum by: (1) Establishing the theoretical differences between the two execution versions of the algorithm, focusing on the construction of beliefs; (2) Empirically evaluating the differences between the solutions generated by the two versions of the algorithm, with and without message delay or loss; and (3) Establishing both theoretically and empirically the positive effect of damping on reducing the differences between the two versions. Our results indicate that, in contrast to recent published results indicating that message latency has a drastic (positive) effect on the performance of distributed local search algorithms, the effect of imperfect communication on Damped Max-sum (DMS) is minor. The version of Max-sum that includes both damping and splitting of function nodes converges to high quality solutions very fast, even when a large percentage of the messages sent by agents do not arrive at their destinations. Moreover, the quality of solutions in the different versions of DMS is dependent of the number of messages that were received by the agents, regardless of the amount of time they were delayed or if these messages are only a portion of the total number of messages that was sent by the agents.

AB Neuroscientists apply a range of analysis tools to recorded neural activity in order to glean insights into how neural circuits drive behavior in organisms. Despite the fact that these tools shape the progress of the field as a whole, we have little empirical proof that they are effective at identifying the mechanisms of interest. At the same time, deep learning systems are trained to produce intelligent behavior using neural networks, and the resulting models are impressive but also largely impenetrable. Can the tools of neuroscience be applied to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and if so what would this process tell us about ANNs, brains, and - most importantly - the tools themselves? Here we argue that applying analysis methods from neuroscience to ANNs will provide a much-needed test of the abilities of these tools. It would also encourage the development of a unified field of neural systems understanding, which can identify shared concepts and methods for studying distributed information processing in artificial and biological systems. To support this argument, we review methods commonly used in neuroscience, along with work that has demonstrated how these methods can be applied to ANNs and what we learn from this, and related efforts from interpretable AI.

AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) were created more than eighteen years ago with the aim of reducing accidents on public roads and saving lives. Achieving this goal depends on VANET mobiles exchanging Road State Information (RSI) with their surroundings and acting on the received RSI. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that transmitted messages are accurately received. This requires controlling the quality of the sharing medium or link while considering Channel State Information (CSI), which provides information on channel quality and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The process of adjusting the payload based on the CSI is known as Link Adaptation (LA). While several LA works have been published in VANETs, few have considered the effect of relative node mobility. This work presents a link adaptation strategy for VANETs that uses a Neural Network (NN) and the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA). While accounting for the Doppler Shift effect induced by the relative velocity, the simulation results demonstrate that the NN approach outperforms its peers by 77%, 115% and 853% in terms of transmitted errors, model efficiency, and throughput respectively, compared to the Cte, ARF, and AMC algorithms.

   Relation Extraction.
AB Ontology is a form of structured knowledge representation. Ontology is largely used and developed in the process of information retrieval because of its ability to represent knowledge in a form that is both understandable by machine and human. With the increase of ontology scale and complexity is a greater challenge in extra-logical error identification. Most ontological engineering methods depend on machine learning where there is a risk of overlooking extra-logical error. One way to handle this is by crowdsourcing, that is dividing a large task into several smaller subtasks and employ the mass to complete them online. To utilise crowdsourcing, we change the offline and batch data processing into the online and incremental one. Online incremental learning constructs a model in an iterative manner right after a change is made, ensuring that previously acquired knowledge is maintained. The crowdsourcing participants will be asked to repeatedly validate those relations until the desired accuracy value is reached. From this research, we find that crowdsourcing is able to improve the model used in relation extraction process, from the F1-Score of 87.2 % to 89.8 %. This improvement using crowdsourcing reaches the same score as that using expert. Therefore, crowdsourcing is considered as able to correct extra-logical error accurately, just like expert. Besides, we also discover that offline incremental learning using Random Forest produces a model with higher accuracy than online incremental learning using Mondrian Forest. Random Forest model has the final accuracy value of 90.6 % while Mondrian Forest model has 89.7 %. From this result, we conclude that online incremental learning is unable to produce a better result than offline incremental learning in improving meronymy relation extraction process.

AB Pneumonia, also known as bronchitis, is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Pneumonia can be fatal to an infected person because the lungs cannot exchange air. The disease primarily affects infants and people over the age of 65. Every year, nearly 4 million people are killed by the disease, affecting an estimated 420 million people. Detecting and diagnosing the condition as soon as possible is also critical. Diagnosing the condition using the patient's X-ray is the most effective method. Experienced radiologists will use a chest x-ray of the affected patient to make an informed decision. Recently, coronavirus has been a contagious viral disease caused by the SARSCoV2 virus and affects the human respiratory system. The virus also causes pneumonia (COVID pneumonia), which is far more dangerous than ordinary pneumonia. The primary purpose of the work is to study and compare several deep-learning enhancement techniques applied to medical x-ray, and CT scan images to detect COVID-19 (pneumonia).A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to design a model that can distinguish between COVID-19 pneumonia and ordinary pneumonia. In addition, image enhancement techniques (Histogram Equalization (HE), and Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) have been processed against the dataset to find more efficient methods and models for detecting pneumonia. A dataset of 6432 CXRs was used -576 COVID pneumonia CXRs, 1583 ordinary pneumonia CXRs, and 4273 healthy lung CXRs. The proposed results proved that the equalized histogram and the equalized dataset of CLAHE run faster than the original dataset. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is influenced by the framework that can distinguish between COVID pneumonia, ordinary pneumonia, and healthy lungs. In addition, the improved VGG16 achieved 96% accuracy in detecting X-ray images of COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI Attribute subspaces for zero-shot learning

DE Zero-shot learning; Attribute localization; Subspace representation;
   Attribute subspaces; Self-supervised learning
AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen categories without corresponding training samples, which is a practical yet challenging task in computer vision and pattern recognition community. Current state-of-the-art locality-based ZSL methods aim to learn the explicit locality of discriminative attributes, which may suffer from insufficient class-level attribute supervision. In this paper, we introduce an Attribute Subspace learning method for ZSL (AS-ZSL) to learn implicit attribute composition, which is more general than attribute localization with only class-level attribute supervision. AS-ZSL exploits subspace representations that can effectively capture the intrinsic composition of high-dimensional image features and the diversity within attribute appearance. Furthermore, we develop a subspace distance based triplet loss to improve the distinguishability of the attribute subspace representation. Attribute subspace learning module is only needed for the training phase to jointly learn discriminative global features. This leads to a compact inference phase. Furthermore, the proposed AS-ZSL can be naturally extended to adapt to the transductive ZSL setting using a novel self-supervised training strategy. Extensive experimental results on several widely used ZSL datasets, i.e., CUB, AwA2, and SUN, demonstrate the advantage of AS-ZSL compared with the state-of-the-art under different ZSL settings.

AB Production and distribution are two parts of importance in supply chains. Yet, seldom attention is given to an integrated production and distribution in the case of open shop scheduling and vehicle routing problems. This article addresses an integrated scheduling problem of open shop and vehicle routing optimization, in which the jobs are processed in an open shop, and subsequently are delivered to customers at diverse places. First, a mixed integer programming model is developed to define the problem with minimizing maximum completion time. Second, an ensemble of group teaching optimization and simulated annealing methods is devised to optimally handle the considered problem. A heuristic rule is designed to generate a high-quality initial solution, while a simulated annealing method considering key machines is proposed to reinforce exploitation abilities. A nearest insertion method is used to make delivery decisions of vehicles. At last, the sensitivity analysis of user parameters in the developed approach is executed. Via solving a set of benchmark instances, we carry out extensive comparison experiments. The formulated model is verified by a mathematical programming optimizer CPLEX and the devised approach is compared with four meta-heuristics. The results and discussions confirm the strong competitiveness of the developed model and method for solving the concerned problems.

AB The available method based on statistical principles for aggregating hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) possibility distribution is the N-two-stage algorithmic aggregation paradigm driven by the K-means clustering (N2S-KMC). Nonetheless, the N2S-KMC method is subject to two significant limitations. (i) The grouping technique is capable of effectively partitioning decision-making information into N groups. However, it does not determine the appropriate placement of members within each group, as the number of computations is dependent on the number of elements present in each group, rather than the elements themselves. (ii) The initial clustering centers of K-means clustering are chosen without adhering to the distribution law within the aggregated hesitant 2-tuple linguistic terms set (H2TLTS) possibility distribution. This may result in a reduction in the clustering performance. In order to address the aforementioned limitations, we suggest two enhancement techniques for the former. Firstly, we propose the utilization of the minimum average difference (MAD) method to ascertain the number of groups. This approach aims to reduce the time required for the initial stage of aggregation following grouping. Secondly, we recommend the implementation of the maximize compactness degree of inter-group grouping (MCDIGG) method. This method enables the identification of group members, resulting in a more concentrated distribution of data subsequent to grouping. The present study suggests the utilization of MAD and MCDIGG techniques as a substitute for the grouping approach in the N2S-KMC model. This leads to the development of a new algorithm, IN2S-DO-KMC, wherein the data is partitioned into K subsets in a descending order to determine the initial center for KMC. Furthermore, with respect to the issue present in the subsequent phase, we propose the utilization of the density canopy (DC) algorithm to perform pre-clustering of the data and produce the initial clustering center and the quantity of clusters for the K- means algorithm. Subsequently, a refined version of the N2S-KMC model, denoted as IN2S-DC-KMC, has been suggested. Ultimately, an empirical study is conducted to assess the validity and practicability of the proposed framework for evaluating failure modes in medical devices. The outcomes are evaluated with regards to the efficacy of the algorithm, the numerical dispersion, and the pragmatic ramifications.

AB Backdoor watermarking is a promising paradigm to protect the copyright of deep neural network (DNN) models. In the existing works on this subject, researchers have intensively focused on watermarking robustness, while the concept of fidelity, which is concerned with the preservation of the model's original functionality, has received less attention. In this paper, focusing on deep image classification models, we show that the existing shared notion of the sole measurement of learning accuracy is inadequate to characterize backdoor fidelity. Meanwhile, we show that the analogous concept of embedding distortion in multimedia watermarking, interpreted as the total weight loss (TWL) in DNN backdoor watermarking, is also problematic for fidelity measurement. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of deep fidelity, which states that the backdoor watermarked DNN model should preserve both the feature representation and decision boundary of the unwatermarked host model. To achieve deep fidelity, we propose two loss functions termed penultimate feature loss (PFL) and softmax probability-distribution loss (SPL) to preserve feature representation, while the decision boundary is preserved by the proposed fix last layer (FixLL) treatment, inspired by the recent discovery that deep learning with a fixed classifier causes no loss of learning accuracy. With the above designs, both embedding from scratch and fine-tuning strategies are implemented to evaluate the deep fidelity of backdoor embedding, whose advantages over the existing methods are verified via experiments using ResNet18 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifications, and wide residual network (i.e., WRN28_10) for CIFAR-100 task.

AB Domain adaptation is an important task for medical image analysis to improve generalization on datasets collected from diverse institutes using different scanners and protocols. For images with visible domain shift, using image translation models is an intuitive and effective way to perform domain adaptation, but the structure of the generated image may often be distorted when large content discrepancies between domains exist; resulting in poor downstream task performance. To address this, we propose a novel image translation model that disentangles structure and texture to only transfer the latter by using mutual information and texture co-occurrence losses. We translate source domain images to the target domain and employ the generated results as augmented samples for domain adaptation segmentation training. We evaluate our method on three public segmentation datasets: MMWHS, Fundus, and Prostate datasets acquired from diverse institutes. Experimental results show that a segmentation model trained using the augmented images from our approach outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation, image translation, and domain generalization methods.

AB With the explosive growth of online information, the significant application value of recommender systems has received considerable attention. Since user-item interactions can naturally fit into graph structure data, graph neural networks (GNNs), by virtue of their strong ability in graph representation learning, have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. Recently, GNN-based contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have received careful attention due to their superiority over graph-based recommendation under the typical supervised learning paradigm. However, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, GNN-based recommendation with SSL often needs a huge amount of negative examples and the model's performance is heavily dependent on complex data augmentations. Also, the information interaction among various augmented views is often performed under a single perspective (e.g., structure/feature space or node/graph level). In this paper, we propose a novel bootstrapped graph representation learning with local and global regularization for recommendation, i.e., BLoG, which constructs positive/negative pairs based on the aggregated node features by referring to two alternate views of the original user-item graph structure. In particular, BLoG learns user- item representations by encoding two augmented versions of a user-item bipartite graph using two separate encoders: an online encoder and a target encoder. To facilitate the information interaction between these two distinct graph encoders, we introduce local and global regularization for recommendation, where a graph structural contrastive loss and a node-level semantic loss are defined for local regularization while a graph-level contrastive loss is used for global regularization. An alternative optimization approach is used to train the online encoder and the target encoder. Experimental studies on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that BLoG achieves better recommendation accuracy than several existing baselines.

AB Spiking neural networks are efficient computation models for low-power environments. Spike-based BP algorithms and ANN-to-SNN (ANN2SNN) conversions are successful techniques for SNN training. Nevertheless, the spike-base BP training is slow and requires large memory costs, while ANN2SNN needs many inference steps to obtain good performance. In this paper, we propose an Activation Consistency Coupled ANN-SNN (AC2AS) framework to train the SNN in a fast and memory-efficient way. The AC2AS consists of two components: (a) a weight-shared architecture between ANN and SNN and (b) spiking mapping units. Firstly, the architecture trains the weight-shared parameters on the ANN branch, resulting in fast training and low memory costs for SNN. Secondly, the spiking mapping units are designed to ensure that the activation values of the ANN are the spiking features. As a result, the activation consistency is guaranteed, and the classification error of the SNN can be optimized by training the ANN branch. Besides, we design an adaptive threshold adjustment (ATA) algorithm to decrease the firing of noisy spikes. Experiment results show that our AC2AS-based models perform well on the benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet). Moreover, the AC2AS achieves comparable accuracy under 0.625x time steps, 0.377x training time, 0.27x GPU memory costs, and 0.33x spike activities of the Spike-based BP model. The code is available at https://github.com/TJXTT/AC2ASNN.

   Generalization
AB Data augmentation has been an essential technique for improving the generalization ability of deep neural networks in image classification tasks. However, intensive changes in appearance and different degrees of occlusion in images are the key factors that severely affect the generalization ability of image classification models. Therefore, in order to enhance the generalization performance and robustness of deep models, data augmentation approaches by providing models with more diverse training data in various scenarios are widely applied. Although many existing data augmentation methods simulate occlusion in the augmented images to enhance the generalization of models, these methods randomly delete some areas in images without considering the semantic information of images. In this work, we propose a novel data augmentation method named AdvMask for image classification based on sparse adversarial attack techniques. AdvMask first identifies the key points that have the greatest influence on the classification results via a proposed end-to-end sparse adversarial attack module. During the data augmentation process, AdvMask efficiently generates diverse augmented data with structured occlusions based on the key points. By doing so, AdvMask can force deep models to seek other relevant content while the most discriminative content is hidden. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets and deep models demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively improve the generalization performance of deep models and significantly outperforms previous data augmentation methods. Code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/Jackbrocp/AdvMask.

ID ENTITY ALIGNMENT
AB Knowledge graph (KG) is a kind of structured human knowledge of modeling the relationships between real-world entities. High quality KG is of crucial importance for many knowledge-based applications, e.g., question answering, recommender systems, etc. This paper studies the problem of entity alignment in KGs to promote knowledge fusion. Existing methods model the semantic representation of entities by using graph structural information or attribute information of the KG and then align the entities across different domains by calculating the distances between entities' embeddings. However, these methods only consider the node to-node similarity in the alignment procedure while the edge-to-edge similarity is ignored. Our research hypothesis is that the graph edge alignment information is critical in entity alignment. We reformulate the knowledge entity alignment as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) by adding relation alignment under the one-to-one mapping constraint. To solve the notorious QAP in a large-scale heterogeneous graph like KG, we propose a model, dual neighborhood consensus network (DNCN), which approximately decomposes the QAP into two small-scale linear assignment problems, i.e., entity alignment and relation alignment. After that, an edge-coloring propagation method is proposed to refine the coarse entity alignment result using the relation correspondence. Theoretical proof shows that this method can guarantee the isomorphism between local sub graphs. The performance of DNCN is evaluated using the DBP15K and DWY100K benchmarks. Experimental results show that DNCN achieves the best performance on the DBP15K benchmark, and is computationally efficient. Ablation studies verify the importance of graph edge alignment information.

AB Medical images are fundamentally utilized for rendering diagnostic and treatment to patients. Medical images are a patient body or part captured using medical imaging devices such as CT, X-Ray, PET, MRI, and US. Technological advancement introduces E-Healthcare systems, Telemedicine, and Electronic Health Information Systems (EHIS) enabling medical images to flow over the public network for remote healthcare services. The manipulation or replacement of medical images is fatal to the well-being of a patient, thereby requiring protection using watermarking. Watermarking is a data security approach toward protecting medical images against abuse by unauthorized personnel via providing confidentiality, authentication, and integrity verification. The dynamism and importance of medical image watermarking require constant literature update on trends, issues, and challenges which leading to the forgoing research survey. The survey proposes to highlight trending application areas in medical image watermarking research and evaluation of the recent approach adopted by researchers. Furthermore, the survey evaluates existing work in compliance with the standard benchmark requirement in design and performance and presents a discussion on the way forward to other possible research opportunities in the medical image watermarking domain.

DE Semi-supervised learning; Transfer learning; Fine-tuning; Deep learning;
   Hierarchical consistency; Adaptive sample selection
AB Both semi-supervised learning and transfer learning aim at lowering the annotation burden for training models. However, such two tasks are usually studied separately, i.e. most semi-supervised learning algorithms train models from scratch while transfer learning assumes pre-trained models as the initialization. In this work, we focus on a previously-less-concerned setting that further reduces the annotation efforts through incorporating both semi-supervised and transfer learning, where specifically a pre-trained source model is used as the initialization of semi-supervised learning. As those powerful pre-trained models are ubiquitously available nowadays and can considerably benefit various down-streaming tasks, such a setting is relevant to real-world applications yet challenging to design effective algorithms.Aiming at enabling transfer learning under semi-supervised settings, we propose a hierarchical self regularization mechanism to exploit unlabeled samples more effectively, where a novel self-regularizer has been introduced to incorporate both individual-level and population-level regularization terms. The former term employs self-distillation to regularize learned deep features for each individual sample, and the latter one enforces self-consistency on feature distributions between labeled and unlabeled samples. Samples involved in both regularizers are weighted by an adaptive strategy, where self-regularization effects of both terms are adaptively controlled by the confidence of every sample. To validate our algorithm, exhaustive experiments have been conducted on diverse datasets such as CIFAR-10 for general object recognition, CUB200-2011/MIT-indoor-67 for fine-grained classification and MURA for medical image classification. Compared with state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods including Pseudo Label, Mean Teacher, MixMatch and FixMatch, our algorithm demonstrates two advantages: first of all, the proposed approach adopts a new point of view to tackle problems caused by inadequate supervision and achieves very competitive results; then, it is complementary to these state-of-the-art methods and thus can be combined with them to get additional improvements. Furthermore, our method can also be applied to fully supervised transfer learning and self supervised learning. We have published our code at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Semi-Supervised-TransferLearning.

AB The counting-based questions play a major part in Visual Question Answering (VQA), the most challenging factor is counting the different objects present in the images. Recently more attention is paid to design a model of count aided VQA. Based on the questions, the VQA system responds with appropriate answers. Yet, the complex questions are necessitating in the system with answers. The earlier models are still facing the challenging problems of counting the various objects within the images as the models become futile to select the features and lack fine-grained representation. In order to sustain the image representation, this paper proposes a new model for VQA using the heuristic approach of serial cascaded deep learning methods. Initially, the standard data regarding images and text data are gathered and fed to the pre-processing process. Consequently, the feature extraction is done on both the image and the text data. Here, the deep features from images are taken using Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) and the text features are extracted using Text Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN). Then, the optimal weighted fused features are obtained, where the weights used for getting the necessary features are tuned via the Improved Tuna Swarm Optimization (ITSO) algorithm. Finally, the counting answers are retrieved based on the given queries, which is carried out via Serial Cascaded Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory (SCRAM-LSTM). The performance is examined with divergent metrics compared with conventional models. Hence, the findings reveal that it offers superior performance in estimating the appropriate answers. Therefore, the proposed work is widely used for such potential applications as helping blind or visually impaired people to get information, integrating with image retrieval systems, and also for search engines. Especially, it is utilized for the vision and language systems.

AB Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an emerging solution to design a lightweight network for researchers to obtain a trade-off between accuracy and speed, releasing researchers from tedious repeated trials. However, the main shortcoming of NAS is its high and unstable memory consumption of the search work, especially for large-scale tasks. In this study, the proposed Asymptotic Neural Architecture Search network (ANAS) achieved a proxyless search for large-scale tasks with economic and stable memory consumption. Instead of proxy search like other NAS algorithms, ANAS achieved the large-scale proxyless search that directly learns deep neural network architecture for target task. ANAS reduced the peak value of memory consumption by an asymptotic method, and kept the memory consumption stable by the linkage change of a series of key indexes. A pruning operation and efficient candidate operations decreased the total memory consumption. Finally, ANAS achieved a good trade-off between accuracy and speed for classification tasks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. Besides, except for the classification task, it achieved excellent multi-task transfer learning ability for implementing the segmentation task on CamVid and Cityscapes. ANAS reached 22.8% test errs with 5 M parameter on ImageNet, and 72.9 mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) with 119.9 FPS (Frames Per Second) on Cityscapes dataset.

AB With the rapid advancement of big data technology, high-dimensional datasets comprising multi-label data have become prevalent in various fields. However, these datasets often contain more relevant and redundant features, which can adversely affect the performance of machine learning algorithms. Multi-label feature selection (MLFS) has emerged as a crucial pre-processing step in multi-label learning to address this issue. This survey provides an overview of multi-label learning and its algorithms, including problem transformation and algorithm adaptation. We also introduced three traditional strategies for MLFS: filter, wrapper, and embedded-based methods. Furthermore, we categorize existing research on multi-label feature selection into six aspects based on label fusion: label transformation-based (Binary Relevance-based and Label Powerset-based), label correlation-based (second and high-order, high and hybrid order), label specific-based, semi-supervised -learning-based, missing and noisy labels-based, and label enhancement-based approaches. We provide a detailed introduction to each method's common approaches and theories. Additionally, we conduct experimental comparisons on practical multi-label learning datasets to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms. We discuss the application of multi-label feature selection in various domains, such as data mining, computer vision, natural language processing, and bio-informatics. Finally, we outline potential future research directions in multi-label feature selection, including MLFS with online learning, active learning, label distribution learning, partial label learning, granular computing, and class-imbalanced learning.

AB Recent days witness significant progress in various multi-modal tasks made by Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a multi-modal large-scale model that learns visual representations from natural language supervision. However, the potential effects of CLIP on cross-modal hashing retrieval has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we for the first time explore the effects of CLIP on cross-modal hashing retrieval performance and propose a simple but strong baseline Unsupervised Contrastive Multi-modal Fusion Hashing network (UCMFH). We first extract the off-the-shelf visual and linguistic features from the CLIP model, as the input sources for cross-modal hashing functions. To further mitigate the semantic gap between the image and text features, we design an effective contrastive multi-modal learning module that leverages a multi modal fusion transformer encoder supervising by a contrastive loss, to enhance modality interaction while improving the semantic representation of each modality. Furthermore, we design a contrastive hash learning module to produce high-quality modal-correlated hash codes. Experiments show that significant performance improvement can be made by our simple new unsupervised baseline UCMFH compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods. Also, our experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of CLIP features on cross-modal hashing retrieval task compared to deep visual and linguistic features used in existing state-of-the-art methods. The source codes for our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/XinyuXia97/UCMFH.

AB Existing multi-view object classification algorithms usually rely on sufficient labeled multi-view objects, which substantially restricts their scalability to novel classes with few annotated training samples in real-world applications. Aiming to go beyond these limitations, we explore a novel yet challenging task, few-shot multi -view object classification (FS-MVOC), which expects the network to build its classification ability efficiently based on limited labeled multi-view objects. To this end, we design a dual augmentation network (DANet) to provide excellent performance for the under-explored FS-MVOC task. On the one hand, we employ an attention -guided multi-view representation augmentation (AMRA) strategy to help the model focus on salient features and suppress unnecessary ones on multiple views of multi-view objects, resulting in more discriminative multi -view representations. On the other hand, during the meta-training stage, we adopt the category prototype augmentation (CPA) strategy to improve the class-representativeness of each prototype and increase the inter -prototype difference by injecting Gaussian noise in the deep feature space. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets (Meta-ModelNet and Meta-ShapeNet) indicate the effectiveness and robustness of DANet.

AB The videos captured by the surveillance equipment in sand-dust weather will have poor visibility, color distortion, and low contrast, and the performance of surveillance systems is seriously interfered. To solve this problem, a real-time quality improvement method based on an adaptive dynamic screened Poisson equation for surveillance video in sand-dust weather is proposed in the paper. In the proposed method, the surveillance video collected in sand-dust weather is first divided into several segments using a keyframe extraction method, and then each segment of the surveillance video is processed according to the frame difference strategy to obtain the enhanced surveillance video. There are three steps in processing surveillance video segments, one is to extract the background frame using a multi-frame averaging method, the second is to enhance the background frame using an automatically improving frame quality method based on screened Poisson equation, and the third is to use the enhanced background image and the frame difference information to obtain the enhancement result of the frame image to be processed. Through qualitative and quantitative comprehensive experiments on sand-dust images and videos, the experimental results are compared with the existing related methods, the results of processing sand-dust images using our improving frame quality method have the best visual effect and the highest total scores in quantitative analysis. The results of the frame difference strategy show an average 11.36x speed up as compared with the framewise quality improvement method and realize the goal of real-time processing surveillance video.

DE Multi-view stereo; Depth estimation; Adaptive range; Adaptive interval
AB Multi-View Stereo (MVS) is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision which aims to reconstruct a scene using multi-view images with known camera parameters. However, the mainstream approaches represent the scene with a fixed all-pixel depth range and equal depth interval partition, which will result in inadequate utilization of depth planes and imprecise depth estimation. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stage coarse to-fine framework to achieve adaptive all-pixel depth range and depth interval. We predict a coarse depth map in the first stage, then an Adaptive Depth Range Prediction module is proposed in the second stage to zoom in the scene by leveraging the reference image and the obtained depth map in the first stage and predict a more accurate all-pixel depth range for the following stages. In the third and fourth stages, we propose an Adaptive Depth Interval Adjustment module to achieve adaptive variable interval partition for pixel-wise depth range. The depth interval distribution in this module is normalized by Z-score, which can allocate dense depth hypothesis planes around the potential ground truth depth value and vice versa to achieve more accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets (DTU, TnT, BlendedMVS, ETH 3D) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields competitive generalization ability. Particularly, our method achieves the highest Acc and Overall on the DTU dataset, while attaining the highest Recall and F1-score on the Tanks and Temples intermediate and advanced dataset. Moreover, our method also achieves the lowest e1 and e3 on the BlendedMVS dataset and the highest Acc and F1-score on the ETH 3D dataset, surpassing all listed methods.

ID DEPENDENCY DISCOVERY
AB Data integration is the problem of consolidating information provided by multiple sources. After schema mapping and duplicate detection have been dealt with, the problem consists in fusing disparate data that comes from the sources. In this work, we treat this problem as a data cleaning problem where consistency within and between sources is modelled by respectively edit rules and a partial key. The combination of these constraints leads to the definition of edit rules under a partial key (EPKs). We show that we can adapt the well-known set cover method for edit rules to the setting of EPKs and this yields an efficient algorithm to find minimal-cost repairs. These repairs then provide solutions for the initial data fusion problem. The methodology is implemented in a repair engine called Parker. Empirical results show that Parker is several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art repair tools. At the same time, the quality of the repairs in terms of F1-score ranges from comparable to better compared to these tools.

AB Recently, various fully supervised learning methods are successfully applied for lung CT image segmentation. However, pixel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and labor-intensive, but the performance of unsupervised learning methods are failed to meet the demands of practical applications. To achieve a reasonable trade-off between the performance and label dependency, a novel weakly supervised inpaintingbased learning method is introduced, in which only bounding box labels are required for accurate segmentation. Specifically, lesion regions are first detected by an object detection network, then we crop them out of the input image and recover the missing holes to normal regions using a progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN). Finally, a post-processing method is designed to get the accurate segmentation mask from the difference image of input and recovered images. In addition, real information (i.e., number, location and size) of the bounding boxes of lesions from the dataset guides us to make the training dataset for PCIN. We apply a multi-scale supervised strategy to train PCIN for a progressive and stable inpainting. Moreover, to remove the visual artifacts resulted from the invalid features of missing holes, an initial patch generation network (IPGN) is proposed for holes initialization with generated pseudo healthy image patches. Experiments on the public COVID-19 dataset demonstrate that PCIN is outstanding in lung CT images inpainting, and the performance of our proposed weakly supervised method is comparable to fully supervised methods.

AB The recognition and detection of multioriented text from textual natural scene images are still challenging in the computer vision community. The segmentation on either word level or character level is a vital step in the entire end-to-end performance of the scene text recognition system. Many academicians and researchers have done work in the prominent field of segmenting the words or characters from complex document images as well as handwritten images for various non-Indian scripts. In this paper, we extensively presented a deep learning-based architecture named DELIGHT-Net which is derived from the general UNet architecture to segment the text at the word level from natural scene images. The method is mainly proposed to segment the Devanagari, Gurumukhi, and English scenic words from complete images collected from day-to-day life. To achieve this, we have introduced a new dataset, i.e., National Institute of Technology Jalandhar-Word Segmentation (NITJ-WS) which has around 2200 text blocks extracted from 1500 natural images containing unilingual, bilingual, and trilingual text. The benchmark comparative assessment of our dataset is performed with the proposed model and two state-of-the-art models, i.e., UNet and ResUNet. Statistical and visual results are evaluated using different evaluation parameters, which depict the efficiency of the proposed model. Some possible future directions are also recommended in the manuscript. We hope that our work is a stepping stone for academicians in the field of natural scene text recognition.

As a nonverbal biological feature, gait plays a significant role in this field, owing to its resistance to manipulation or replication. In this paper, we propose a gait-based emotion perception framework called Dependency-Difference Gait (DDG), which can extract emotional features from gait patterns comprehensively and efficiently. We also introduce a method of spatial-temporal difference representation, which constructs the static spatial difference information within frames and dynamic temporal difference information between frames. We abstract these details as difference information and fuse them with the dependency information extracted from the original sequence. Our approach not only breaks the limitations of hand-crafted features, but also enables the extraction of a broader spectrum of emotional features. Additionally, we present the Emotional Information Attention (EIA) mechanism, allowing DDG to focus on key joints and frames based on the quantity of emotional information. Experimental and visualization results substantiate the effectiveness of the DDG and EIA. In the quality analysis, we find that selecting a few number of joints with a substantial amount of emotional information is beneficial for emotion classification. However, selecting a few frames can disrupt the temporal structure of the sequence, resulting in suboptimal performance.

AB The rapid development and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have made the development of AI-specific design methods an important topic to advance. In recent decades, the centre of gravity in AI has shifted away from cognitive science and related fields like psychology. However, there is a clear need and potential for added value in returning to stronger interaction. One potential challenge for this interaction may be the lack of common conceptual grounds and design languages.In this article, we aim to contribute to the development of conceptual interfaces for human-based AI-specific design methods through the idea of cognitive mimetics. We begin by introducing basic concepts from mimetic design and interpret them in the context of this thematic area. These provide some of the basic building blocks for a design language and bring to the surface key questions. These in turn provide a ground for explicating cognitive mimetics. In the second part of this paper, we focus on specifying a key aspect in cognitive mimetics: the contents of information processes.Others engaged in this field can derive value from using or developing the basic conceptual machinery to specify their own approaches in this interdisciplinary field that is still shaping itself. Furthermore, those who resonate with the idea of cognitive mimetics, as specified here, can join in taking this particular approach further.

AB Object detection is a fundamental function of many intelligent autonomous systems such as service robots or autonomous vehicles. State-of-the-art 3D object detection methods are deep learning methods which require large amounts of annotated data for successful training. Acquiring and labeling real-world data is an expensive and time-consuming task. An alternative is to train object detectors using synthetically generated images. Since modern object detectors trained on synthetic data still do not achieve similar results to those trained on real data, generating realistic synthetic data is still an open issue. We address the problem of object detection in indoor environments based on 3D point clouds acquired by 3D cameras. We provide a detailed insight into the importance of five factors involved in generating synthetic data: camera noise, presence of background objects, positioning of objects, scene context, and object sizes. To investigate the importance of these factors, we have developed a fully modular method for generating realistic synthetic single-view point clouds for training object detectors. Our method can generate large amounts of customizable data in a short time. An interesting finding is that pre-training with our data and fine-tuning with real data improves the performance of 3D object detectors, enabling one of them to achieve state-of-the-art results on one of the benchmarks without the use of RGB data.

ID SEX-DIFFERENCES; DISEASE
AB Deep neural networks have shown promise in predicting the chronological age of a healthy brain using T1weighted magnetic resonance images (T1 MRIs). This predicted brain age has the potential to serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying development-related and aging-related disorders. In this study, we propose the Optimal Transport based Feature Pyramid Fusion (OTFPF) network for estimating brain age using T1 MRIs. The OTFPF network comprises three key modules: the Optimal Transport based Feature Pyramid Fusion (OTFPF) module, the 3D overlapped ConvNeXt (3D OL-ConvNeXt) module, and the fusion module. These modules enhance the OTFPF network's ability to comprehend the semi-multimodal and multi-level feature pyramid information of each brain, thereby improving its understanding of brain development and aging. Compared to recent state-of-the-art models, the proposed OTFPF network demonstrates faster convergence, superior performance, and enhanced interpretability. Experimental results utilizing a dataset of 12,909 MRIs from individuals aged 3-97 years demonstrate the accurate estimation of brain age by the OTFPF network, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.846, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.9941, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9802. Thorough parameter evaluations, quantitative comparison experiments, dataset-scale evaluations, cross-validations, and ablation studies convincingly demonstrate the stability, interpretability, and superiority of the OTFPF network. According to the OTFPF network, the age-related heatmaps of the brain explain the biological mechanisms underlying brain aging. Furthermore, the OTFPF network is applied to analyze datasets associated with brain disorders, effectively demonstrating its practical utility.

AB Anomaly detection aims to identify observations that differ significantly from the majority of the data. Time series, which are data with a temporal component, is often used for anomaly detection. Identifying anomalies is not perfect and may produce many false positives, which labels standard data as anomalous. In this context, false positive mitigation is the task of reducing the number of false positives tagged by the anomaly detector, and thus both problems are closely linked. Moreover, current techniques for false positive mitigation are ad -hoc solutions for specific data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage methodology for Multivariate Anomaly Detection for Time Series and False Positive Mitigation, namely FADFPM methodology, which creates the fusion of two learning models. The first stage is a multivariate anomaly detection stage. The second stage consists of training a new classifier on the false and true positives from the anomaly detector, which refines the observations labeled as anomalous by the anomaly detector to obtain more accurate and higher-quality results. Experiments using two benchmark data sets, as well as a real-world case study have shown the performance and validity of the proposal.

DE Fair division; Indivisible chores; Price of fairness
ID ASSIGNMENT; DIVISION
AB We study several fairness notions in allocating indivisible chores (i.e., items with disutilities) to agents who have additive and submodular cost functions. The fairness criteria we are concerned with are envy-free up to any item, envy-free up to one item, maximin share (MMS), and pairwise maximin share (PMMS), which are proposed as relaxations of envy-freeness in the setting of additive cost functions. For allocations under each fairness criterion, we establish their approximation guarantee for other fairness criteria. Under the additive setting, our results show strong connections between these fairness criteria and, at the same time, reveal intrinsic differences between goods allocation and chores allocation. However, such strong relationships cannot be inherited by the submodular setting, under which PMMS and MMS are no longer relaxations of envy-freeness and, even worse, few non-trivial guarantees exist. We also investigate efficiency loss under these fairness constraints and establish their prices of fairness.

AB This paper introduces an l(1)-norm model based on Total Variation Minimization for tomographic reconstruction. The reconstructions produced by the proposed model are more accurate than those obtained with classical reconstruction models based on the l(2)-norm. This model can be linearized and solved by linear programming techniques. Furthermore, the complementary slackness conditions can be exploited to reduce the dimension of the resulting formulation by removing unnecessary variables and constraints. Since the efficacy of the reduced formulation strongly depends on the quality of the dual-multipliers used when applying the reduction method, Lagrangian relaxation is used to obtain near-optimal multipliers. This allows solving larger instances in an efficient way.

AB Precise suspended sediment load (SSL) prediction is essential for irrigation, hydropower and river management practices. But due to some external factors such as high altitude, heavy monsoon and tropical climate conditions, the data we collect may contain noisy samples. Hence, it becomes a challenging task to accurately predict the SSL in rivers. Therefore, to diminish the influence of noise, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) -based techniques can be adopted. Moreover, the large margin distribution machine-based regression (LDMR) can deal efficiently with noisy datasets as it simultaneously minimizes the insensitive loss as well as quadratic loss. The significance of this work lies in its contribution to improving the accuracy of suspended sediment load (SSL) prediction in rivers, which has practical implications for various applications such as irrigation, hydropower, and river management. We recognize the challenges posed by external factors, which introduce noise into the collected data, making accurate prediction of SSL difficult. Overall, the significance of this work lies in its novel integration of EMD-based techniques and LDMR-based models, which address the challenges posed by noisy and non-stationary sediment load data. The findings contribute to the field of SSL prediction, offering practical solutions for managing and utilizing river resources more effectively in various domains. The main advantage of the least squares LDMR (LS-LDMR) approach is that it solves a system of linear equations rather than solving a large QPPs unlike SVR, TSVR, LDMR, which makes it computationally efficient. It is well known that the sediment load data is complex and non-stationary in nature. Therefore, for daily SSL prediction, the LDMR and least squares LDMR (LSLDMR) models are embedded with two different decomposition techniques, EMD and ensemble EMD (EEMD), to handle the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of sediment load data on the forecasted outputs and to increase prediction ability. The results of the proposed EMD-LDMR, EEMD-LDMR, EMD-LSLDMR and EEMD-LSLDMR are compared with the conventional support vector regression (SVR), twin SVR (TSVR), LDMR and LSLDMR. The performance of the evaluated using the best-fit model using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), Willmott's index (WI), correlation coefficient (CC) and R2. Better or comparable results specify the efficiency of the suggested models. For graphical visualization, scatterplots, prediction error plots and violin plots are shown. Numerical results show that these hybrid models show excellent prediction performance. The overall analysis of the results suggests using EEMD-LSLDMR for SSL estimation.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide exponentially. Typically, for testing, a provincial main government hospital cum testing center collects patients' specimens from remote health centers in the minimum possible time, satisfying the 'false negativity' constraint of the first collected specimen. With infrastructural developments throughout the world, multiple paths are available for transportation between two cities. Currently, the 'green corridor' is used for the transportation of human organs to be implanted, travel of VIPs, etc., in the minimum possible time. Taking these facts in consideration, for the first time, a green corridor system is suggested to provide a transportation pathway from small hospitals and urban/rural health centers to the testing center with COVID-19 specimens such as blood, nasal and throat swabs, and viral RNA, within the first collected specimen's life period. As health centers are located in different places, appropriate routing plans are needed for visiting them in the minimum possible time. A problem arises if this routing time exceeds the 'false negativity' of the first collected specimen. Thus, multipath COVID-19 specimen collection problems (MPC-19SCPs) are mathematically formulated to be collected from all health centers, and optimum routing plans are obtained using fixed and variable length genetic algorithms (VLGAs) developed for this purpose. For the first time, green corridor systems are suggested to incorporate the centers. The objectives of the models are, subject to the 'false-negative"constraint, minimization of the system time (Model A) and the green corridor time without or with mutual cooperation among the minimum number of centers for the transfer of specimens (Models B and C, respectively). The developed algorithms are based on variable length chromosomes, probabilistic selection, comparison crossover and generation-dependent mutation. Some benchmark instances from TSPLIB are solved by VLGA and GA. The competitiveness of VLGA is established through ANOVA. The models are numerically demonstrated, and some conclusions are derived.

AB A main goal of synthetic biology is the design of logic gates that can reprogram cells to perform various user-defined tasks. One approach is the use of ribozyme-based logic gates (ribogates) consisting of catalytic RNA strands. However, existing ribogate design approaches face limitations in terms of complexity, diversity, ease of use, and reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called Truth-Seq-Er, which generates diverse and complex ribogate designs while improving user-friendliness and accessibility. Truth-Seq-Er uses a quality diversity approach and a novel technique called viability nullification to design 1, 2, and 3-input integrated ribogates that implement both linearly separable and inseparable functions. By requiring only a target Boolean function as input, the algorithm eliminates the need for domain knowledge and streamlines the design process. The diverse designs generated by Truth-Seq-Er are robust against unexpected requirements and provide a large, unbiased dataset for characterizing candidate ribogates. Moreover, we propose a graph-based model for ribogate operation and analyze the design principles shared by different ribogate families. The results demonstrate the potential of Truth-Seq-Er in advancing ribogate design and contributing to the development of novel synthetic biology and unconventional computing applications. Truth-Seq-Er is available for download at https://github.com/nickkamel/Truth_Seq_Er_CLI.

DE Video-text alignment; Cross-modality; Knowledge distillation;
   Transformer; Contrastive learning
AB Most of existing methods solve cross-modal video and text retrieval via coarse-grained similarity computation based on global representations or fine-grained cross-modal interaction. The former misses sufficient information, while the latter suffers from inferior efficiency in inference. Furthermore, hierarchical features of transformer have not been fully utilized in cross-modal contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose similarity-preserving self-distillation method (SPSD) to achieve video and text alignment by cross-granularity and cross-layer ways. For cross-granularity self-distillation, fine-grained cross-modal similarity based on video and text token-wise interaction is transferred to coarse-grained similarity based on global video and text representations. To utilize hierarchical features of deep video and text transformer encoders, we propose cross-layer self-distillation by regarding cross-modal similarity based on semantic features as teacher to provide soft label for the similarity learning based on low-level features. Besides, we construct hierarchical contrastive loss and cross-granularity self-distillation loss at both feature and semantic levels for training transformer-based video and text encoders. SPSD sufficiently utilizes the fine-grained cross-modal interaction and hierarchical transformer features by generating distillation signals through network itself in training stage. In retrieval inference, cross-modal similarity computation between video and text is based on semantic-level global embeddings. Our SPSD achieves outstanding performance for video-text retrieval on MSRVTT, ActivityNet and LSMDC datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Macro-1998/SPSD/.

TI Decision fusion for few-shot image classification

DE Few-shot learning; Decision fusion; Logistic regression; ProCRC
AB Recent few-shot learning methods mostly only use a single classifier to complete image classification. In general, a single classifier is likely to be overfitting because of its inherent drawbacks. However, the recognition rate of categorization will be significantly increased if we can utilize the complementary information of different classifiers. For the few-shot problem, the test samples come from new classes, which makes it difficult for a single classifier to distinguish, and it can be improved via decision fusion. In this paper, we propose decision fusion for few-shot learning (DF-FSL) to overcome the drawbacks of single classifier. To be specific, we assign the task to two classifiers, which are the logical regression classifier and probabilistic collaborative representation-based classifier (ProCRC), then allow the two classifiers to learn together through several iterations. Finally, we evaluate our approach on four benchmark image datasets, which include CIFAR-FS, CUB, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, and two remote sensing image datasets which are RSD46-WHU and NWPU-RESIS45. The experimental results illustrate the complementarity between different classifiers and show that the performance of our proposed DF-FSL method provides an obvious improvement. And DF-FSL can make great progress in few-shot remote sensing image classification.

AB Recently, deep clustering utilizing Graph Neural Networks has shown good performance in the graph clustering. However, the structure information of graph was underused in existing deep clustering methods. Particularly, the lack of concern on mining different types structure information simultaneously. To tackle with the problem, this paper proposes a Graph Clustering Network with Structure Embedding Enhanced (GC-SEE) which extracts nodes importance-based and attributes importance-based structure information via a feature attention fusion graph convolution module and a graph attention encoder module respectively. Additionally, it captures different orders-based structure information through multi-scale feature fusion. Finally, a self -supervised learning module has been designed to integrate different types structure information and guide the updates of the GC-SEE. The comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets commonly used demonstrate the superiority of the GC-SEE. The results showcase the effectiveness of the GC-SEE in exploiting multiple types of structure for deep clustering.

AB Compared to vibration monitoring, acoustic emission (AE) monitoring in gas turbines is highly sensitive to changes that do not involve whole-body motion, such as wear, rubbing, and fluid-induced faults. AE signals captured by suitably mounted sensors can potentially provide early indications of abnormal turbine operation before such abnormalities manifest in structural vibration or emitted airborne noise. However, developing an online fault detection system requires extensive real-time data treatment to extract appropriate features and indicators from raw AE records. To build such a system for industrial turbines, researchers need to understand the AE-generating mechanisms associated with turbine operation and the sources of background noise. In this study, we aim to develop such an understanding using a small-scale turbine whose operational conditions can be modified safely to reflect both normal and faulty conditions. Our signal processing approach involves first extracting a time-series envelope using an averaging time selected to enhance major features and eliminate irrelevant noise. We then generate time-frequency features using a continuous wavelet transform, which are used to train a deep convolutional neural network to classify gas turbine conditions. The resulting model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying two normal running conditions and two faulty conditions at various turbine speeds. Overall, the proposed methodology offers a powerful tool for gas turbine condition monitoring, and we make all associated data available in open-source format to facilitate further research in this field.4

ID SEGMENTATION
AB The pneumoconiosis staging task suffers from the stage ambiguity, especially in the early stage of pneumo-coniosis. The inter-stage reader variability caused by the stage ambiguity and the resulting noisy labels are even more detrimental to the learning of deep neural networks. In this article, we propose a novel deep expert consultation paradigm named ExpertNet to overcome the challenges caused by noisy labels in pneumoconiosis dataset collected from clinical diagnostic reports. The triple-network architecture of ExpertNet simulates an expert consultation group that provides reliable diagnostic suggestions from multiple perspectives. The novel quaternary sample partitioning strategy designed for ExpertNet is inspired by the fact that both certified radiologists and deep networks are troubled by hard samples, where the features are not fully correlated to their labels. The experiments confirm that ExpertNet outperforms the classical methods, which achieves an Accuracy of 89%, a Precision of 81.3%, a Sensitivity of 79.5%, an F1-score of 80.1%, and an AUC of 95.5%. Furthermore, analysis of the confusion matrix on the test set proves that ExpertNet is indeed very similar to an expert consultation group and effectively addresses the key challenge of hard-to-recognize early pneumoconiosis in clinical practice.

AB Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the process of automatic recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from human motion data captured in various data modalities by wearable and ambient sensors. Advances in Deep Learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and sequential models have revolutionalized HAR from video data sources. Although these models are incredibly accurate and utilize both spatial and temporal information, they require huge computation and memory resources - making them unsuitable for edge or wearable applications. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) aims to optimize these models in terms of compute and memory requirements - aiming to make them suitable for always-on resource constrained devices - leading to a reduction in communication latency and network traffic for HAR frameworks. In this paper, we propose a two-stream multi-resolution fusion architecture for HAR from video data modality. The context stream takes a resized image as input and the fovea stream takes the cropped center portion of the resized image as input, reducing the overall dimensionality. We tested two quantization methods: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to optimize these models for deployment in edge devices and tested the performance in two challenging video datasets: KTH and UCF11. We performed ablation studies to validate the two-stream model performance. We deployed the proposed architecture in commercial resource constrained devices and monitored their performance in terms of inference latency and power consumption. The results indicate that the proposed architecture clearly outperforms other relevant single-stream models tested in this work in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score while also reducing the overall model size.

TI TWC-EL: A multivariate prediction model by the fusion of three-way

AB Multivariate data analysis, as an important research topic in the field of machine learning, focuses on how to utilize the intrinsic connection between feature variables and target variables. However, in the face of complex multivariate prediction environments, existing single prediction models often fail to obtain ideal results. Meanwhile, existing ensemble prediction models are not always adapted to certain complex data. Moreover, the randomness in the clustering process cannot guarantee the clustering accuracy. Therefore, to improve the model's prediction accuracy and ability to adapt to complex data and reduce the impact of randomness on clustering accuracy, this paper designs a multivariate prediction model utilizing three-way clustering (TWC) and ensemble learning, which is named the TWC-EL model. First, the initial division of the sample set is realized by k-means clustering algorithm, and further the sample set is divided again via the k-means clustering algorithm to solve the problem of clustering accuracy. Then, the results of clustering twice are combined according to the difference in the number of intersection points and the distance from the samples to the center point of each cluster, and the core and fringe regions of each cluster in the initial clustering results are obtained, forming a new TWC method. Next, based on the correlation between the regions, the obtained core and fringe regions are classified into low-correlation, medium-correlation and high-correlation regions, and an ensemble prediction model is designed by combining the advantages of the Elman neural network model, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) model. Finally, the experimental analysis results exhibit that the constructed TWC-EL model is efficient and feasible, and points out the excellent performance compared with the existing prediction models. The validity of the TWC method and the ensemble prediction model in the proposed TWC-EL model are verified by experiments, respectively.

AB Path planning and obstacle avoidance in 3D terrain have been identified as a monumental challenge for a UAV in a variety of autonomous missions, such as disaster management, and search and rescue operations. In large terrain areas, it is a key problem for traditional approaches to search within the point-cloud maps to find a global path for a UAV considering the flight safety, maneuverability, weather constraints, and fuel cost. Hence, this paper proposes a trajectory planning technique for global and local path planning of a fixed-wing UAV above 3D terrain under static and dynamic constraints. For global path generation, a novel feature selection-based decision model has been proposed to select the features of a point-cloud map and transform them into the feature set. The feature set is utilized by an A* multi-directional planner with an extensive search area to deliver an optimal global path. The global path is assumed as the UAV's reference waypoints. The motion of the UAV on reference waypoints is simplified with two coordinates (R, d), where R is the cumulative distance covered by the UAV along the reference waypoints and d is its offset distance from the reference line segment in time t. For the local path planning, offset trajectories are generated along with reference waypoints to avoid collisions. Cost functions have been added so that the best global and local path can be chosen, taking into account altitude, weather, and fuel constraints. The simulation results and comparison show that the proposed approach outperforms various other 3D UAV path planning techniques in complex terrain.

AB The literature on fraud analytics and fraud detection has seen a substantial increase in output in the past decade. This has led to a wide range of research topics and overall little organization of the many aspects of fraud analytical research. The focus of academics ranges from identifying fraudulent credit card payments to spotting illegitimate insurance claims. In addition, there is a wide range of methods and research objectives. This paper aims to provide an overview of fraud analytics in research and aims to organize the discipline and its many subfields. We analyze a sample of almost 300 records on fraud analytics published between 2011 and 2020. In a systematic way, we identify the most prominent domains of application, challenges faced, performance metrics, and methods used. In addition, we build a framework for fraud analytical methods and propose a keywording strategy for future research. One of the key challenges in fraud analytics is access to public datasets. To further aid the community, we provide eight requirements for suitable data sets in research motivated by our research. We structure our sample of the literature in an online database. The database is available online for fellow researchers to investigate and potentially build upon.

AB Predictive driving functions based on load profile prediction can make an important contribution to the urgently needed further reduction in energy consumption of road vehicles. In this context, this paper presents a method that precisely and efficiently predicts the driving resistances of an upcoming trip by means of online parameter estimation and system identification based on the driving route and weather data. A parameter estimation has been implemented that determines at the beginning of each trip different parameters such as the total vehicle mass, the dynamic rolling radius as well as the absolute and relative inclination of the vehicle relative to the road. It then performs an online calibration of the speed and acceleration calculation. In addition, a method was developed that allows the prediction of driving resistances based on the estimated parameters as well as environmental data such as road roughness and wind conditions. The developed functions were validated against real-world measurements under different environmental conditions and were able to reduce the prediction error in parameter estimation to a median of less than 2 %, while the prediction error of the driving resistances was reduced from sometimes more than 40 % to a few percentage points compared to conventional approaches.

DE Graph Neural Network; Graph Convolution Network; Graph Attention

AB Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a promising technique in representation learning on graph data. Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) are two main representative techniques in GNN, which can learn node embedding on the graph by aggregating the embedding of the neighborhoods. However, the complex computation process of existing GCN and GAT makes them less effective for tasks with complex graph structures. Moreover, traditional GCN and GAT ignore the time factor in user representation learning, so the obtained user preference model is static and cannot reflect the dynamics of user preferences. In this work, we propose a time-aware Lightweight Graph Convolutional Attention Network (LightGCAN), which can capture static and dynamic user preferences efficiently by using different GNN strategies. Specifically, static user preferences are modeled by a GCN with only neighborhood aggregation, and dynamic user preferences are extracted by a time-aware GAT based on recently interacted items. Static and dynamic user preferences are then combined and fed into a dual-channel Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for feature interaction learning and matching score prediction. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that LightGCAN is superior to the SOTA recommendation method.

DE Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning; Self-imitation learning;
   Deterministic policy gradient; Behavior cloning
AB Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) aims to control agents to reach desired goals, which poses a significant challenge due to task-specific variations in configurations. However, current GCRL methods suffer from limitations in sample efficiency and the need for substantial training data. While existing self-imitation based GCRL approaches can improve sample efficiency, their scalability to large-scale tasks is limited. In this paper, we propose integrating self-imitation learning with goal-conditioned RL methods into a compatible and reasonable framework. Specifically, we introduce a novel target action value function to aggregate self imitation learning and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. The designed target value effectively combines these two policy training mechanisms to accomplish specific tasks. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that our approach can learn a superior policy compared to both self-imitation learning and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results showcase the stability and effectiveness of our method compared to existing approaches in various challenging robotic control tasks.

DE Forgery detection; DeepFake; Few-shot; Face manipulation
AB The increase in face manipulation models has led to a critical issue in society-the synthesis of realistic visual media. With the emergence of new forgery approaches at an unprecedented rate, existing forgery detection methods suffer from significant performance drops when applied to unseen novel forgery approaches. In this work, we address the few-shot forgery detection problem by (1) designing a comprehensive benchmark based on coverage analysis among various forgery approaches, and (2) proposing Guided Adversarial Interpolation (GAI). Our key insight is that there exist transferable distribution characteristics between majority and minority forgery classes.1 Specifically, we enhance the discriminative ability against novel forgery approaches via adversarially interpolating the forgery artifacts of the minority samples to the majority samples under the guidance of a teacher network. Unlike the standard re-balancing method which usually results in over-fitting to minority classes, our method simultaneously takes account of the diversity of majority information as well as the significance of minority information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GAI achieves state-of-the-art performances on the established few-shot forgery detection benchmark. Notably, our method is also validated to be robust to choices of majority and minority forgery approaches.

AB A significant part of global quantum computing research has been conducted based on quantum mechanics, which can now be used with quantum computers. However, designing a quantum algorithm requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics and physics procedures. This work presents a generic quantum "black box" for entropy calculation. It does not depend on the data type and can be applied to building and maintaining machine learning models. The method has two main advantages. First, it is accessible to those without preliminary knowledge of quantum computing. Second, it is based on the quantum circuit with a constant depth of three, which is equivalent to three operations the circuit would perform to achieve the same result. We implemented our method using the IBM simulator and tested it over different types of input. The results showed a high correspondence between the classical and quantum computations that raised an error of up to 8.8e-16 for different lengths and types of information.

DE Style transfer; Deep reinforcement learning; TD3; Autoencoders; NPST
AB Neural Style Transfer (NST) was originally proposed to use feature extraction capabilities of Neural Networks as a way to perform Style Transfer with images. Pre-trained image classification architectures were selected for feature extraction, leading to new images showing the same content as the original but with a different style. In robotics, Style Transfer can be employed to transfer human motion styles to robot motions. The challenge lies in the lack of pre-trained classification architectures for robot motions that could be used for feature extraction. Neural Policy Style Transfer TD3 (NPST3) is proposed for the transfer of human motion styles to robot motions. This framework allows the same robot motion to be executed in different human-centered motion styles, such as in an "angry", "happy", "calm", or "sad"fashion. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) network is introduced for the generation of control policies. An autoencoder network is in charge of feature extraction for the Style Transfer step. The Style Transfer step can be performed both offline and online: offline for the autonomous executions of human-style robot motions, and online for adapting at runtime the style of e.g., a teleoperated robot. The framework is tested using two different robotic platforms: a robotic manipulator designed for telemanipulation tasks, and a humanoid robot designed for social interaction. The proposed approach was evaluated for both platforms, performing a total of 147 questionnaires asking human subjects to recognize the human motion style transferred to the robot motion for a predefined set of actions.

AB Researchers have conducted studies using various metaheuristic algorithms for multi-robot path planning recently. One of these algorithms, sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) cannot produce satisfactory results in path planning problems, due to a single update strategy. It is necessary to adopt multiple update strategies and improve its performance for a wider set of problems. We have proposed a new multi-strategy self-adaptive differential sine-cosine algorithm (sdSCA) that uses a pool of strategies and allows for more frequent selection of strategies that lead to better solutions. Thus, dependency of SCA on a single strategy has been removed and it has become a more stable for a wider set of problems and convergence of SCA is improved. Firstly, effectiveness of sdSCA was tested in CEC2015 benchmark functions and CEC2020 real-world optimization problems. Performance of sdSCA at these tests is satisfactory. Secondly, sdSCA was applied to online multi-robot path planning in complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles. In this path planning simulation, the proposed algorithm achieved an average improvement of 42% compared to SCA. It also appears to produce results superior to state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.

AB The problem faced by the food banks operating on the front-end model is the collection of surplus food from donation points and re-distribution of it to the demand points using a fleet of vehicles available at different volunteer locations/depots within specified time windows. Further, due to the limited vehicle capacity, demand splitting is allowed at the pickup as well and delivery points. Therefore, this problem can be seen as a rich variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and named as a multi-depot VRP with time windows, split pickup and split delivery (MDVRP-TW-SP-SD). The problem is to determine the optimal number of vehicles from each depot to be hired and their optimal routes (sequence for visiting pickup and demand nodes) such that the total cost of hiring the vehicles, routing cost and penalty for unmet demand are minimized and it is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formulate the MDVRP-TW-SP-SD. To efficiently and effectively solve the problem, an elitist GA and a GA hybridized with the local search are proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested through extensive computational experiments carried out on 180 modified benchmark problem instances from the literature. The results of computational experiments show the superiority of the GA hybridized with 3-opt local search. A case of the Robin Hood Army operating in the Lucknow city of India is also presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model to practice.

AB This paper aims to predict the economic resilience to crises of territories based on local pre-existing socioeco-nomic characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case of Italian municipalities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging a large-scale dataset of cardholders performing transactions in Point-of-Sales. Based on a set of machine learning classifiers, we show that network-based measures and variables related to the social, economic, demographic and environmental dimensions are relevant predictors of the economic resilience of Italian municipalities to the crisis. In particular, we find accurate classification performance both in balanced and un-balanced scenarios, as well as in the case we restrict the analysis to specific geographical areas. Our analysis predicts that territories with larger income per capita, soil consumption, concentration of real estate activities and commuting network centrality in terms of closeness and Pagerank constitute the set of most affected areas, experiencing the strongest reduction of economic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we provide an application of an early-warning system able to provide timely evidence to policymakers about the detrimental effects generated by natural disasters and severe crisis episodes, thus contributing to optimize public decision support systems.

ID FEATURES; MODEL
AB With the explosion in the volume of collected high-resolution aerial image data, the development of effective image retrieval methods for remote sensing (RS) has become a popular area of research. The problem of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) for high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) requires robust feature extraction and representation to extract high-level semantics followed by a similarity measurement method to compute the similarity between images based on these semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse graph learning-based triplet network for deep metric learning-based HRRS CBIR. First, the graph representations of the aerial images are constructed via local feature descriptors and unsupervised segmentation that provide an efficient graph-structured representation of the images. Then, a novel attention graph convolutional network is developed to extract high-level semantics from the spatial patterns of the images' segmented regions by aggregating region-node features. The attention mechanism and the pyramid pooling structure of the graph network help the proposed model extract powerful spatial features by preserving the structural information of the images while reducing the data's dimensionality. Finally, a novel task-driven dictionary learning (TDDL) method based on triplet loss constructs a sparse metric space for the similarity measurement of the images in which the computed sparse codes for the images promote intra-class similarity between same-class images and inter-class dissimilarity between images of different classes. The proposed sparse features reduce the dimensionality of model parameters which mitigates overfitting and improves the generalization of the overall framework for deep metric learning. Our TDDL method adopts a bi-level optimization strategy so that the dictionary can be trained alongside the parameters of the graph representation network in an end-to-end fashion. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of the performance of our proposed architecture on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art models and obtain superior results.

AB Sustainable Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) poses a complex challenge, as it often requires trade-offs in decision-making. The problem becomes even more challenging when there is a need to integrate risk management into the design process. It is steered by this challenge that the purpose of the paper is twofold. First, it proposes a Simulation-Based Decision Support System (SBDSS) for a real case study of a Portuguese wine SCND problem. Second, it analyzes different wine Supply Chain (SC) configurations under risk situations and sustainability objectives. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, it concerns the method that was employed, which, contrarily to traditional approaches in literature (e.g., stochastic or genetic programming), consists of a simulation approach, in which agents and their interactions in an environment with uncertainty are modeled. Second, for the generation of non-dominated solutions, a simheuristic was employed, which combines multi-objective optimization with simulation. Finally, the type of industry that was considered, due to the lack of cases focusing on it in literature. The results suggest that the proposed approach determines a set of Pareto-front solutions that consider the sustainability dimensions of SCND, as well as risk situations. Furthermore, the implications that several parameters have on the sustainability of the designed SCs were assessed, as well as the impacts that the considered risks have on the performance of SCs. In particular, it was found that transportation risks impacted considerably more the performance of the SC than the risks on the prices of energy and raw materials.

AB Efficient algorithms, intelligent approaches, and intensive use of computers are crucial to extracting reliable information from large-scale data sets. It is the case, for example, in retrieving information from multimedia data. As different systems integrate individual electronic devices such as smartphones and cameras into storage, sharing, and social media platforms, the amount of multimedia data has increased dramatically in recent years. Therefore, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce a new image descriptors integration to represent the visual attributes of images. Furthermore, we noticed a pattern between different CBIR systems in which the first images retrieved are more likely to be assertive than those in the middle and final positions. Then, we investigated the interactions between the first images retrieved from CBIR systems to present a novel method for reducing accuracy noise. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in different data sets (Corel-1K, Corel-5K, Corel-10K, GHIM-10K) and compared to related works. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposal consistently retrieves images with similar content. The code prepared by the authors is publicly available.

AB The measurement of colony growth in a solid medium is commonly applied in phytopathology. The measure-ment procedures usually involve the visual identification and manual measurement of colonies in Petri dishes. Recently, some measurement techniques have been developed based on the segmentation of colony images by using digital image analysis and machine learning models. These approaches have in common: a highly controlled environment where the images were obtained; and a segmented image as output. In addition, few machine learning studies explore the importance of image features in the classification process and test a minimal range of algorithms. Thus, in this study, we propose a classification method of fungal growth based on machine learning, which performs this task using images obtained without any control of the luminosity conditions. An image dataset was created with a set of 537 images of Petri dishes incubated with Botrytis cinerea and obtained in the phytopathology laboratory of the UTFPR. The images were preprocessed, and a set of 97 feature descriptors extracted from them generated five different datasets. Experiments were carried out with 9 different classification algorithms trained through repetitive cross-validation resampling. Induced models were compared in terms of the Balanced Accuracy per Class and F-Score metrics, with statistical significance verified through the Kruskal-Wallis test. From all trained models, 15 showed both balanced accuracy and F-score values above 0.82, and the top 12 showed no difference at 5% of significance by the statistical test. Among the evaluated features, the color channels were the most relevant, especially the standard deviation of the intensity channel.

AB In real-world scenarios, considerable human power and expert knowledge are required to label data. Therefore, solving short text classification problems in a semi-supervised manner is a good method. Existing graph-based semi-supervised short text classification models can achieve good classification performance. However, these models do not introduce some prior knowledge related to short texts, such as commonsense knowledge and concepts, from the knowledge bases to alleviate the data sparsity of short texts, which limits the improvement of classification performance. To overcome the above limitations, this paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised short text classification by proposing a novel model called the Commonsense Knowledge-Powered Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (CSK-HGAT). This model mines the short text-related commonsense knowledge from the definitions corresponding to extracted short text keywords and obtains the short text conceptual information from the existing knowledge bases by conceptualizing the identified short text entities. Next, the embeddings are generated separately for short texts, commonsense knowledge, and concepts. Then, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) containing diverse knowledge is constructed by using the semantic relations among the short texts, commonsense knowledge and the concepts. Finally, this HIN is embedded into the heterogeneous graph attention network model (containing node-level and type-level attentions) to fully utilize the mined prior knowledge (i.e., commonsense knowledge and concepts) to achieve effective semi-supervised short text classification. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed CSK-HGAT model outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised short text classification models in terms of classification accuracy.

AB Recently, research on multimodal learning using all modality information has been conducted to detect disinformation on multimedia. Existing multimodal learning methods include score-level fusion approaches combining different models, and feature-level fusion methods combining embedding vectors to integrate data of different dimensions. Because a late-level fusion method is combined after the modalities are individually operated, there is a limit in that the recognition performance of a unimodal determines the performance. In addition, a fusion method has constraints in that the data among the modalities must be matched. In this study, we propose a classification system using a RoBERTa-based multimodal fusion transformer (RoBERTaMFT) that applies a co-learning method to solve the limitations of the recognition performance of multimodal learning as well as the data imbalance among the modalities. RoBERTaMFT consists of image feature extraction, co learning using the reconstruction of image features with text embedding, and a late-level fusion step applied to the final classification. As experiment results using the CrisisMMD dataset indicate, RoBERTaMFT achieved an accuracy 21.2% and an f1-score 0.414 higher than those of unimodal learning, and an accuracy 11.7% and an f1-score 0.268 higher than those of existing multimodal learning.

AB In this paper, a metaheuristic algorithm called PID-based search algorithm (PSA) is proposed for global optimization. The algorithm is based on an incremental PID algorithm that converges the entire population to an optimal state by continuously adjusting the system deviations. PSA is mathematically modeled and implemented to achieve optimization in a wide range of search spaces. PSA is used to solve CEC2017 benchmark test functions and six constrained problems. The optimization performance of PSA is verified by comparing it with seven metaheuristics proposed in recent years. The Kruskal-Wallis, Holm and Friedman tests verified the superiority of PSA in terms of statistical significance. The results show that PSA can be better balanced exploration and exploitation with strong optimization capability. Source codes of PSA are publicly available at https://ww2.math works.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/131534-pid-based-search-algorithm.

AB Emotion assessment is a challenging task in the human-computer interaction interface. Previous studies have examined the relationship between emotion and color, but they fail to accurately analyze emotional semantics due to the numerous elements in human-computer interaction interfaces. As a result, a combination model of a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) was presented in this paper to predict the emotion semantics of the human-computer interaction interface. The mechanism of generating the weights and thresholds for each layer of BPNN was converted to the search for an optimal honey source. Meanwhile, according to experiment results and evaluation of elements in human-computer interaction interfaces, this paper has assessed the relationships amongst the eight key elements (ratio of graphics to text, color difference, color distribution, color harmony, theme style, white space ratio, frame style, number of colors) and emotion word pairs (moderation-fancy, calm-pleasure, confusing-clear, cold-kind, coarse-elegant). Furthermore, an emotion application database was established to determine how the amalgamation of critical elements affects the users' feelings about the human-computer interaction interface to help designers build a user-centric interface. Finally, the database can be applied to relieve mental health problems by meeting the psychological expectations of users as mental healthcare intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, it can help designers to design a pleasurable visual interaction interface for a particular element to convey healthrelated information and protective measures.

AB Intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) is an efficient tool for describing the paired comparisons between objectives in group decision making (GDM). Existing GDM methods with IMPRs overlook the hesitancy of IMPRs and lack a feedback mechanism of adjustment in the consensus reaching process (CRP). Thus, to ensure that the adjusted IMPRs can provide reliable information for decision making, the hesitancy measure for IMPRs is first incorporated into the process of enhancing consistency and consensus. A new consistency index for IMPRs is defined based on distance measure. Some goal programming models are constructed for enhancing consistency of IMPR. For a collection of IMPRs with unacceptable consistency and consensus, based on the optimization model and the identification rule and direction rule (IR-DR), an interactive iterative algorithm is designed for enhancing consistency and consensus, which can greatly save the completion time of consensus reaching and maintain primitive information to the maximum. Subsequently, a distance-based aggregation model is constructed to derive the group IMPR by considering different experts' decision-making principles. Thereby, a new GDM method with IMPRs considering minimum adjustment is proposed. Moreover, the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through a numerical example and some related simulation experiments. Meanwhile its merits are illustrated by comparison analyses.

AB Pixel value ordering (PVO) is a prominent method for reversible data hiding, which has gained increasing research interest in recent years due to its effective performance producing high-fidelity marked images. PVObased methods performance lies on block dimensions and thresholds for classification. However, most methods determine proper parameters by performing exhaustive searches in restricted search spaces. In this paper, we present a novel Pixel Value Ordering technique based on Genetic Algorithms (PVO-GA) to address these issues. PVO-GA uses flexible sized blocks to take advantage of different block features, to better exploit image redundancy. A genetic algorithm is introduced to optimize the embedding process since the solutions space is greatly expanded. Results showed that PVO-GA achieves satisfactory levels in terms of the introduced distortion while significantly reduces the computational cost needed to find the optimal set of insertion parameters when compared to previous methods.

TI GINT: A Generative Interpretability method via perturbation in the

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Interpretability; Neural networks; Generative model
AB As the neural networks get deeper and deeper, model interpretation becomes more necessary and important, especially in high-risk fields such as medicine and finance. From the perspective of feature attribution, most existing attempts aim to identify relevant features contributing the most to the prediction. Among them, perturbation-based methods mainly explore the corresponding model's output by randomly perturbing the given features. When the data is high-dimensional and sparse, perturbing the feature space may be inefficient and meaningless since it ignores the feature correlations in the data distribution. In this paper, we introduce a novel Generative INTerpretability method, named GINT, which generates perturbations in the latent space. We propose a unified framework for perturbation-based methods, which describes the characteristics of a suitable perturbation for interpretation. Under the framework, we adopt a generative model to generate perturbation instead of randomly perturbing. Subsequently, we sample perturbations from the generative model for a given instance and its prediction and calculate the feature importance by analyzing those perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to evaluate the knowledge state of students based on their coursework interactions in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). It is the most fundamental and challenging task in the system. Existing KT models have achieved promising results. However, considerable interactions between the student entity and the other two types of entities (i.e., questions and skills) in ITS have not been well utilized, which restricts the performance of these models. To this end, we propose HIN-KT, a novel heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based pre-processing model, to further enhance the performance of existing KT models. An HIN is first built to model student-question-skill interactions. Subsequently, HIN-KT employs the interaction information modeled by HIN to pre-train embeddings for questions and then adopts pre-trained question embeddings to enhance the performance of recent deep KT models. Experimental results over three public KT datasets demonstrate that large gains in knowledge tracing can be achieved when the proposed HIN-KT model is used to pre-train question embeddings for state-of-the-art deep KT models. In particular, the two state-of-the-art deep KT models, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) and convolutional knowledge tracing (CKT) successfully improved their performance by an average of 7.88% with the help of the HIN-KT model, which is significant progress made in the knowledge tracing domain.

AB The air pollutant diffusion trend prediction plays an important role in the environment protection. The ap-proaches in the existing studies rarely consider spatial and temporal information sequentially or cannot use spatiotemporal structure information effectively. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based air pollutant diffusion trend prediction model, called GATBL-Learning. It is an end-to-end neural network model consisting of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Encoder-Decoder model. Since each city in the region will set as a node, GAT can extract spatial information from them by aggregation operation. Then Encoder-Decoder model, consisting of Bi-LSTM as Encoder and LSTM as Decoder, mines time series features and outputs the data containing spatiotemporal features. In addition, we also observe that the changes of air pollutants show seasonality discipline and training the seasonal model can improve the model adaptability. The results demonstrate the proposed prediction model is effective and superior.

DE Multipage document Visual Question; Answering; Document Visual Question

AB Existing work on DocVQA only considers single-page documents. However, in real applications documents are mostly composed of multiple pages that should be processed altogether. In this work, we propose a new multimodal hierarchical method Hi-VT5, that overcomes the limitations of current methods to process long multipage documents. In contrast to previous hierarchical methods that focus on different semantic granularity (He et al., 2021) or different subtasks (Zhou et al., 2022) used in image classification. Our method is a hierarchical transformer architecture where the encoder learns to summarize the most relevant information of every page and then, the decoder uses this summarized representation to generate the final answer, following a bottom-up approach. Moreover, due to the lack of multipage DocVQA datasets, we also introduce MP-DocVQA, an extension of SP-DocVQA where questions are posed over multipage documents instead of single pages. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Hi-VT5 is able, in a single stage, to answer the questions and provide the page that contains the answer, which can be used as a kind of explainability measure.

AB The ability to follow the gaze of others deteriorates with age. This decline is typically tested with gaze cueing tasks, in which the time it takes to respond to targets on a screen is faster when they are preceded by a facial cue looking in the direction of the target (i.e., gaze cueing effect). It is unclear whether age-related differences in this effect occur with gaze cues other than the eyes, such as head orientation, and how these vary in function of the cue-target timing. Based on the perceived usefulness of social robots to assist older adults, we asked older and young adults to perform a gaze cueing task with the head of a NAO robot as the central cue. Crucially, the head was viewed from the back, and so its eye gaze was conveyed. In a control condition, the head was static and faced away from the participant. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between cue and target was 340 ms or 1000 ms. Both age groups showed a gaze cueing effect at both SOAs. Older participants showed a reduced facilitation effect (i.e., faster on congruent gazing trials than on neutral trials) at the 340-ms SOA compared to the 1000-ms SOA, and no differences between incongruent trials and neutral trials at the 340-ms SOA. Our results show that a robot with non-visible eyes can elicit gaze cueing effects. Age-related differences in the other effects are discussed regarding differences in processing time.

AB This paper proposes a neural network-based (NN-based) data-driven iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm for the tracking problem of nonlinear single-input single-output (SISO) discrete-time systems with unknown models and repetitive tasks. The control objective is to make the output of the system track the reference trajectory in each iteration process. Therefore, at each relative time during every iteration process, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is used as the estimator to solve the key parameters of the system, and a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used as the controller to solve the control input. Compared with the traditional ILC algorithm, the two complex solving processes, i.e., dynamic linearization and criterion function minimization, are replaced and simplified into the iterative training of GRNNs and RBFNNs. The proposed algorithm is out-of-the-box and uses a point-to-point method to calculate the control input for each relative time of the system iteration, driving the tracking error of the system to approach zero. In addition, it is proved that the tracking error of the system under the proposed control algorithm is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical example shows the effectiveness and superiority of the control algorithm, and a path tracking experiment of an unmanned vehicle further verifies its practicability.

AB The generalized mathematical model for HSI denoising or destriping lacks stability and uniqueness properties, failing to accurately portray the distribution and effects of stripes. Solutions following such a model would inevitably result in excessive destriping of strip-free areas, leading to the loss of texture detail. To remedy the above deficiencies, we reformulate the destriping task and introduce a novel solution from the task decomposition view. It is broken down into auxiliary sub-tasks involving stripe mask detection, stripe intensity estimation, and HSI restoration, which greatly reduces the difficulty of solving such an ill-posed problem. Based on this, we adopt a sequential multi-task learning framework and propose a stripes location-dependent restoration network, termed SLDR, which integrates the distribution and intensity features of stripes to achieve accurate destriping and high-fidelity restoration. Furthermore, we design a stripe attribute-aware estimator and a weighted total variation loss function to capture the unique properties of stripes and adaptively adjust the restoration weights of striped and non-striped regions. Extensive evaluation and comprehensive ablation studies on synthetic and practical scenes show the effectiveness and superiority of our model and architecture.

AB Recently, the evidential clustering has been developed as a promising clustering framework for uncertain data, which generalizes those hard, fuzzy, possibilistic and rough clustering. However, the resulting cluster assignments are less interpretable in terms of human cognition, which limits its applications in those security, privacy or ethic related fields. In this study, the unsupervised decision tree model is introduced into the evidential clustering framework to improve the interpretability of the evidential partition. A Decision Tree based Evidential Clustering (DTEC) algorithm is developed to build an unsupervised evidential decision tree, which uses the paths from the root node to leaf nodes to achieve the interpretability of each cluster. The proposed algorithm is composed of three procedures, i.e., cutting-point selection, node evidential splitting, and cluster adjustment, in which the first two procedures are carried out iteratively to build a preliminary unsupervised decision tree and the last procedure is designed to adjust the preliminary decision tree if the number of clusters is available. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposal compared with some representative fuzzy, evidential or decision tree-based clustering algorithms.

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB Adversarial attacks have attracted much attention in recent years, and a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of attacks on the entire image at perturbation generation. However, in practice, specially designed perturbation of the entire image is impractical. Some work has crafted adversarial samples with a few scrambled pixels by advanced search, e.g., SparseFool, OnePixel, etc., but they take more time to find such pixels that can be perturbed. Therefore, to construct the adversarial samples with few pixels perturbed in an end-to-end way, we propose a new framework, in which a dual-decoder VAE for perturbations finding is designed. To make adversarial learning more effective, we proposed a new version of the adversarial loss by considering the generalization. To evaluate the sophistication of the proposed framework, we compared it with more than a dozen existing related attack methods. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework are verified from the extensive experimental results. The validity of the model structure is also validated by the ablation study.

   neural network; Generative adversarial network
AB Unpaired image super-resolution (SR) has recently attracted considerable attention in the unsupervised SR community. In contrast to supervised SR, existing unpaired SR methods inevitably resort to the generative adversarial network (GAN) to explore data distribution on the given HR and unpaired LR dataset. Nevertheless, predominant strategies often strive for sophisticated network structures or training pipelines, making them intractable to apply in real-world scenarios. In this work, a lightweight invertible neural network (INN) is proposed for unpaired SR to alleviate this limitation. Specifically, we regard image degradation and SR as a pair of mutually-inverse tasks and replace the two generators in one-stage GAN with INN. Due to the information lossless nature of INN, it is impossible to generate noise in vain during image degradation. We thus design a simple noise injection network to induce realistic noise, thereby simulating real LR images. To further maintain the stability and realism of the noise, we propose to extract the noise prior from the real-world LR image. With extracted noise prior as input, our noise injection network can narrow the gap between the generated noise and the real one, thereby encouraging the degraded images to match the real-world LR domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance with other SOTA methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations while enjoying faster speed and much smaller parameters.

AB Scene understanding in a production workshop is an important technology to improve its intelligence level, semantic segmentation of production workshop objects is an effective method for realizing scene understanding. Since the varieties of information of production workshop, making full use of the complementary information of RGB image and depth image can effectively improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of production workshop objects. Aiming at solving the multi-scale and real-time problems of segmenting the production workshop objects, this paper proposes Cross-Modal Transformer (CMFormer), a Transformer-based cross-modal semantic segmentation model. Its key feature correction and feature fusion parts are composed of the Multi-Scale Channel Attention Correction(MS-CAC) module and the Global Feature Aggregation(GFA) module. By improving Multi Head Self-Attention(MHSA) in Transformer, we design Cross-Modal Multi-Head Self-Attention(CM-MHSA) to build long-range interaction between RGB image and depth image, and further design the MS-CAC module and the GFA module on the basis of the CM-MHSA module, to achieve cross-modal information interaction in the channel and spatial dimensions. Among them, the MS-CAC module enriches the multi-scale features of each channel and achieve more accurate channel attention correction between the two modals; the GFA module interacts with RGB feature and depth feature in the spatial dimension and fuses global and local features at the same time. In the experiments on the NYU Depth v2 dataset, the CMFormer reached 68.00% MPA(Mean Pixel Accuracy) and 55.75% mIoU(Mean Intersection over Union), achieves the state-of-the-art results. While in the experiments on the Scene Objects for Production workshop dataset(SOP), the CMFormer achieves 96.74% MPA, 92.98% mIoU and 43 FPS(Frames Per Second), which has high precision and good real-time performance.

DE Weakly-supervised learning; Crowd counting; Multi-granularity MLP;
   Self-supervised proxy task
AB Currently, state-of-the-art crowd counting algorithms rely excessively on location-level annotations, which are burdensome to acquire. When only weak supervisory signals at the count level are available, it is arduous and error-prone to regress total counts due to the lack of explicit spatial constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel and efficient counter, CrowdMLP, which explores the modelling of global dependencies of embeddings and regresses total counts by designing a multi-granularity MLP regressor. Specifically, a locally-focused pre-trained frontend is used to extract crude feature maps with intrinsic spatial cues, preventing the model from collapsing into trivial outcomes. The crude embeddings, along with the raw crowd scenes, are tokenized at different granularity levels. Next, the multi-granularity MLP mixes tokens at the dimensions of cardinality, channel, and spatial for mining global information. We also propose an effective proxy task called Split-Counting to overcome the limited samples and the lack of spatial hints in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMLP significantly outperforms existing weakly-supervised counting algorithms and performs better than state-of-the-art location-level supervised approaches.

AB Landsat image segmentation is important for obtaining large-scale land cover maps. The accuracy of CNN-based Landsat image segmentation highly depends on the quantity and quality of the training samples. However, enough accurate labels for Landsat images are difficult to access. Fortunately, traditional classifier induced segmentation results can be considered as an alternative, although they are noisy and unbalanced to a certain extent. To resist noisy labels and alleviate the impact of imbalanced samples, this paper proposes a confidence interval based balanced random learning strategy. Firstly, a confidence interval-based mask is employed to control the random learning rate of the network from the entire noisy training set. Then, the multi-layer feature maps of CNN are fully utilized to compensate for the information loss in random learning, in which down sampled labels are used to decrease the uncertainty brought by up-sampling CNN feature maps. In addition, considering the corruption of noisy labels on different classes, a balanced random learning with different confidence levels is performed on each class to further improve the learning ability of CNN. Experimental results on two widely used backbones, namely VGGNet and ResNet, demonstrate that the proposed balanced random learning strategy can effectively improve the performance of CNN under imbalanced and noisy labels, which can be improved by 3.41%.

AB Automatically localizing bugs is implemented to maximize the speed of the bug localizing process and minimize the developer's burdens. However, the existing automatic bug localization approaches have not fully used the inter-relations and the intra-relations of the source files and bug reports. In this paper, we present a CDNN-based software localization model, an automatic bug localization model enabled by a Meta-heuristic-based Convolutional Neural Network, and an improved Deep Neural Network, to enhance the effectiveness of the bug localization. First, the bug features are extracted by using word embedding technologies. The hybrid Meta heuristicbased Convolutional Neural Network (HM-CNN) is developed for feature optimization, as it can guarantee reliable localization by selecting the most significant features. The hybrid Meta heuristic-based Deep Neural Network (HM-DNN) is implemented for bug localization by considering objective functions related to the error difference between the actual score and the predicted score. Here, a new combined Grey Wolf-Sun Flower Optimization (HGW-SFO) is adopted for improving the efficiency of the system. Both the CNN in feature extraction (weighted CNN optimization) and DNN in localization phases (hidden neuron optimization) are improved by Hybrid HGW-SFO. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CDNN-based software bug localization model is significantly superior to the other conventional methods over several benchmark datasets in locating the bug source files. From the result analysis, while considering the accuracy value of the proposed HGW-SFO-CDNN, the proposed HGW-SFO-CDNN method secures 5.8%, 5.8%, and 9.75% more advanced performance than CNN, DNN, and CDNN at the number of retrieved files as 20.

AB Commercially available hydraulic pumps exhibit lower performance at a wide range of operating conditions, resulting in a significant decrease in productivity and efficiencies as low as 30%. A new class of digital pump technology has been developed to overcome these limitations. This work builds upon a previously developed high-efficiency digital pump that utilizes high-speed on/off valves. There are four distinct strategies in which the digital pump technology can operate, and each of these strategies offers unique advantages that make it suitable for specific operating conditions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes expert systems technology in combination with several automated machine-learning methodologies to determine the most efficient operating strategy. Different supervised machine-learning algorithms are investigated to predict the overall efficiency of each operating strategy. The best machine-learning model is then employed for selecting the most efficient operating strategy given any operating condition. Given the findings, the efficiencies predicted by the machine-learning model align well with the efficiencies measured through experiments. This innovative approach has resulted in substantial energy savings compared to the currently available pumps in the market.

AB Accurate measurements of ophthalmic parameters and postoperative appearance prediction are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of many ophthalmic diseases. Nevertheless, it remains challenging due to (1) inconsistent ophthalmic image sampling standards, including ocular-camera distance, facial angle, and patient number, (2) complicated ocular morphology, such as subconjunctival hemorrhage, ocular movements, lighting effects, and morphological aging. It is difficult for a model to measure parameters and make predictions in variable sampling methods and morphology conditions. Therefore, the Global attention-based Ophthalmic Image Measurement and Postoperative Appearance Prediction System (GOMPS) is proposed, which quantifies ophthalmic image parameters to diagnose disease and simultaneously predict postoperative appearance of blepharoptosis. By perceiving the global structure of the ophthalmic image, GOMPS makes logical inference predictions of the sclera and cornea morphology, to overcome the above difficulties. Concretely, a global attention unit (GAU) and a novel global attention structure-aware network (GASA-Net) are designed to enhance GOMPS's global structure awareness ability to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental results on our collected ophthalmic dataset for diagnosis & prediction (OD2P) demonstrate that GOMPS surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy and achieves the current optimal performance in measurement and postoperative prediction under many clinical scenes.

AB Medical image segmentation is essential in medical image analysis since it can provide reliable assistance in computer-aided clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and intervention. Although deep learning algorithms based on CNNs and Transformers have made notable progress in medical image segmentation, it is still chal-lenging owing to the objects with complex structures, low discrimination and differences between individuals. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel 3D medical image segmentation network based on Transformers and CNNs combining morphological information and reticular mechanism. Firstly, the morphological constraint stream is designed to learn the prior shape information based on the CNN model and make the attention maps focus on target tasks for enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, the Reticular Transformer is utilized to obtain multi-scale information based on the Transformer, which can bind the local texture information and underlying semantic information to further acquire the feature maps with sufficient details and receptive field. The ex-periments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many existing segmentation models in terms of the performance in metrics DSC and HD (80.46% in DSC on the Synapse dataset and 90.83% in DSC on the ACDC dataset). The code will be released at https://github.com/rocklijun/MCRformer.

AB Current research on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in safety-critical areas remains extremely challenging due to their inability to be fully verified at design time. In this paper, we propose an RTA-IR architecture, which bypasses the formal verification of the AI algorithm by incorporating runtime assurance (RTA) and provides safety assurances for the AI controllers of complex autonomous vehicles (such as those obtained using neural networks) without excessive performance sacrifice. RTA-IR consists of a high-performance and unproven advanced controller and two verifiable safety controllers and a decision module designed based on the Responsibility Sensitive Safety Model (RSS). The advanced controller is designed based on attention generating adversarial imitation learning(GAIL), which can imitate the efficient policies of experts from a set of expert demonstrations. RSS provides verifiable safety criteria and switching logic for the decision module, and RTA-IR provides safety for autonomous vehicles when the advanced controller produces unsafe control, as well as restoring control of the vehicle by the advanced controller under conditions that confirm safety. We tested and evaluated RTA-IR separately for two levels of traffic density in one driving task. Experiments have shown that RTA-IR exhibits superior performance in terms of both safety and efficiency compared to the baseline method.

AB Sentiment analysis, which can discriminate the sentiment tendency of subjective texts, is one of the important research works in the field of natural language processing. Sentiment analysis can be divided into explicit sentiment analysis and implicit sentiment analysis according to whether the text contains explicit sentiment words. Most of the current research work focuses on explicit sentiment analysis, while implicit sentiment analysis has become one of the most challenging research tasks because the sentiment characteristics are too implicit. In this paper, "Fused with Sememe Knowledge Quantum-like Chinese Implicit Sentiment Analysis (FSKQ)"is proposed, which introduces the density matrix in quantum theory and takes sememe, the smallest common sense semantic unit in natural language, as an external knowledge base to build a sememe-based density matrix. The matrix can be regarded as a complete knowledge system with strong generalization, which models the global information of the most fine-grained semantic knowledge. Its incorporation into the text vector results in a high quality of text representation, which effectively improves the performance of the model in Chinese implicit sentiment analysis. Ablation experiments and comparison experiments are conducted in the SMP ECISA2019 dataset, and the results show that the F1 score of the model is improved by 2.6% compared with the best model, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of the idea. In addition, in order to verify the performance of the proposed method in terms of text representation quality, it is also applied to existing models in the aspect-level sentiment analysis and event detection, and it is compared with the original model without using the idea and the baseline model on Twitter, Lap14, Rest14/15/16 and ACE2005 datasets. The results show that compared with the original model and the baseline model in this field, the model combined with the idea improves the accuracy and F1 score, which further proves the effectiveness, superiority and generalization of the FSKQ model.

AB Attribute reduction in partially labeled data, also called semi-supervised attribute reduction, is an important issue. In recent years, the research on semi-supervised attribute reduction has attracted the attention of many scholars. Unfortunately, most existing semi-supervised attribute reduction methods do not handle the information loss caused by missing labels well. Meanwhile, these methods in general only consider the relevance between attributes and labels to measure attribute correlations, which ignores the irrelevant information contained in the attributes with respect to the labels. In view of this, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithm considering attribute relevance, redundancy and label irrelevance from the perspective of label distribution. Firstly, the membership degree of unlabeled objects relative to labels is defined by fuzzy similarity relation, which implements information restoration and converts partially labeled data into label distribution data. Secondly, some fuzzy uncertainty measures for label distribution are defined and related properties are investigated accordingly. Additionally, considering that irrelevant information brought by attributes may lead to over-fitting, label irrelevance criterion based on fuzzy uncertainty measures is constructed. Thirdly, a novel semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithm via the maximum relevance, minimum redundancy, and minimum irrelevance is proposed. Finally, compared with the representative semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithms and supervised attribute reduction algorithm, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by various experiments.

AB Layout generation, as a crucial stage in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) task information presentation generation, is a fascinating and significant research topic. Automatically generating layouts intrigued the computer vision community dating back to the 1990s, and the advancement was sluggish for a time due to the inherent complexity of the issue. Thanks to the success of deep learning, layout generation is leading to a surge in both academic literature and business applications recently. Yet a systematic and comprehensive literature review of this domain is still missing. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art layout generation methods. Primarily, we discuss the problem of layout generation and associated background knowledge including layout representation, layout aesthetics, and generative models. Subsequently, recent advances in the field of intelligent layout generation are organized and summarized from three perspectives: innovations, models & algorithms, and applications. Furthermore, the paper outlines the datasets and evaluation methodology, both qualitative and quantitative, and briefly analyzes the selection of them for specific tasks. To sum up, we conclude the current challenges of intelligent layout generation and suggest possible directions for future endeavors.

AB This paper proposes a robust ordinal regression feedback consensus model based on trust relationships for social network group decision-making problems in intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The model consists of two main parts: (a) the construction of the complete trust matrix among decision makers (DMs) and (b) the design of a feedback mechanism formulated on robust ordinal regression. In Part (a), to complete the initial trust matrix between DMs, a dynamic trust propagation mode founded on maximum credibility is proposed to investigate indirect trust relationships between unfamiliar DMs from the perspective of overall optimization. In Part (b), when the group consensus does not reach the consensus threshold, the utility function compatible with the preference information of DMs is constructed through robust ordinal regression, and the most representative utility function is selected by maximizing the difference of the necessary weak preference relationship. In addition, the performance of DMs under four evaluation dimensions, individual consensus degree, individual comprehensive influence, individual opinion retention, and individual proximity centrality, is aggregated into a total utility value. In each iteration, the DM with the lowest total utility value is identified for opinion adjustments. Further, based on trust-similarity analysis, recommendations are designed for opinion adjustments to improve the group consensus. An illustrative example along with the related sensitivity analysis and comparative study is used to examine the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model.

AB With the increasing number of intelligent human-computer systems, more and more research is focusing on human emotion recognition. Facial expressions are an effective modality in emotional recognition, enhancing automatic emotional analysis. Although significant studies have investigated automatic facial expression recognition in the past decades, previous works were mainly produced for controlled environments. Unlike recent pure CNN-based works, we argue that it is practical and feasible to recognize an expression from a facial image. However, the extracted features may capture more identity-related information and are not purely associated with the specific task of expression recognition. To reduce the personal influence of identity-related features by removing identity information from facial images, we propose a neural style transfer generative adversarial network (NST-GAN) in this paper. The objective is to determine the expression information from the input image by removing identity information and transferring it to a synthetic identity. We employ experimental strategies to evaluate the proposed method on three public facial expression databases (CK+, FER-2013, and JAFFE). Extensive experiments prove that our NST-GAN outperforms other methods, setting a new state of the art.

AB The escalating prevalence of disinformation, or "fake news," on social media platforms represents a growing societal concern with far-reaching implications. Its ubiquitous presence across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram exacerbates the criticality of this issue. Consequently, the development of efficacious counter strategies-such as fact-checking mechanisms and media literacy initiatives-is paramount. This domain of crafting robust defensive strategies against disinformation has burgeoned into an expansive field of investigation, with primary emphasis on the identification and categorization of fake news within the digital media landscape. This study offers a comprehensive survey of the contemporary research landscape on disinformation, or "fake news," detection, and mitigation strategies. We meticulously analyze the life cycle of disinformation-from inception and propagation to detection-shedding light on both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). The paper provides a comparative analysis of different classification models across a variety of text- and image-based datasets related to fake news. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth discussion of the key evaluation metrics used in assessing the accuracy of news authenticity. Challenges have been put forth concerning the sophisticated task of precisely detecting fake news, an undertaking obscured by its subtle and often deceptive aspects. By offering in-depth insights into the phenomenon of fake news and potential counterstrategies, this survey is anticipated to enrich scholarly understanding, thereby catalyzing the development of innovative solutions to tackle this persistent global issue.

ID NETWORK
AB Few-shot image classification aims at learning to generalize to unseen new categories from a few training samples. Transfer learning is one prominent approach to the task, which first learns a backbone from the base classes and then trains a classifier on new classes with the prior learned knowledge. Typically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is the preferred backbone. However, when the samples are limited, the representation ability of the feature extracted by CNN will decrease, thus leading to the performance degradation of few-shot image classification. Recently, the pre-trained large-scale vision-language model like CLIP has shown non-trivial potential, which can be used as a backbone for zero or few-shot transfer on a series of downstream tasks with the prompt. To fully explore the few-shot image classification performance of vision-language models, we propose CoCoOpter, a novel "pre-training + prompt tuning + fine-tuning" paradigm based on CLIP. CoCoOpter alleviates the overfitting and ensures generalizability in unseen new categories. Specifically, it learns an input-specific neural network to relieve overfitting by drawing attention away from a specific category to each specific input sample. Then, to establish connection between the visual and textual signals, it introduces the previously learned visual representations to perform automatic prompt tuning in the middle of the pre-trained CLIP, enabling learning input-specified prompt vectors. Moreover, two learnable lightweight neural networks are added at the end of CLIP to guide information propagation between different classes by fine-tuning both the visual and textual features. We perform extensive experiments on 11 image classification datasets. The results show that CoCoOpter is more generalizable in unseen classes and achieves superior few-shot classification performance with a straightforward design.

AB Multi-view bipartite graph clustering methods select a few representative anchors and then establish a connection with original samples to generate the bipartite graphs for clustering, which maintains impressive performance while reducing time and space complexities. Despite their effectiveness in large-scale applications, few of them focus on cross-view anchor misalignment (CAM) problem. Then, misaligned anchor sets could destroy the consistent graph semantic structure of bipartite graphs across different views, thus hindering sub-sequent graph fusion and degrading the clustering performance. Especially when it comes to incomplete data, solving CAM problem becomes an intractable challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross -view Graph Matching guided Anchor Alignment (CGMAA) for incomplete multi-view bipartite clustering. Specifically, we first propose a novel CGMAA framework to address CAM problem by predefining an anchor graph according to the prior anchor information. In addition, we unify CGMAA and bipartite graph tensor learning for incomplete multi-view clustering. Extensive experiments on ten complete/incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and superiority of the proposed CGMAA framework.

AB Research around Spiking Neural Networks has ignited during the last years due to their advantages when compared to traditional neural networks, including their efficient processing and inherent ability to model complex temporal dynamics. Despite these differences, Spiking Neural Networks face similar issues than other neural computation counterparts when deployed in real-world settings. This work addresses one of the practical circumstances that can hinder the trustworthiness of this family of models: the possibility of querying a trained model with samples far from the distribution of its training data (also referred to as Out-of-Distribution or OoD data). Specifically, this work presents a novel OoD detector that can identify whether test examples input to a Spiking Neural Network belong to the distribution of the data over which it was trained. For this purpose, we characterize the internal activations of the hidden layers of the network in the form of spike count patterns, which lay a basis for determining when the activations induced by a test instance is atypical. Furthermore, a local explanation method is devised to produce attribution maps revealing which parts of the input instance push most towards the detection of an example as an OoD sample. Experimental results are performed over several classic and event-based image classification datasets to compare the performance of the proposed detector to that of other OoD detection schemes from the literature. Our experiments also assess whether the fusion of our proposed approach with other baseline OoD detection schemes can complement and boost the overall OoD detection capability As the obtained results clearly show, the proposed detector performs competitively against such alternative schemes, and when fused together, can significantly improve the detection scores of their constituent individual detectors. Furthermore, the explainability technique associated to our proposal is proven to produce relevance attribution maps that conform to expectations for synthetically created OoD instances.

AB This paper presents a fusion of feature maps extracted from visible and thermal infrared surveillance videos to recognize abnormal human behaviors in low illumination conditions. Abnormal human behaviors often occur at night or in darkness, where a visible camera alone may not capture sufficient visual information for analysis. The proposed scheme uses additional data captured by a thermal infrared camera to enhance information on human appearance and motion. Thermal and visible data are assumed to be informative for analyzing human behaviors, yet they contribute differently to certain areas of video frames. This paper proposes a multimodal feature fusion (MFF) to produce a weight matrix that determines how much thermal or visible input should contribute to obtain optimal performance. Experiment results demonstrate that MFF effectively recognizes abnormal human behaviors in darkness. MFF achieves an overall accuracy of 91.01%, which is at least 4.53% higher than individual thermal or visible data and 2.17% higher than the state-of-the-art fusion-based abnormal human behavior recognition techniques.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Fake news possesses a destructive and negative impact on our lives. With the rapid growth of multimodal content in social media communities, multimodal fake news detection has received increasing attention. Most existing approaches focus on learning the respective deep semantics of various modalities and integrating them by traditional fusion modes (like concatenation or addition, etc.) for improving detection performance, which has achieved a certain degree of success. However, they have two crucial issues: (1) Shallow cross -modal feature fusion, and (2) Difficulty in capturing inconsistent information. To this end, we propose Multimodal Fusion and Inconsistency Reasoning (MFIR) model to discover multimodal inconsistent semantics for explainable fake news detection. Specifically, MFIR consists of three modules: (1) Different from the traditional fusion modes, cross-modal infiltration fusion is designed, which is absorbed in continuously infiltrating and correlating another modality features into its internal semantics based on the current modality, which can well ensure the retention of the contextual semantics of the original modality; (2) Multimodal inconsistent learning not only captures the local inconsistent semantics from the perspectives of text and vision, but also integrates the two types of local semantics to discover global inconsistent semantics in multimodal content; (3) To enhance the interpretability of inconsistent semantics as evidence for users, we develop explanation reasoning layer to supplement the contextual information of inconsistent semantics, resulting in more understandable evidence semantics. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model on three datasets and improved performance by up to 2.8%.

AB As a result of the expeditious advancement of biomedical technologies, a plethora of relational data linking biomedical entities such as genes, proteins, and drugs have been collected for modern biomedical research. Biomedical graphs, one of the most popular ways to represent relational data, can easily describe different complex biomedical systems, including molecular-level, multi-omics-level, therapeutics-level, and healthcare-level interactions. However, traditional graph analysis methods still suffer from two difficulties (i.e., heterogeneities and dynamic properties of biomedical graphs) when handling high-dimensional, multi modal, and sparsely interconnected biomedical data. To address these issues, graph embedding methods that can effectively analyze biomedical graphs have received a significant amount of attention recently. Generally, graph-based data is converted into a low-dimensional vector space with its structural properties and well reserved information. These vectorized representations are used for further computation in various downstream biomedical tasks, such as gene function prediction and drug-target interaction prediction. In this article, we focus on the application of graph data in the biomedical domain and mainly introduce recent developments of graph embedding techniques (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and dynamic graph embedding techniques), including methodologies and related biomedical tasks. We also summarize relevant biomedical datasets and open-source implementations. We further discuss existing limitations and potential solutions. We hope this survey can provide useful directions for researchers who are interested in using graph embedding methods to solve problems in the biomedical field.

AB In the field of traffic forecasting, methods based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) are emerging. But existing methods still have limitations due to insufficient sharing patterns, inflexible temporal relations and static relation assumptions. To address these issues, a Generic Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GDGCN) for traffic flow forecasting is proposed. A generic framework with both parameter-sharing and independent blocks across stacked layers is proposed to explore parameter sharing systematically in all data dimensions, which can exploit distinct patterns from layer to layer and stable patterns across layers simultaneously. Then, we design a novel temporal graph convolutional block to view historical time slots as nodes in graph perspective and handle temporal dynamics with graph convolution. This temporal convolutional block can capture flexible and global temporal relations to have a better understanding of current traffic conditions. Lastly, a dynamic graph constructor is proposed to model not only the time-specific spatial dependencies between nodes, but also the changing temporal interactions between time slots to discover dynamic relations from data thoroughly. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that GDGCN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods, but also obtains interpretable dynamic spatial relations of segments. Codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GDGCN.

TI A multi-grained unsupervised domain adaptation approach for semantic

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; Unsupervised semantic segmentation; Neural network
AB When transferring knowledge between different datasets, domain mismatch greatly hinders model's perfor-mance. So domain adaption has been brought up to tackle the problem. Traditional methods focusing either on global or local alignment play a limited role in improving model's performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-grained unsupervised domain adaptation approach (Muda) for semantic segmentation. Muda aims to enforce multi-grained semantic consistency between domains by aligning domains at both global and category level. Specifically, coarse-grained adaptation uses global adversarial learning on an image translation model and a main segmentation model, which respectively attempts to eliminate appearance differences and to get similar segmentation maps from two domains. While fine-grained adaptation employs an auxiliary model to adapt category information to refine pseudo labels of target data. Experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two synthetic-to-real benchmarks: GTA5-* Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-* Cityscapes, which show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Image is known as one of the communication tools between humans. With the development and availability of digital devices such as cameras and cell phones, taking images has become easy anywhere. Images are used in many medical, forensic medicine, and judiciary applications. Sometimes images are used as evidence, so the authenticity and reliability of digital images are increasingly important. Some people manipulate images by adding or deleting parts of an image, which makes the image invalid. Therefore, image forgery detection and localization are important. The development of image editing tools has made this issue an important problem in the field of computer vision. In recent years, many different algorithms have been proposed to detect forgery in the image and pixel levels. All these algorithms are categorized into two main methods: traditional and deeplearning methods. The deep learning method is one of the important branches of artificial intelligence science. This method has become one of the most popular methods in most computer vision problems due to the automatic identification and prediction process and robustness against geometric transformations and postprocessing operations. In this study, a comprehensive review of image forgery types, benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics in forgery detection, traditional forgery detection methods, discovering the weaknesses and limitations of traditional methods, forgery detection with deep learning methods, and the performance of this method is presented. According to the expansion of deep-learning methods and their successful performance in most computer vision problems, our main focus in this study is forgery detection based on deep-learning methods. This survey can be helpful for a researcher to obtain a deep background in the forgery detection field.

AB Strong efforts have been undertaken to enhance the diagnosis and identification of diseases that cause facial paralysis, such as Bell's palsy and stroke, because of their detrimental social effects. Stroke is one of the most serious and potentially fatal conditions among the major cardiovascular disorders. We are introducing a deeplearning-based method for early diagnosis of facial paralysis diseases such as stroke and Bell's palsy. Recognizing the costs associated with traditional diagnostic techniques like magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan images, our model employs a multi-task network, integrating face parsing, facial asymmetry parsing, and category enhancement. Spatial inconsistencies are addressed via a depth-map estimation module that leverages an instance-specific kernel approach. To clarify the boundaries of facial components, we use category edge detection with a foreground attention module, generating generic geometric structures and detailed semantic cues. Our model is trained on two datasets, comprising individuals with regular smiles and those with one-sided facial weakness. This cost-effective, easily accessible solution can streamline the diagnostic process, minimizing data gaps, and reducing needless rescreening and intervention costs.

AB Graph-based methods have achieved great success in multi-view clustering. However, existing graph-based models generally utilize shallow and linear embedding functions to obtain the common spectral embedding for clustering assignments. In addition, the fusion similarity graphs from multiple views are generally obtained by a simple weighted-sum rule. To this end, we propose a novel deep multi-view spectral clustering via ensemble model (DMCE), which applies ensemble clustering to fuse the similarity graphs from different views. On this basis, we employ the graph auto-encoder to learn the common spectral embedding, which can be regarded as the indicator matrix directly. Moreover, a unified optimization framework is designed to update the variables in the proposed DMCE, which consists of graph reconstruction loss, orthogonal loss, and graph contrastive learning loss. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model compared with the state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.

DE Point clouds; Adversarial attack; Salient regions; Adversarial examples
AB Modern artificial intelligence systems rely heavily on deep learning techniques. However, deep neural networks are easily disturbed by adversarial objects. Adversarial examples are beneficial to improve the robustness of the 3D neural network model and enhance the stability of the artificial intelligence system. At present, most 3D adversarial attack methods perturb the entire point cloud to generate adversarial examples, which results in high perturbation costs and low operability in the physical world. In this paper, we propose an adaptive local adversarial attack method (AL-Adv) on 3D point clouds to generate adversarial point clouds. First, we analyze the vulnerability of the 3D network model and extract the salient regions of the input point cloud, namely the vulnerable regions. Second, we propose an adaptive gradient attack algorithm that targets salient regions. The proposed attack algorithm adaptively assigns different disturbances in different directions of the three-dimensional coordinates of the point cloud. Experimental results show that our proposed AL-Adv method achieves a higher attack success rate than the global attack method. Specifically, the adversarial examples generated by AL-Adv demonstrate good imperceptibility and small generation costs.

   Feature fusion network
AB Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years; however, deep learning methods face significant challenges on long-tailed datasets, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. In a long-tailed dataset, there are many more samples in the head classes than in the tail classes, and this class imbalance makes it difficult to learn a good feature representation for both head and tail classes simultaneously, particularly when using a single-stage method. Although the existing two-stage methods can alleviate the problem of single-stage methods not performing well on the tail classes by classifier retraining in the second stage, this does not resolve the problem of insufficient learning of head and tail features. Thus, in this paper, we propose a two-stage feature fusion network (FFN). The proposed FFN addresses this issue using one network for the head classes and another network for the tail classes, each of which is trained with a different loss function. This allows the feature learning module to effectively distinguish between the head and tail classes in the embedding space. The classifier learning module fuses the features obtained from the feature learning module, and the classifier is fine-tuned to classify the input images. Different from traditional two-stage methods, the proposed utilizes different loss functions for the head and tail classes; thus, the classifier can achieve balanced results between the head and tail classes. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets comparing the proposed FFN with six state-of-the-art methods including two baseline methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the FFN achieves significant improvement on all three benchmark datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zxsong999/Feature-Fusion-Network.pytorch.

ID SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PREFERENCE; STRENGTH
AB Multi-criteria decision aiding/making (MCDA/M) approach and three-way decisions (3WD) are embedded into the framework of graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). The objective of this study is to develop more reasonable preference ranking for decision makers (DMs) produced from the perspective of options. This implies further simplification of the underlying computing behind conflict resolution. More specifically, DMs' original option statements are evaluated by hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), then a three-way decisions approach is used to screen out the infeasible and rank the feasible option statements, and the feasible option statements' loss values of three-way decisions approach are determined based on the hesitant fuzzy (HF) evaluation values. In addition, based on the value of conditional probability of the feasible option statements, an improved option prioritization technique with objective weights is developed to efficiently rank the conflict states, so that it can efficiently reflect the intensity of the ranking. Then, considering the preference thresholds of DMs, new definitions of threshold stabilities are proposed. As demonstrated by the case study in the problem of a carbon emission conflict in supply chain under "3060 carbon peak and neutrality" goal in China, the proposed novel three-way decisions graph model for conflict resolution (3WD-GMCR) framework can be widely applied to the realistic scenarios of decision-making. Compared with previous studies, the proposed approach can not only obtain the intensity ranking of conflict states, but also resolve complex large-scale conflicts effectively.

TI Simple multiple kernel k-means with kernel weight regularization*
SO INFORMATION FUSION
LA English
DT Article
DE Multiple kernel clustering; Multi-view clustering; Kernel k-means
AB Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) aims to determine the optimal kernel from several pre-computed basic kernels. Most of MKC algorithms follow a common assumption that the optimal kernel is linearly combined by basic kernels. Based on a min-max framework, a newly proposed MKC method termed simple multiple kernel k-means can acquire a high-quality unified kernel. Although it has achieved promising clustering performance, we have observed that it cannot benefit from any regularization or prior knowledge, thus the learned kernel weight coefficients may be seriously sparse or over-selected. To tackle this issue, we have developed a new algorithm termed simple multiple kernel k-means with kernel weight regularization (SMKKM-KWR), where we introduce average coefficients to avoid too sparse kernel weights. Specially, we add the average kernel coefficients as a regularization term to prevent the learned weight coefficients being far from the average values. After that, an efficient optimization strategy is proposed to solve the new resultant problem. By this way, the unified partition can learn clustering structure from fusion information of all the kernel views, with the goal to reach better clustering performance. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets and four large-scale datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

ID FACE RECOGNITION; SUPERRESOLUTION; FUSION
AB To address the ill-posed problem of hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR), a commonly employed technique is to design a regularization term based on the prior information of hyperspectral images (HSIs) to effectively constrain the objective function. Traditional model-based methods that rely on manually crafted priors are insufficient in fully characterizing the properties of HSIs. Learning-based methods usually use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the implicit priors of HSIs. However, the learning ability of CNN is limited, it only considers the spatial characteristics of the HSIs and ignores the spectral characteristics, and convolution is not effective for long-range dependency modeling. There is still a lot of room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel HSISR method that leverages the Transformer architecture instead of the CNN to learn the prior of HSIs. Specifically, we employ the proximal gradient algorithm to solve the HSISR model and simulate the iterative solution process using an unfolding network. The self-attention layer of the Transformer enables global spatial interaction, while a 3D-CNN is added behind the Transformer layers to better capture the spatio-spectral correlation of HSIs. Both quantitative and visual results on three widely used HSI datasets and the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerable gain compared to all the mainstream algorithms including the most competitive conventional methods and the recently proposed deep learning-based methods.

DE Multi-view disentangled representation; learning; Interpretability of
   multi-view learning; Clustering analysis
AB Multi-view clustering focuses on exploring cluster structures among multiple views and is an effective approach to achieve multi-view information fusion without requiring label supervision. However, multiple views' useful and meaningless information usually is entangled and the latter might cause negative influences in the fusion process. In this paper, we research the interpretability for different information in multiple views and propose a novel method (termed UNTIE) to address their entanglement. Specifically, in UNTIE, discrete view-common variable is introduced to explore all views' common information, and continuous view-private variables are introduced to learn individual views' private information. In this way, the learned representations are disentangled and interpretable where each variable represents a single factor among multi-view data. Then, the useful information in disentangled view-common and view-private representations are leveraged to conduct comprehensive multi-view clustering, making UNTIE can explore common and complementary information from multiple views while obtaining the robustness to meaningless information. Finally, UNTIE has the ability to controllably generate samples and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior representation ability and clustering performance.

DE Image enhancement; Variational method; Retinex model; Non-uniform
   enhancement
AB Image enhancement is a fundamental low-level task of significant importance that can directly affect high-level image processing tasks. Although various methods have been proposed to enhance images, the effectiveness of current methods deteriorates significantly under non-uniform lighting. Since the brightness may vary dramatically in different regions of real-world photos, current methods hardly achieve a good balance between enhancing low-light regions and retaining normal-light regions in the same image. Consequently, either the low-light regions are under-enhanced or the normal-light regions are over-enhanced, while at the same time, color distortion and artifacts are frequently found. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a robust Retinexbased model with reflectance map re-weighting that can improve the brightness level of the low-light image and re-balance the brightness concurrently. We introduce an alternating scheme to solve our proposed model, in which the illumination map, reflectance map, and weighting map are updated iteratively. By utilizing the regularization terms, the noise is well-suppressed during the process. An initialization scheme for the weighting map is also proposed to make our model adaptable to a wide range of light conditions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a variational model with an explicitly constructed re-weighting prior and the associated weighing map concept for the reflectance map. It can estimate the reflectance map, suppress noise, and re-balance the brightness simultaneously. A series of experimental results on a variety of popular datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its superiority in enhancing real low-light images when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Deep learning algorithms have achieved tremendous success over the past few years. However, the biased behavior of deep models, where the models favor/disfavor certain demographic subgroups, is a major concern in the deep learning community. Several adverse consequences of biased predictions have been observed in the past. One solution to alleviate the problem is to train deep models for fair outcomes. Therefore, in this research, we propose a novel loss function, termed as Uniform Misclassification Loss (UML) to train deep models for unbiased outcomes. The proposed UML function penalizes the model for the worst-performing subgroup for mitigating bias and enhancing the overall model performance. The proposed loss function is also effective while training with imbalanced data as well. Further, a metric, Joint Performance Disparity Measure (JPD) is introduced to jointly measure the overall model performance and the bias in model prediction. Multiple experiments have been performed on four publicly available datasets for facial attribute prediction and comparisons are performed with existing bias mitigation algorithms. Experimental results are reported using performance and bias evaluation metrics. The proposed loss function outperforms existing bias mitigation algorithms that showcase its effectiveness in obtaining unbiased outcomes and improved performance.

ID ATTENTION
AB In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has attracted attention from the research community because of its highly potential applications (such as virtual assistance on intelligent cars, assistant devices for blind people, or information retrieval from document images using natural language as queries) and challenge. The VQA task requires methods that have the ability to fuse the information from questions and images to produce appropriate answers. Neural visual question answering models have achieved tremendous growth on large-scale datasets which are mostly for resource-rich languages such as English. However, available datasets narrow the VQA task as the answers selection task or answer classification task. We argue that this form of VQA is far from human ability and eliminates the challenge of the answering aspect in the VQA task by just selecting answers rather than generating them. In this paper, we introduce the OpenViVQA (Open-domain Vietnamese Visual Question Answering) dataset, the first large-scale dataset for VQA with open-ended answers in Vietnamese, consists of 11,000+ images associated with 37,000+ question-answer pairs (QAs). Moreover, we proposed FST, QuMLAG, and MLPAG which fuse information from images and questions, then use these fused features to construct answers as humans iteratively.

TI KnowleNet: Knowledge fusion network for multimodal sarcasm detection
SO INFORMATION FUSION

DT Article
DE Sarcasm detection; Multimodal learning; Information fusion
ID CLASSIFICATION; SENTIMENT
AB Sarcasm is a form of communication often used to express contempt or ridicule, where the speaker conveys a message opposite to their true meaning, typically intending to mock or belittle a specific target. Sarcasm detection has gained great attention in the field of natural language processing due to the fact that sarcasm is widespread on social media and difficult to detect for machines. While early efforts in sarcasm detection solely relied on textual data, the abundance of multimodal data on social media is also non-negligible. Recent research has focused on multimodal sarcasm detection, where attention mechanisms and graph neural networks were commonly used to identify relevant information in both image and text data. However, these methods may overlook the importance of prior knowledge and cross-modal semantic contrast, which are crucial factors for human sarcasm detection. In this paper, we propose a novel model named KnowleNet that leverages the ConceptNet knowledge base to incorporate prior knowledge and determine image-text relatedness through sample-level and word-level cross-modal semantic similarity detection. Contrastive learning is also introduced to improve the spatial distribution of sarcastic (positive) and non-sarcastic (negative) samples. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicly available benchmark datasets.

AB Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor imagery (MI) is a key topic in the brain-computer interface (BCI). The EEG-based real execution and motor imagery multi-class classification tasks are also crucial, but only a few kinds of literature research it. In addition, classification accuracy still has room for improvement, and the inter -individual variability problems in BCI applications need to be solved. To address these issues, we developed a novel model (RP-BCNNs) that combines the recurrence plot (RP) and Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNNs). First, we employ an RP computation for preprocessed EEG signals of each channel and merge all RPs of all channels into one based on the weighted average method. Then, we feed the RP features into BCNNs to classify 2-class, 3-class, 4-class, and 5-class on real/imaginary movements classification tasks. The results show that the RP-BCNNs model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving average accuracies of 92.86%, 94.12%, 91.37%, 92.61% for real movements and 94.07%, 93.77%, 90.54%, 91.85% for imaginary movements. Our findings suggest that combining complex network methods with deep learning can improve the classification performance of EEG-based BCI systems (e.g., motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epileptic seizure classification).

ID PROPAGATION
AB We consider a novel clustering task in which clusters can have compositional relationships, e.g., one cluster contains images of rectangles, one contains images of circles, and a third (compositional) cluster contains images with both objects. In contrast to hierarchical clustering in which a parent cluster represents the intersection of properties of the child clusters, our problem is about finding compositional clusters that represent the union of the properties of the constituent clusters. This task is motivated by recently developed few-shot learning and embedding models (Alfassy et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021) that can distinguish the label sets, not just the individual labels, assigned to the examples. We propose three new algorithms - Compositional Affinity Propagation (CAP), Compositional k-means (CKM), and Greedy Compositional Reassignment (GCR) - that can partition examples into coherent groups and infer the compositional structure among them. We show promising results, compared to popular algorithms such as Gaussian mixtures, Fuzzy c-means, and Agglomerative Clustering, on the OmniGlot and LibriSpeech datasets. Our work has applications to open-world multi-label object recognition and speaker identification & diarization with simultaneous speech from multiple speakers.

ID LEARNING ENSEMBLE; PREDICTION; NETWORK
AB Nowadays, predictive models based on a time series are widely used in many fields, from geology to healthcare and from traffic management to industrial production. One of the most important tasks in machine and deep learning is designing predictive algorithms that provide increasingly reliable and accurate forecasts from a time series. This work proposes a novel ensemble approach to producing predictions in a multivariate framework. Its main idea is to reduce data dimensionality through an encoding technique, with the aim to extract useful information via single predictive procedures and then to gather all the processed data through a combiner to give the final forecast. In our framework, the combiner is composed of a hybrid neural architecture: a Convolutional Neural Network to extract local patterns from the predictions and a Recurrent Neural Network to infer information about the temporal patterns of the time series. Furthermore, a fully connected network is adopted to merge these two components and to provide the prediction. Extensive experiments on different datasets, both public and private, related to different applications have been carried out. Comparisons of the errors with conventional methods and state-of-the-art strategies confirm both accuracy and robustness of the proposed ensemble. Finally, we also show a comparison in terms of computational time, both in the hyperparameter optimization and forecasting tasks.

DE Few-shot learning; Dictionary learning; Cross-Domain; Collaborative
   representation
AB In Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification, researchers mainly utilize models which trained with source domain tasks to adapt to the target domain with very few samples, thus causing serious class-difference-caused domain differences. Although researchers have proposed methods to minimize the domain differences, the existing methods have the following drawbacks: 1) most models do not utilize the common knowledge between the source and target domains, and 2) require additional labeled samples from the target domain for finetuning or domain alignment, which is hard to obtain in reality. To address the problem mentioned above, we propose a class-shared and class-specific dictionaries (CSCSD) learning method. To make better utilization of the common knowledge, we apply a class-shared dictionary which is learned to represent the generality of source and target domain. Moreover, class-specific dictionaries are applied to represent the class-specific knowledge that can't be represented in the class-shared dictionary. Furthermore, unlike most other models, our CSCSD does not require additional target domain samples to meta-train or finetune. With the dictionaries, CSCSD can obtain more distinguishable collaborative representations of samples with the origin representations extracted with the model. To evaluate the effectiveness of CSCSD, we utilize larger datasets, e.g., MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet as source domains and fine-grained datasets, e.g., CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae as target domains. With our CSCSD, the Cross-Domain Few-Shot accuracy exceeds most domain adaptive Few-Shot which utilizes additional training set in target domains.

Radiomics applications, however, pose several challenges from the computational viewpoint, and their effective deployment in real-world scenarios require to carefully put in place a number of sophisticated information fusion algorithms and approaches. The paper overviews some relevant works in this area, by depicting a clear picture of the current trends in information fusion methods defined at the level of the data sources as well as at the level of the models learned for diagnostic purposes. While the potential of radiomics to enhance established diagnostic, prognostic and even therapeutic approaches in different diseases merged rather clearly, the analysis evidences several issues that require to attract further attention in the research community.

AB In the area of clustering, multi-view clustering has drawn a lot of research attention by making full use of information from different views. In many practical applications, collecting complete multi-view data without missing views is sometimes expensive and impossible. Therefore, the study in incomplete multi-view clustering has become a trend in the field of clustering analysis. Graph learning-based approach is one of the most effective tools. The essence of graph learning is how to construct the affinity graph or similarity matrix, whose elements depict the similarity of the corresponding sample pairs. In this paper, we propose a new method, called Neighbor Group Structure Preserving-based Consensus Graph Learning (NGSP_CGL), to learn a high-quality consensus graph for incomplete multi-view clustering. Different from the existing graph learning-based works which only focus on the relationship between isolated sample pairs, NGSP_CGL seeks to explore the neighbor group structure corresponding to the nearest neighbor sets of sample pairs and designs a novel but simple nearest neighbor group structure embedding constraint so as to enhance the quality of consensus graph. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NGSP_CGL.

DE Incomplete multi-view clustering; Topological graph clustering;
   Similarity completion; Low-rank tensor approximation
AB The success of the current multi-view clustering lies in the default assumption of completeness on each view, while it is hardly satisfied for real-world applications. Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) studies clustering multi-view instances that are partially observed due to data corruption or sensor failure. Although making some progress, the current research suffers from the following obstacles: (1) Existing works are always built on pairwise similarity measurement, which cannot fully capture the topological structure of incomplete multi -view samples for precise clustering; (2) Due to the absence of partially-observed samples across multiple views, how could we recover and enhance the high-order similarities across different views becomes one of the main bottlenecks of IMC; (3) Current research mainly aims to handle specific dual-view IMC, which greatly limits the deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Tensorized Topological Graph Learning (TTGL) for the generalized incomplete multi-view clustering, which jointly considers the topological graph construction, missing feature completion, and high-order uncertain correlation enhancement. Specifically, instead of using pairwise similarity measurement, we formulate a consensus topological graph construction module, which can coalesce affinity matrices to analyze the topological structure of incomplete multi-view data. Moreover, we build an iterative missing similarity imputation scheme for feature completion, which ensures the intrinsic similarity preservation on observed instances as well as an imputation on unobserved ones. Furthermore, a low-rank tensor structure is imposed to capture the high-order similarities via both feature and similarity enhancement and completion across different views. Our method can cluster incomplete data with an arbitrary number of views and any missing statuses. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method when compared with a series of state-of-the-art IMC clustering algorithms.

DE Metaheuristic Algorithms; BAT Algorithm; Density-based Clustering;
   Chaotic Strategies
AB BAT algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that depends on the principle of the echolocation behavior of bats. However, due to poor exploration, the algorithm suffers from being stuck in the local optima. An improved BAT algorithm based on the density-based clustering technique is proposed to enhance the algorithm's performance. In this paper, the initial population is improved by generating two populations, randomly and depending on the clusters' center information, and by getting the fittest individuals from these two populations, the initial improved one is generated. The random walk function is improved using chaotic maps instead of the fixed-size movement, so the local search is improved, as well as the global search abilities, by diversifying the solutions. Another improvement is dealing with stagnation by partitioning the search space into two parts depending on the generated clusters' information to obtain the newly generated solution, comparing their quality with the previously generated solution, and choosing the best. The performance of the proposed improved BAT algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with the original BAT algorithm over ten benchmark optimization test functions. Depending on the results, the improved BAT outperforms the original BAT by obtaining the optimal global solutions for most of the benchmark test functions.

DE Recommender systems; Fairness; Trustworthiness; Survey
AB As information filtering services, recommender systems have extremely enriched our daily life by providing personalized suggestions and facilitating people in decision-making, which makes them vital and indispensable to human society in the information era. However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarize existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight the connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender systems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while advocating for fairness. Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems.

DE Multimodal sentiment analysis; Multimodal representation learning;
   Contrastive learning; Multimodal humor detection
ID FUSION
AB The development of technology enables the availability of abundant multimodal data, which can be utilized in many representation learning tasks. However, most methods ignore the rich modality correlation information stored in each multimodal object and fail to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data. To address the aforementioned issue, cross-modal contrastive learning methods are proposed to learn the similarity score of each modality pair in a self-/weakly-supervised manner and improve the model robustness. Though effective, contrastive learning based on unimodal representations might be, in some cases, inaccurate as unimodal representations fail to reveal the global information of multimodal objects. To this end, we propose a contrastive learning pipeline based on multimodal representations to learn from the global view, and devise multiple techniques to generate negative and positive samples for each anchor. To generate positive samples, we apply the mix-up operation to mix two multimodal representations of different objects that have the maximal label similarity. Moreover, we devise a permutation-invariant fusion mechanism to define the positive samples by permuting the input order of modalities for fusion and sampling various contrastive fusion networks. In this way, we force the multimodal representation to be invariant regarding the order of modalities and the structures of fusion networks, so that the model can capture high-level semantic information of multimodal objects. To define negative samples, for each modality, we randomly replace the unimodal representation with that from another dissimilar object when synthesizing the multimodal representation. By this means, the model is led to capture the high-level concurrence information and correspondence relationship between modalities within each object. We also directly define the multimodal representation from another object as a negative sample, where the chosen object shares the minimal label similarity with the anchor. The label information is leveraged in the proposed framework to learn a more discriminative multimodal embedding space for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines on the tasks of multimodal sentiment analysis and humor detection.

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a significant research area in the medical field, enabling the transmission of various types of data to the cloud for analysis and diagnosis. Fusing data from multiple modalities can enhance accuracy but requires substantial computing power. Theoretically, quantum computers can rapidly process large volumes of high-dimensional medical data. Despite accelerated developments in quantum computing, research on quantum machine learning (QML) for multimodal data processing remains limited. Considering these factors, this paper presents a quantum neural network-based multimodal fusion system for intelligent diagnosis (QNMF) that can process multimodal medical data transmitted by IoMT devices, fuse data from different modalities, and improve the performance of intelligent diagnosis. This system employs a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) to efficiently extract features from medical images. These QCNN-based features are then fused with other modality features (such as blood test results or breast cell slices), and used to train an effective variational quantum classifier (VQC) for intelligent diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that a QCNN can effectively extract image data features. Furthermore, QNMF achieved an accuracy of 97.07% and 97.61% on breast cancer diagnosis and Covid-19 diagnosis experiments, respectively. In addition, the QNMF exhibits strong quantum noise robustness.

AB Predicting airport arrival flow serves as a crucial technique in air traffic flow management. Given the unique operational characteristics of air traffic systems, airport arrival flow simultaneously presents complex dynamics in spatial-temporal dimensions, specific spatial heterogeneity, non-rigid periodicity, and robust plannability. These factors pose challenges to existing modeling methods in achieving optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel large-range air traffic flow prediction model to forecast airport arrival flow. More specifically, a dynamic multi-graph neural network is designed to automatically capture the time-evolving and heterogeneous spatial correlations using convolution and attention operations. In terms of the temporal dimension, a temporal-aware attention module is constructed to extract the temporal transitions of traffic data, considering both the local context and stationarity of the traffic representation sequence. Furthermore, a prior-guided recalibration fusion module is employed to explicitly incorporate the prior knowledge, including historical-periodic and future-scheduled arrival flow features, to recalibrate the temporal module prediction results, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy. Experimental results on a real-world airport traffic flow dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, and all proposed technical modules contribute to desired performance improvements.

AB In this paper, aperiodic intermittent control (AIC) is presented for the fixed-time synchronization of delayed dynamic networks. To overcome the difficulty that the AIC strategy cannot solve the fixed-time synchronization of delayed dynamic networks directly, the concept of anaverage intermittent control interval is proposed. Based on this average concept and by constructing an auxiliary function, a new lemma is given, which is used to study the fixed-time synchronization of dynamic networks. The upper/lower bound restrictions on each control width for AIC input are relaxed using average intermittent control. A novel Lyapunov function is proposed, and flexible criteria are established for finite-time/exponential synchronization of general dynamic networks using the average intermittent control strategy. The relationship between the average control interval and intermittent interval with afixed-time is given. Finally, typical networks are used to show the validity of our AIC approach.

AB Unsupervised feature selection is an important machine learning task and thus attracts increasingly more attention. However, due to the absence of labels, unsupervised feature selection often suffers from stability and robustness problems. To tackle these problems, some works try to ensemble multiple feature selection results to obtain a consensus result. Most of the existing methods do the ensemble on the feature level, i.e., they directly ensemble feature selection results by feature ranking or voting aggregation, without paying any attention to the following downstream tasks. In this paper, we take clustering as the downstream task and wish to ensemble the base results to select features which are appropriate for clustering. To this end, we propose a novel bi-level feature selection ensemble method, which ensembles on two levels: the feature level and the clustering level. Together with feature level ensemble, we also learn a consensus clustering result from base feature selection results with self-paced learning. Then, we apply the consensus clustering result to guide the feature selection in turn. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art feature selection and feature selection ensemble methods in the clustering task. The codes of this paper are released in https://doctor-nobody.github.io/codes/BLFSE.zip.

   Knowledge enhancement; Neural networks
AB Identifying temporal and subevent relationships between different events (i.e., event relation extraction) is an important step towards event-centric natural language processing, which can help understand how events evolve and potentially facilitate many downstream tasks, such as timeline generation and event knowledge graph construction. Existing work has extensively leveraged external knowledge to improve the performance of relation extraction. Despite the progress made, the current knowledge-enhanced approach still has some shortcomings, e.g., knowledge missing, knowledge noise, and suboptimal knowledge injection. In this paper, we propose OntoEnhance, a novel event relation extraction framework that fuses semantic information from event ontologies to enhance event representation. Specifically, we first inject the latent knowledge in the event ontology into the prompt text to address the issue of knowledge missing. Then a dual-stack attention fusion mechanism is further introduced to enhance the injection of key knowledge to alleviate knowledge noise. In order to prevent the knowledge in the event ontology from being wrongly dominated, we use the event direction induction mechanism to obtain the event context-based relational sequence representation. Finally, a gate mechanism is used to fuse ontology-based knowledge and context-based event features dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OntoEnhance outperforms all comparison baselines by a large margin on all four datasets under both standard and few-shot settings.

AB The popularity of employing neural networks in diverse academic, scientific endeavors, and industrial applications is on the rise. In addition to moving forward in neural networks, there has been a great interest in modeling human behavior and activity patterns to recognize particular events. Various methods have so far been proposed for building expert vision systems to understand the scene and draw true semantic inferences from the observed dynamics. However, classifying abnormal or unusual activities in real-time video sequences is still challenging, as the details in video sequences have a time continuity constraint. A cost-effective approach is still demanding, and so this work presents an advanced three-dimensional convolutional network (A3DConvNet) for detecting abnormal behavior of persons by analyzing their actions. The network proposed is 15 layers deep that uses 18 convolutional operations to effectively analyze the video contents and produces spatiotemporal features. The integrated dense layer uses these features for the efficient learning process, and the softmax layer is used as the output layer for labeling the sequences. Additionally, we have created a dataset that carries video clips to represent abnormal behaviors of humans in megastores/shops, which is a consequent contribution of this paper. The dataset includes five complicated activities in the shops/megastores: normal, shoplifting, drinking, eating, and damaging. By analyzing human actions, the proposed algorithm produces an alert if anything like abnormalities are found. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on the synthesized dataset, achieving an accuracy of up to similar to 91%.

AB In real world, a large number of networks are heterogeneous, containing different types of semantics and connections. Existing studies typically only consider lower-order pairwise relations rather than higher-order group interactions. Furthermore, they tend to focus more on node attributes rather than graph structural information. This results models failing to maintain graph topology effectively, which reduces the effectiveness on link prediction. To address these limitations, we propose Neighborhood Overlap-aware Heterogeneous hypergraph neural network (NOH) that learns useful structural information from the heterogeneous graph and estimates overlapped neighborhood for link prediction. Our model fuses the heterogeneity of graphs with structural information so that the model maintains both lower-order pairwise relations and higher-order complex semantics. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that NOH consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on link prediction.

ID QUANTUM; STATE
AB Quantum two-level systems, i.e., qubits, form the basis for most quantum machine learning approaches that have been proposed throughout the years. However, higher dimensional quantum systems constitute a promising alternative and are increasingly explored in theory and practice. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems, so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels, the qudit states, and the operators employed to encode the data are well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the elementary operators and show that a squeezing operator is necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum hardware. The findings of our work support the notion that qudit-based algorithms exhibit attractive traits and constitute a promising route to increasing the computational capabilities of quantum machine learning approaches.

DE Dispersion measure; Fuzzy set; Fuzzy number; Variance; Decision making
ID DECISION-MAKING; RANDOM-VARIABLES; MEAN-VALUE; VARIANCE
AB In this paper, based on the analysis of the most widely used dispersion measure in the real context (namely, the variance), we introduce the notion of fuzzy dispersion measure associated to a finite set of data given by fuzzy numbers. This measure is implemented as a fuzzy number, so there is no loss of information caused by any defuzzification. The proposed concept satisfies the usual properties in a genuinely fuzzy sense and it avoids limitations in terms of its geometric shape or its analytical properties: under this conception, it could have a piece of its support in the negative part of the real line. This novel notion can be interpreted as a way of fusing the information included in a fuzzy data set in order to make a decision based on its dispersion. To illustrate the main characteristics of this approach, we present an example of a fuzzy dispersion measure that allows to conclude that this new way to deal this problem is coherent, at least, from the point of view of human intuition.

AB During the process of obtaining a consensus, the moderator may recommend modifications based on his personal interests to steer decision-makers (DMs) toward modifying their viewpoints so that the consensus evolves in the desired direction. In the process of revising opinions, the moderator must provide sufficient monetary remuneration to those who are willing to modify their opinions. Nevertheless, there is a lot of uncertainty and both internal and external factors affect the adjustment cost of decision-making. This paper proposes two robust optimal consensus feedback mechanisms with private interests in the context of uncertain cost (UCRFM), taking into account the moderator's private interests and uncertain cost, minimizing the consensus cost under the established consensus threshold, and maximizing the fuzzy consensus measure under the given cost budget. Initially, two types of UCRFMs are presented by employing two uncertainty sets to characterize the uncertain cost, and then two UCRFMs are turned equivalently into a 0-1 programming model. Secondly, based on different uncertainty sets, the corresponding robust counterparts of UCRFMs are constructed to obtain the optimal total consensus cost and the maximum fuzzy consensus. Finally, comprehensive experimental research is conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and a comparison between the models is given.

AB Recommender systems are crucial in the big data era, effectively mitigating information overload. Existing recommendation methods are limited on highly sparse data and have mediocre recall performance. Group influence aggregates knowledge from different users or organizations to generate decisions, improving information fusion efficiency and group decision-making quality. In this paper, a group influence-based deep adversarial autoencoder (GI-AAE), is proposed for top-N recommendation. It leverages group influence to strengthen autoencoder latent features and address sparse data and uses adversarial learning from GANs to enhance reconstruction. The group influence based deep autoencoder (GI-AE) is the generative model for the GI-AAE. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive and gets higher recall values.

   consistency; Layer normalization; Benchmark dataset
AB To tackle the challenge of vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) in complex lighting environments and diverse scenes, multi-spectral sources like visible and infrared information are taken into consideration due to their excellent complementary advantages. However, multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID suffers cross-modality discrepancy caused by heterogeneous properties of different modalities as well as a big challenge of the diverse appearance with different views in each identity. Meanwhile, diverse environmental interference leads to heavy sample distributional discrepancy in each modality. In this work, we propose a novel cross-directional consistency network (CCNet) to simultaneously overcome the discrepancies from both modality and sample aspects. In particular, we design a new cross-directional center loss (������������������������) to pull the modality centers of each identity close to mitigate cross-modality discrepancy, while the sample centers of each identity close to alleviate the sample discrepancy. Such a strategy can generate discriminative multi-spectral feature representations for vehicle Re ID. In addition, we design an adaptive layer normalization unit (ALNU) to dynamically adjust individual feature distribution to handle distributional discrepancy of intra-modality features for robust learning. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform, we create a high-quality RGB-NIR-TIR multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID benchmark (MSVR310), including 310 different vehicles from a broad range of viewpoints, time spans and environmental complexities. Comprehensive experiments on both created and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach comparing to the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code will be released for free academic usage at https://github.com/superlollipop123/Cross-directional-Center-Networkand-MSVR310.

AB We present a new table structure recognition (TSR) approach, called TSRFormer, to robustly recognize the structures of complex tables with geometrical distortions from various table images. Unlike previous methods, we formulate table separation line prediction as a line regression problem instead of an image segmentation problem and propose a new two-stage dynamic queries enhanced DETR based separation line regression approach, named DQ-DETR, to predict separation lines from table images directly. Compared to Vallina DETR, we propose three improvements in DQ-DETR to make the two-stage DETR framework work efficiently and effectively for the separation line prediction task: 1) A new query design, named Dynamic Query, to decouple single line query into separable point queries which could intuitively improve the localization accuracy for regression tasks; 2) A dynamic queries based progressive line regression approach to progressively regressing points on the line which further enhances localization accuracy for distorted tables; 3) A prior-enhanced matching strategy to solve the slow convergence issue of DETR. After separation line prediction, a simple relation network based cell merging module is used to recover spanning cells. With these new techniques, our TSRFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR, PubTabNet, WTW, FinTabNet, and cTDaR TrackB2-Modern. Furthermore, we have validated the robustness and high localization accuracy of our approach to tables with complex structures, borderless cells, large blank spaces, empty or spanning cells as well as distorted or even curved shapes on a more challenging real-world in-house dataset.

AB A close temporal coordination of actions and goals is crucial for natural and fluent human-robot interactions in collaborative tasks. How to endow an autonomous robot with a basic temporal cognition capacity is an open question. In this paper, we present a neurodynamics approach based on the theoretical framework of dynamic neural fields (DNF) which assumes that timing processes are closely integrated with other cognitive computations. The continuous evolution of neural population activity towards an attractor state provides an implicit sensation of the passage of time. Highly flexible sensorimotor timing can be achieved through manipulations of inputs or initial conditions that affect the speed with which the neural trajectory evolves. We test a DNF-based control architecture in an assembly paradigm in which an assistant hands over a series of pieces which the operator uses among others in the assembly process. By watching two experts, the robot first learns the serial order and relative timing of object transfers to subsequently substitute the assistant in the collaborative task. A dynamic adaptation rule exploiting a perceived temporal mismatch between the expected and the realized transfer timing allows the robot to quickly adapt its proactive motor timing to the pace of the operator even when an additional assembly step delays a handover. Moreover, the self-stabilizing properties of the population dynamics support the fast internal simulation of acquired task knowledge allowing the robot to anticipate serial order errors.

AB Online shopping experiences should be simplified by incorporating essential features such as virtual try-on clothing and recommending new items based on the customer's preferences. This is necessary given the rapid growth of the fashion industry and the expansion of shopping technologies. In this paper, we propose a new approach integrating fashion image retrieval and recommendation with a 3D virtual try-on network. We aim to build an interactive attributes-preserving model that allows users to choose the favourite garments and virtually try them on after uploading a frontal image of the whole body. Several deep learning architectures are used to extract and learn the key attributes of garment image, by which each formulated image is subjected to effective human body segmentation and pose estimation procedures. Then, a 3D VTON network is used to generate a 3D image of the user wearing a specific garment, after which the fashion retrieval system recommends and ranks more relevant items. Extensive experiments on multi-domain fashion dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of fashion retrieval and attribute relevancy, achieving a top@30 accuracy of 80.02%, an NDCG@30 of 80.26%, and a top@30 mAP of 87.71%. Additionally, the generated generic image descriptors require very little memory space, enabling rapid online learning and retrieval of large-scale 3D images.

AB Cerebral palsy (CP) is used to describe a group of disorders, characterized by non-progressive, but permanent damage to the developing brain that results in motor deficits, functional difficulties, sensory impairments, and cognitive impairments. AI is rapidly developing with special importance to education and healthcare. Interdisciplinary research perspectives and applications have come up as a helping hand to meet out the needs in different paradigm of Assessment and Biomedicine. At this juncture, building assessment tools for people with motor coordinate impairment is a valuable yet novel research challenge. So, authors implement a handwritten digit recognition system using optical character recognition (OCR) on dataset of CP people's handwritten digits and based on study the problem statement is defined to detect variation in jerking hands on written to optical digits by proposing a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture on the augmented dataset (CP handwritten data). The proposed research will look into a variety of design preferences for CNN-based handwritten digit recognition, including kernel size, layer count, stride size, and dilation. In addition, it evaluated the confusion matrix for maximum number prediction using various optimization algorithms. The extensive trials were conducted and obtained 85% accuracy for the CP dataset and 97% for the MNIST dataset.

   Content-based image retrieval
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB The main challenge of image retrieval systems is to retrieve similar samples in a way that can be interpreted in a semantic relationship with the user's query image. In recent years, deep neural networks, due to their remarkable role in extracting the content and semantic features of the image, have been at the center of attention for image retrieval. Processing occurs in deep neural networks, at multiple levels, and with a pyramid approach. This characteristic allows the extraction of semantic and high-level features from the image. On the other hand, the image content features can be extracted with high interpretability using handcraft features. Therefore, in the proposed approach, by fusing features and adding extra information sources, handcraft features are semantically enhanced. In this approach, handcraft features including color and texture are extracted from the semantic pyramid of the deep neural network. The semantic pyramid is the result of the fusion of feature maps in different levels of deep neural networks. Additionally, in this approach, feature vector interpretability is also considered. The t-SNE technique has been used to interpret the discriminability of the feature vector between the classes of the database. Also, the silhouette criterion has been introduced to study the degree of intra-class compatibility and inter-class dataset samples discriminability with feature vector.

DE Image recommendation; Style features; Content features; Iterative
   perturbation; Adversarial training
AB The vulnerability of Machine Learning (ML) models to adversarial attack and their prominence pose security issues, notably in image recommendation systems. The adversarial training method is an excellent strategy for improving the generalization capacity of ML models by creating attacks in the embedding space during training. While there has been a plethora of testing on image recommendation system vulnerabilities and defenses, iterative adversarial training methodologies have received little attention. Furthermore, when browsing visual images, consumers are more interested in the content and how well the image style matches the content. However, when compared to image content, the impact of image styles on the adversarial recommendation community has rarely been examined. In this work, we propose a robust Adversarial Content and Style Bayesian Personalized Ranking (ACSBPR) approach that leverages content and style features for image recommendation. The ACSBPR technique makes three significant contributions: (1) Incorporate content and style features jointly for image recommendation. (2) Present a multi-objective pairwise ranking with Dynamic Negative Sampling to optimize the system and anticipate consumer preferences. (3) To reduce the influence of the attack, we train the ACSBPR objective function using minimax iterative adversarial training. Extensive investigations on the Flickr dataset demonstrate that our strategy achieves better performance when compared to state-of-the-art image recommendation models.

AB We report on a consistent comparison between techniques of quantum and classical machine learning applied to the classification of signal and background events for the Vector Boson Scattering processes, studied at the Large Hadron Collider installed at the CERN laboratory. Quantum machine learning algorithms based on variational quantum circuits are run on freely available quantum computing hardware, showing very good performances as compared to deep neural networks run on classical computing facilities. In particular, we show that such kind of quantum neural networks is able to correctly classify the targeted signal with an Area Under the characteristic Curve (AUC) that is very close to the one obtained with the corresponding classical neural network, but employing a much lower number of resources, as well as less variable data in the training set. Albeit giving a proof-of-principle demonstration with limited quantum computing resources, this work represents one of the first steps towards the use of near term and noisy quantum hardware for practical event classification in High Energy Physics experiments.

AB Concepts are central to reasoning and intelligent behaviour. Scientific evidence shows that conceptual development is fundamental for the emergence of high-cognitive phenomena. Here, we model such phenomena in a brain-inspired cognitive robotic model and examine how the robot can learn, categorise, and abstract concepts to voluntary control behaviour. The paper argues that such competence arises with sufficient conceptual content from physical and social experience. Hence, senses, motor abilities and language, all contribute to a robot's intelligent behaviour. To this aim, we devised a method for attaining concepts, which computationally reproduces the steps of the inductive thinking strategy of the Concept Attainment Model (CAM). Initially, the robot is tutor-guided through socio-centric cues to attain concepts and is then tested consistently to use these concepts to solve complex tasks. We demonstrate how the robot uses language to create new categories by abstraction in response to human language-directed instructions. Linguistic stimuli also change the representations of the robot's experiences and generate more complex representations for further concepts. Most notably, this work shows that this competence emerges by the robot's ability to understand the concepts similarly to human understanding. Such understanding was also maintained when concepts were expressed in multilingual lexicalisations showing that labels represent concepts that allowed the model to adapt to unfamiliar contingencies in which it did not have directly related experiences. The work concludes that language is an essential component of conceptual development, which scaffolds the cognitive continuum of a robot from low-to-high cognitive skills, including its skill to understand.

AB Barren plateaus appear to be a major obstacle for using variational quantum algorithms to simulate large-scale quantum systems or to replace traditional machine learning algorithms. They can be caused by multiple factors such as the expressivity of the ansatz, excessive entanglement, the locality of observables under consideration, or even hardware noise. We propose classical splitting of parametric ansatz circuits to avoid barren plateaus. Classical splitting is realized by subdividing an N qubit ansatz into multiple ansatze that consist of O(log N) qubits. We show that such an approach allows for avoiding barren plateaus and carry out numerical experiments, and perform binary classification on classical and quantum datasets. Moreover, we propose an extension of the ansatz that is compatible with variational quantum simulations. Finally, we discuss a speed-up for gradient-based optimization and hardware implementation, robustness against noise and parallelization, making classical splitting an ideal tool for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) applications.

AB Reliable estimation of future cost prices of stocks are a significant and exciting task in both educational and economic research. Current progressions in machine learning (ML), and explicitly, in the area of deep learning (DL) have permitted the research community to utilize the financial information from the social and finance websites to estimate the future prices of products in a viable manner. Besides, the accurate estimation of stock future trends is a complex task due to the unstable nature of the finance data. We have tried to overcome the limitations of existing studies by presenting a more reliable DL-based approach. More clearly, the proposed work is based on estimating the final prices of products by utilizing the 10 years of stock data from the Yahoo Finance website along with the computed Stock Technical Indicators (STIs). The calculated STIs are initially passed as input to the autoencoder to reduce the feature space by eliminating the highly correlated data and providing a more nominative set of STIs. The processed STIs together with the Yahoo finance data are passed as input to the DenseNet-41. The final feature vector computed by the DenseNet-41 is then passed to the SoftMax layer of the network to determine the closing cost prices of products for small, medium, and longtime horizons. Based on the predicted prices of stocks the proposed approach provides three types of signals designated as buy, sell, or hold to assist the investors in their decision-making. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our work outperforms the latest methods by acquiring a minimum MAPE score of 0.32.

AB Casting is the main backbone of the manufacturing industry in which liquefied metal is put into the desired shape of mold for the reshaping of metal. Hence, casting defect analysis is an essential tool for manufacturers to ensure the quality of their products, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In this research, an ensemble model is proposed for casting defect analysis by ensembling transfer learning ResNet50 model and proposed Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model. The transfer learning ResNet50 is chosen after analysing the performance of four models i.e. EfficientNetB3, ResNet18, VGG16 and ResNet50. The feature maps extracted from two different models ResNet50 and CNN are weighted ensemble by grid search combination of weights, weight1 and weight2 assigned to these two models respectively to design a hybrid feature map. With the aid of ensemble model, overfitting can be mitigated, which pool the knowledge of numerous models that have been trained on separate portions of the data. The model is implemented using the Kaggle dataset having 7348 images of two different casting classes of defective and non-defective. The proposed ensemble model is simulated and analyzed using three hyper-parameters i.e. optimizers, batch size, and epochs. The proposed ensemble model outperforms the two individual models with the value of optimizer as Adam, batch size as 32, and epochs as 30. The values of precision and accuracy for the ensemble model come out to be 99.89% and 98.18% respectively.

AB Recent years have witnessed significant interest in few-shot segmentation methods, with the aim of predicting novel categories in a query image given the limited labeled support set. Despite demonstrated successes, some existing methods might suffer from the intra-class inconsistency between query and support samples for local unidirectional information guidance. We propose a hierarchical bidirectional aggregation with prior guided transformer for abundant intra-class common cues. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate support and query features by a non-local bidirectional information flow in a hierarchical manner to derive a closer and deeper correlation. We further introduce the prior affinity map to impart inductive bias and eliminate interfering semantics. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses some previous state-of-the-art approaches well, especially performing favorably in handling challenging situations under 1-shot setting.

AB In the current multimodal retrieval field, CoOp is the preferred approach among many models due to its simplicity and powerful adaptive capability. However, CoOp focuses primarily on optimizing prompts to perform contrast learning, without considering image-text interactions and the impact on the model when visual information is incorporated into the prompts. In this work, we propose a prompt tuning method for simulating image-text interaction based on CoOp: Decoding context optimization (DeCoOp). Through extensive experiments on 11 image classification datasets, seven datasets under the few-shot setting and all 11 datasets under the zero-shot setting are ahead of CoOp in our method. Experiments on four target datasets of ImageNet show a model performance improvement of more than 10%, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms the baseline model CoOp in terms of point domain generalization and robustness. In addition, ablation experiments performed on three representative datasets confirmed the effectiveness and further improvement of the accuracy of DeCoOp. Finally, experiments are performed on 11 datasets using different visual backbones, and it is not difficult to find that the gap between our approach and handcrafted prompts is large in all architectures and shows better performance than CoOp.

AB Student engagement is positively related to comprehension in teaching-learning process. Student engagement is widely studied in online learning environments, whereas this research focuses on student engagement recognition in classroom environments using visual cues. To incorporate learning-centered affective states, we curated a dataset with six learning-centered affective states from four public datasets. A graph convolution network (GCN)-based deep learning model with attention was designed and implemented to extract more contributing features from input video for student engagement recognition. The proposed architecture was evaluated on curated as well as four public datasets. An ablation study was conducted on a curated dataset, the best performing model with minority oversampling and focal cross-entropy loss achieved 65.35% accuracy. We also estimated the student engagement in authentic classroom data, and it showed a positive correlation between students' engagement levels and post-lesson test scores with a Pearson's coefficient value of 0.64. The proposed method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods on two of the public datasets with accuracy scores of 99.20% and 56.17%, and it achieved accuracy scores of 64.92% and 56.17% on other two public datasets which are better than many baseline results on them.

AB In recent years, more and more researchers employ the hashing algorithm to improve the large-scale cross-modal retrieval efficiency by mapping the floating-point feature into the compact binary code. However, the cross-modal hashing algorithm usually computes the similarity relationship based on single class labels, while ignoring the multi-label information. To solve the above problem, we propose the deep adversarial multi-label cross-modal hashing algorithm (DAMCH) which takes both multi-label and deep feature into consideration during establishing the cross-modal neighbor matrix. Firstly, we propose the inter- and intra-modal neighbor relationship preserving function to make the Hamming neighbor relationship be consistent with the original neighbor relationship. Secondly, we design linear classification functions to learn binary features' semantic labels and establish the hash semantic preserving loss function to guarantee the binary features have the same semantic information as the original label. Furthermore, we establish the intra-modal adversarial loss function to minimize the information loss during mapping the floating-point feature into the compact binary code, and propose the inter-modal adversarial loss function to ensure different modal features own the same distribution. Finally, we conduct the cross-modal retrieval comparative experiments and the ablation studies on two public datasets MIRFickr and NUS-WIDE. The experimental results show that DAMCH outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Region and grid features extracted by object detection networks, which contain abundant image information, are widely used in visual question answering (VQA). The regions focus on object-level features, but the grids are better at representing contextual information and fine-grained attributes of images. However, most of the existing VQA models process visual information with one-way attention, failing to capture the internal relations between objects and analyze the feature details. In this work, we propose a novel multi-level collaborative decoder (MLCD) layer based on the encoder-decoder framework to address this issue, which incorporates visual location vectors into attention. Specifically, each MLCD is equipped with three different attention-MLP sub-modules to progressively and accurately mine the intrinsic interactions of features and enhance the influence of image content on prediction results. Additionally, to fully exploit the respective advantages of two features, we propose a novel relativity-augmented cross-attention (RACA) unit and add it to MLCD, in which the features after simple attention are complementarily augmented using global information and self-attributes. To validate the proposed methods, we stack the MLCD layer deeply to constitute our dual-feature collaborative relation-attention network (DFCRAN). We conduct extensive experiments and visualize the results on three benchmark datasets, including COCO-QA, VQA 1.0, and VQA 2.0, to prove the effectiveness of our model and achieve competitive performances compared to the state-of-the-art single models without pre-training.

AB This paper introduces a modified version of a genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation (GAAM), one of the genetic algorithms (GAs) used for feature selection. The modification proposed in this study expands the original GAAM's capabilities by allowing not only feature selection but also feature reduction. To obtain this effect, we applied the concept of ranks used in the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and the concept of penalty term used in the Holland genetic algorithm. With those two concepts, we managed to balance the importance of two competing criteria in the GAAM fitness function: classification accuracy and the feature subset's size. To assess the algorithm's effectiveness, we evaluated it on eleven datasets with different characteristics and compared the results with eight reference methods: GAAM, Melting GAAM, Holland GA with a penalty term, NSGA-II, Correlation-based Feature Selection, Lasso, Sequential Forward Selection, and IniPG (an algorithm for particle swarm optimisation). The main conclusion drawn from this study is that the genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation and decreasing feature set (GAAMmf) introduced in this paper returned feature sets with a significantly smaller number of features than almost all reference methods. Furthermore, GAAMmf outperformed most of the methods in terms of classification accuracy (except the original GAAM). In contrast to Holland GA and NSGA-II, GAAMmf was able to perform the feature reduction task for all datasets, regardless of the initial number of features.

AB Boosting is an ensemble learning method that converts a weak learner into a strong learner in the PAC learning framework. The AdaBoost algorithm is a well-known classical boosting algorithm for weak learners with binary hypotheses. Recently, Arunachalam and Maity presented the first quantum boosting algorithm by quantizing AdaBoost. Their algorithm, which we refer to as QAdaBoost hereafter, is a quantum adaptation of AdaBoost and only works for the binary hypothesis case. QAdaBoost is quadratically faster than AdaBoost in terms of the VC dimension of the hypothesis class of the weak learner. However, QAdaBoost is polynomially worse in the bias of the weak learner. In this work, we address an open question by Izdebski et al. on the existence of boosting algorithms for quantum weak learners with non-binary hypotheses. We answer this question in the affirmative by developing the QRealBoost algorithm motivated by the classical RealBoost algorithm. The main technical challenge was to provide provable guarantees for convergence, generalization bounds, and quantum speedup, given that quantum subroutines are noisy and probabilistic. We prove that QRealBoost retains the quadratic speedup of QAdaBoost over AdaBoost and further achieves a polynomial speedup over QAdaBoost in terms of both the bias of the learner and the time taken by the learner to learn the target concept class. Finally, we perform empirical evaluations on QRealBoost and report encouraging observations on quantum simulators by benchmarking the convergence performance of QRealBoost against QAdaBoost, AdaBoost, RealBoost, and SmoothBoost on a subset of the MNIST dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

DE Quantum neural networks; Machine learning; Variational quantum circuits
AB There is an increasing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models, how they work and for which applications they could be useful. There have been many different proposals on how classical data can be encoded and what circuit ansatze and measurement operators should be used to process the encoded data and measure the output state of an ansatz. The choice of the aforementioned operators plays a determinant role in the expressive power of the QML model. In this work we investigate how certain changes in the circuit structure change this expressivity. We introduce both numerical and analytical tools to explore the effect that these operators have in the overall performance of the QML model. These tools are based on previous work on the teacher-student scheme, the partial Fourier series and the averaged operator size. We focus our analysis on simple QML models with two and three qubits and observe that increasing the number of parameterized and entangling gates leads to a more expressive model for certain circuit structures. Also, on which qubit the measurement is performed affects the type of functions that QML models could learn. This work sketches the determinant role that the processing and measurement operators have on the expressive power of simple quantum circuits.

   clustering; Action recognition
AB Action recognition is a video understanding task that is carried out to recognize an action of an object in a video. In order to recognize the action, it is necessary to extract motion information through temporal modeling. However, videos typically contain high temporal redundancy, such as iterative events and adjacent frames. This high temporal redundancy weakens information related to actual action, making it difficult for the final classifier to recognize the action. In this article, we focus on preserving helpful information for action recognition by reducing the high temporal redundancy in videos. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel frame selection method called cluster-guided frame selection (CluFrame). Specifically, CluFrame compresses an input video into keyframes of clusters discovered by applying k-means clustering to frame-wise features extracted from pre-trained 2D-CNNs in the temporal compression (TC) module. In addition, CluFrame selects keyframes related to the action of the input video by optimizing the TC module based on the action recognition results. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CluFrame addresses the high temporal redundancy in the video and achieves action recognition accuracy improvement over existing action recognition methods by up to 6.6% and by about 0.7% compared to state-of-the-art frame selection methods.

AB The efficient resolution of optimization problems is one of the key issues in today's industry. This task relies mainly on classical algorithms that present scalability problems and processing limitations. Quantum computing has emerged to challenge these types of problems. In this paper, we focus on the Metropolis-Hastings quantum algorithm, which is based on quantum walks. We use this algorithm to build a quantum software tool called Quantum Metropolis Solver (QMS). We validate QMS with the N-Queen problem to show a potential quantum advantage in an example that can be easily extrapolated to an Artificial Intelligence domain. We carry out different simulations to validate the performance of QMS and its configuration.

AB Several applications of quantum machine learning (QML) rely on a quantum measurement followed by training algorithms using the measurement outcomes. However, recently developed QML models, such as variational quantum circuits (VQCs), can be implemented directly on the state of the quantum system (quantum data). Here, we propose to use a qubit as a probe to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity of the environment. Using VQCs, we find an optimal sequence of qubit-environment interactions that yield accurate estimations of the degree of non-Markovianity for the amplitude damping, phase damping, and the combination of both models. This work contributes to practical quantum applications of VQCs and delivers a feasible experimental procedure to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Accurate carbon price forecasting is important for investors and policymakers to make decisions in the carbon market. With the development of quantum computing in recent years, quantum machine learning has shown great potential in a wide range of areas. This paper proposes a hybrid quantum computing based carbon price forecasting framework using an improved quantum machine learning model. The proposed linear-layer-enhanced Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (L-QLSTM) model employs the linear layers before and after the variational quantum circuits of Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), to extract features, reduce the number of quantum bits and amplify the quantum advantages. The parameter sharing method of the linear layer and the strongly entangled controlled-Z quantum circuit of the variational layer are applied to reduce the parameters and improve the learning performance respectively. We test and evaluate the L-QLSTM based on the practical data of European Union Emission Trading from 2017 to 2020. Results show that the proposed L-QLSTM method can greatly improve the learning accuracy compared to the QLSTM method.

AB Quantum computing has shown the potential to substantially speed up machine learning applications, in particular for supervised and unsupervised learning. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, has become essential for solving many decision-making problems and policy iteration methods remain the foundation of such approaches. In this paper, we provide a general framework for performing quantum reinforcement learning via policy iteration. We validate our framework by designing and analyzing quantum policy evaluation methods for infinite-horizon discounted problems by building quantum states that approximately encode the value function of a policy, and quantum policy improvement methods by post-processing measurement outcomes on these quantum states. Last, we study the theoretical and experimental performance of our quantum algorithms on two environments from OpenAI's Gym.

AB Time series prediction is essential for human activities in diverse areas. A common approach to this task is to harness recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, while their predictions are quite accurate, their learning process is complex and, thus, time and energy consuming. Here, we propose to extend the concept of RRNs by including continuous-variable quantum resources in it and to use a quantum-enhanced RNN to overcome these obstacles. The design of the continuous-variable quantum RNN (CV-QRNN) is rooted in the continuous-variable quantum computing paradigm. By performing extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantum network is capable of learning-time dependence of several types of temporal data and that it converges to the optimal weights in fewer epochs than a classical network. Furthermore, for a small number of trainable parameters, it can achieve lower losses than its classical counterpart. CV-QRNN can be implemented using commercially available quantum-photonic hardware.

TI Faster quantum state decomposition with Tucker tensor approximation
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DE Quantum state preparation; Tensor decomposition; NISQ; Tucker
   decomposition
AB Researchers have put a lot of effort into reducing the gap between current quantum processing units (QPU) capabilities and their potential supremacy. One approach is to keep supplementary computations in the CPU, and use the QPU only for the core of the problem. In this work, we address the complexity of quantum algorithms of arbitrary quantum state initialization. QPUs do not outperform classical machines with existing precise initialization algorithms. Hence, many studies propose an approximate but robust quantum state initialization. Cutting a quantum state into a product of (almost) independent partitions with the help of CPU reduces the number of two-qubit gates, and correspondingly minimizes the loss of state fidelity in the quantum part of the algorithm. To find the least entangled qubits, current methods compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) for each qubit separately using the CPU. In this paper, we optimize CPU usage and memory resource bottlenecks. We consider Tucker tensor decomposition as an alternative to the CPU-based SVD in a single low-entangled qubit detection task without loss of solution quality. An iterative implementation of Tucker tensor decomposition replaces explicit applications of SVD as proposed in Araujo et al. (2021). This improvement gives both a theoretical and practical time complexity reduction for the circuit-preparation part of quantum algorithms working with vector data. We propose two implementations of our method; both of them outperform the SVD in time and memory for systems of at least ten qubits. We achieve an order faster implementation and two orders less memory usage for a system of 15 qubits.

DE Quantum autoencoders; Quantum cloud computing; Quantum gate
AB In the model of quantum cloud computing, the server executes a computation on the quantum data provided by the client. In this scenario, it is important to reduce the amount of quantum communication between the client and the server. A possible approach is to transform the desired computation into a compressed version that acts on a smaller number of qubits, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between the client and the server. Here we propose quantum autoencoders for quantum gates (QAEGate) as a method for compressing quantum computations. We illustrate it in concrete scenarios of single-round and multi-round communication and validate it through numerical experiments. A bonus of our method is it does not reveal any information about the server's computation other than the information present in the output.

AB State-of-the-art deep learning systems (e.g., ImageNet image classification) typically require very large training sets to achieve high accuracies. Therefore, one of the grand challenges is called few-shot learning where only a few training samples are required for good performance. In this survey, we illuminate one of the key paradigms in few-shot learning called meta-learning. These meta-learning methods, by simulating the tasks which will be presented at inference through episodic training, can effectively employ previous prior knowledge to guide the learning of new tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and key insights into the meta-learning approaches and categorize them into three branches according to their technical characteristics, namely metric-based, model-based and optimization-based meta-learning. Due to the major importance of the evaluation process, we also present an overview of current widely used benchmarks, as well as performances of recent meta-learning methods on these datasets. Based on over 200 papers in this survey, we conclude with the major challenges and future directions of few-shot learning and meta-learning.

AB In this paper we study the viability of solving the Chinese Postman Problem, a graph routing optimization problem, and many of its variants on a quantum annealing device. Routing problem variants considered include graph type, directionally varying weights, number of parties involved in routing, among others. We put emphasis on the explanation of how to convert such problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. QUBO is one of two equivalent natural paradigms for quantum annealing devices, the other being the Ising Model. We also expand upon a previously discovered algorithm for solving the Chinese Postman Problem on a closed undirected graph to decrease the number of constraints and variables used in the problem. Optimal annealing parameter settings and constraint weight values are discussed based on results from implementation on the D-Wave 2000Q and Advantage. Results from classical, purely quantum, and hybrid algorithms are compared.

AB Norms are useful tools to regulate autonomous agents, and their generality is the focus of this paper. The generality of norms refers to the extent of behaviors the norms are capable of regulating. While very specific norms tend to be inefficient to avoid undesirable behaviors (since they are rarely activated), very general norms tend to limit excessively the options of the agents (since they are activated too often) hindering them to achieve the system goals. Therefore, a norm that efficiently regulates the agents should have a balanced generality, being neither too specific nor too general. Therefore, we consider that exploring the generality of norms is a fundamental key to obtaining efficient norms. However, the evaluation of their generality usually considers every behavior they regulate. Since it is likely an unfeasible task, in this paper, we investigate alternatives to estimate the norms generality from their syntactic characteristics. Based on these characteristics, we obtain different sequences of norms that vary approximately from the most specific to the most general. We assume thus that norms with a balanced generality are more easily found considering these orderings. Therefore, it is relevant to understand the impact of the syntactical characteristics in ordering the norms. In this context, we found out how different alternatives organize the norms space. This result is particularly useful for the development of algorithms for searching efficient norms that, through different strategies, may exploit how norms space is arranged and pruned.

AB Clustering algorithms are widely used for segmenting medical images. However, these techniques can be challenging to perform, especially when working with magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain. The complexity of the brain tissue's anatomical structure, the inhomogeneity of the pixel intensity in these images, and the effects of partial volume and noise can make clustering difficult, leading the algorithm to fall into local minima. To address this issue, it is recommended to improve clustering algorithms by using optimization techniques to achieve better results. In this study, we propose a developed clustering algorithm and optimize it using a tree seed algorithm (TSA) for segmenting brain MRI images. The algorithms are tested on real brain image datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed and optimized methods yield satisfactory results according to the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), compared to the fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm.

ID MANIPULATION
AB Face manipulation technology is rapidly evolving, making it impossible for human eyes to recognize fake faces in photos. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) discriminators, on the other hand, can quickly achieve high accuracy in distinguishing fake from real face photos. In this paper, we investigate how CNN models distinguish between fake and real faces. According to our findings, face forgery detection heavily relies on the variation in the texture of the images. As a result of the aforementioned discovery, we propose a deep texture variation network, a new model for robust face fraud detection based on convolution and pyramid pooling. Convolution combines pixel intensity and pixel gradient information to create a stationary representation of composition difference information. Simultaneously, multi-scale information fusion based on the pyramid pooling can prevent the texture features from being destroyed. The proposed deep texture variation network outperforms previous techniques on a variety of datasets, including Faceforensics++, DeeperForensics-1.0, Celeb-DF, and DFDC. The proposed model is less susceptible to image distortion, such as JPEG compression and blur, which is important in this field.

AB Plant identification and classification are critical to understand, protect, and conserve biodiversity. Traditional plant classification requires years of intensive training and experience, making it difficult for others to classify plants. Plant leaf classification is a challenging issue as similar features appear in different plant species. With the development of automated image-based classification, machine learning (ML) is becoming very popular. Deep learning (DL) methods have significantly improved plant image identification and classification. In the last decade, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have entirely dominated the field of computer vision, showing outstanding feature extraction capabilities and significant identification and classification performance. The capability of CNN lies in its network. The primary strategy to continue this trend in the literature relies on further scaling networks in size. However due to increase in network size, costs increase rapidly, while performance improvements may be marginal. Hence, there is a need to optimize the CNN network to get the desired result with optimal size of machine learning model. This paper proposes a parallel big bang-big crunch (PB3C) based approach to automatically evolve the architecture of CNN. The proposed approach is validated on plant leaf classification application and compared with other existing machine learning-based approaches. From the comparision results we observed that the obtained it was found that the proposed approach was able to outperforms all the 11 existing state-of-the-art techniques.

TI Dynamic Multi-view Group Preference Learning for group behavior

AB Group behavior modeling is an important research topic in the field of social network analysis. Existing methods regarding this topic can only learn the static group preference, ignoring the multiple characteristics of the group behavior, so they cannot model the group behavior in a complete way. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-view Group Preference Learning (DMGPL) model for group behavior prediction in social networks. Firstly, an area-aware user dynamic preference extracting module is developed concerning user representation learning, which can integrate the dynamic user behavior preference and the corresponding group structural information into group members' representations. Then, to simultaneously obtain stability, propensity, potentiality, and heterogeneity of the group behavior, Multi-view Group Preference Aggregation (MGA) is designed for group behavior modeling. In MGA, various aggregation strategies are used to capture different kinds of group behavior properties, which can achieve the effect of highlighting different properties in different scenarios. Moreover, considering the influence of the member's size on group behavior, we define the group scaling degree and perform group representation scaling to make MGA more flexible. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, and the results show that the accuracy of group behavior prediction by DMGPL improved by about 10% compared to the baseline models.

AB The probabilistic interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets (PIVHFSs), being able to generalize interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets embedded with the decision makers (DMs)' preferences for different elements, can depict uncertain decision information completely and precisely. Therefore, with this study, we propose an extended Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) III method based on regret theory and Borda rule under a PIVHFS environment, which has the advantage of considering the regret psychology of the DMs and subordinate ranking orders. Using the proposed methodology, a fuzzy bidirectional projection measure is developed to overcome the shortcoming of unidirectional projection. The proposed method is validated by two numerical examples, and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through sensitivity and comparative analyses.

AB Digital video stabilization aims to remove camera motion jitters through software implementation. The first step of the classical video stabilization methodology is called camera motion estimation, which is usually performed using only RGB frames of the unstable video. Despite recent advances in camera motion estimation strategies, methods classified as two-dimensional are still not properly evaluated, even though it is well known that motion estimation is a crucial step for classical approaches to video stabilization. The main purpose of this work is to draw attention to two-dimensional camera motion estimation assessment and reinforce its importance on video stabilization progress. We proposed a new approach to perform this evaluation using camera motion fields in a pixel-by-pixel comparison and demonstrated through experimental results that our metrics are reliable for diverse scenarios comparing them to image similarity metrics. In addition, we showed and analyzed the results of our metrics for a global and a local method of camera motion estimation. We believe that our assessment and study presented in this work is an important starting point for a more rigorous analysis of this task. In addition, this can be a foundation for coming 2D camera motion estimation methods based on deep learning.

AB This article focuses on the quasi-projective synchronization for a class of non-identical memristor-based complex-valued recurrent neural networks (MCVRNNs) with time-varying delays and parameters' mismatched. Here, the quasi-projective synchronization is presented in two ways based on the Halanay inequality and some useful techniques. Some novel sufficient conditions are firstly derived for quasi-projective synchronization criteria of non-identical memristor-based CVRNNs with time-varying delays and parameters' mismatched by using the matrix measure method. And then, by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, another sufficient stabilization condition for quasi-projective synchronization of the concerned model is presented. Finally, two numerical simulation results are given to demonstrate the usefulness and persistence of the proposed methods under some conditions.

DT Article
DE Relation classification; Few-shot learning; Domain adaptation;
   Prototypical network
AB Few-shot relation classification aims to predict the relation between entity pairs in unseen sentences with a few labeled sentences. In real-world scenarios, the target domains often have limited data and could differ significantly from the source domains. Existing studies focus on the representation of entity pairs, ignoring the relation between the sentences and the entity pairs. Some researchers use feature-adaptive methods that do not consider that features contribute differently to relation classification. To solve these challenges, a multi-transformer based on a prototypical enhancement network (MTPEnet) is presented for few-shot relation classification with domain adaptation in this study. Specifically, for MTPEnet, two main parts are conducted. First, in the calculation of the prototype, a local and global representations (LGR) module is established to improve the representation of sentences. LGR considers not only the head and tail entities in a sentence but also the relation between the entity pair and the entire sentence. Second, a multi-transformer (MT) feature transformation module is introduced to address the cross-domain problem. Different weights are assigned to the target domain features according to the degree of fusion between the features in the target and source domains. Finally, the experimental results on the datasets FewRel 2.0 and FewTAC demonstrate the superiority of MTPEnet over several baseline models.

AB In this paper, a novel YOLO-based detection model with deformable convolution network (DCN-YOLOv5) is developed, which is concerned with the object and key points detection and behavior tracking problem for Oplegnathus punctatus in the ammonia nitrogen environment. The proposed model can adapt to the posture change of the object by deforming the receptive field, which solves the problem of false and missed detection caused by the movement and occlusion. Moreover, a new multi-object multi-category tracking algorithm (MOMC-Tracking) is proposed to track and plot the trajectory and calculate the key behavioral characteristics parameters. In addition, an executable software which integrates the proposed DCN-YOLOv5 model and the MOMC-Tracking algorithm is proposed. Extensive experiments show that compared with the typical YOLO series of algorithms, the proposed model in this paper performs the best with the highest accuracy and the fastest convergence speed, where the mAP @0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of the proposed DCN-YOLOv5 model are 93.71% and 57.45%, which are respectively improved by 1.78% and 24.77% as compared with those obtained by the original YOLOv5 model.

These methods have to deal with singularities in the multilabel data, such as the occurrence of frequent and infrequent labels in the same instance. Implementations of these methods are sometimes limited to the pseudocode provided by their authors in a paper. This Original Software Publication presents mldr.resampling, a software package that provides reference implementations for eleven multilabel resampling methods, with an emphasis on efficiency since these algorithms are usually time-consuming.

AB In this paper, the global synchronization of fractional complex-valued neural networks with pantograph delays and inhibitory factors is investigated, and some sufficient conditions are obtained. It deserves to mention that the attained sufficient conditions show that some factors including the pantograph coefficient, coupling connection weights, inhibitory factors, and the order of fractional derivative have an influence on network synchronization. Moreover, when complex-valued neural networks degenerate into real-valued cases and inhibitory factors are not taken into consideration, they are also discussed, and two corollaries are derived. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the theoretical results, a numerical example is presented. Meanwhile, some contrastive numerical results are given to illustrate the relationships among network synchronization, pantograph coefficient, and inhibitory factors.

AB Normalization is a mandatory preprocessing step in time series problems to guarantee similarity comparisons invariant to unexpected distortions in amplitude and offset. Such distortions are usual for most time series data. A typical example is gait recognition by motion collected on subjects with varying body height and width. To rescale the data for the same range of values, the vast majority of researchers consider z-normalization as the default method for any domain application, data, or task. This choice is made without a searching process as occurs to set the parameters of an algorithm or without any experimental evidence in the literature considering a variety of scenarios to support this decision. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of different normalization methods on time series data. Our analysis is based on an extensive experimental comparison on classification problems involving 10 normalization methods, 3 state-of-the-art classifiers, and 38 benchmark datasets. We consider the classification task due to the simplicity of the experimental settings and well-defined metrics. However, our findings can be extrapolated for other time series mining tasks, such as forecasting or clustering. Based on our results, we suggest to evaluate the maximum absolute scale as an alternative to znormalization. Besides being time efficient, this alternative shows promising results for similarity-based methods using Euclidean distance. For deep learning, mean normalization could be considered.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the robust prescribed-time containment control with prescribed-time extended state observer is addressed for high-order multi-agent systems with model uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a prescribed-time distributed observer is developed for each follower to estimate the convex hull spanned by the states of the leaders. Namely, it can generate the reference tracking signal for each follower. Furthermore, since only the output of each follower is available and its dynamics is inevitably disturbed by diverse uncertainties and disturbances, a prescribed-time extended state observer is developed for estimation. In addition, a robust prescribed-time containment controller is put forward to realize the containment control. Then the proposed strategy is successfully applied to the wheeled mobile robots. Finally, experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be effective in detecting fraud within social networks by gathering information from neighboring nodes to predict fraudulent actions. However, the continuous evolution and camouflaging tactics of fraudsters, such as establishing malicious connections with legitimate users and mimicking their behaviors, can often elude GNNbased detection methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-order moments graph transformer, named MMGT, to effectively learn node representations through an attention mechanism that captures information of different orders of moments. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a self-adaptive malicious relation filtering model for fraud detection, denoted as SFGT. Initially, we form a multi-relational graph that encapsulates complex relations within a given social network and derive node representations by accumulating neighbor node and edge data based on an enhanced graph transformer. Subsequently, a threshold-based malicious relation filter mechanism is proposed to eliminate malicious links by assessing the distance between nodes. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold learning policy is developed to bolster the model's performance and its ability to generalize. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on two public datasets, Amazon and YelpChi, which underscores the effectiveness of our proposed model. The experimental results indicate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB How to enable intelligent machines to possess human commonsense knowledge is one of the central concerns of artificial intelligence. Consequently, a series of commonsense knowledge bases have been designed and constructed by scholars. However, as an important kind of commonsense knowledge, adjective-centric commonsense knowledge (a crucial type of adjective-concept pair such as (blue, sky), (eatable, food)) is far from satisfactory due to the lack of existing knowledge bases and limited acquisition methods. In this paper, we concentrate on automatically constructing large-scale adjective-centric commonsense knowledge bases and propose an effective framework to achieve the goal. The framework mainly contains a filtering module to remove unreasonable inputs, a clustering module, and a conceptualization module to obtain adjective-concept pairs and an evaluation module to assess their plausibility. Extensive automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we finally harvest over 200 k adjective-centric commonsense knowledge, where 81.56% of the implicit commonsense knowledge is not covered by WebChild.1 Moreover, we also show that our mined adjective-centric commonsense knowledge can benefit the downstream query conceptualization task.

TI Value function optimistic initialization with uncertainty and confidence
   awareness in lifelong reinforcement learning
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Reinforcement learning; Knowledge transfer; Lifelong learning;
   Optimistic initialization
AB We study the case of value function initialization in a reinforcement learning agent that deals with a set of tasks varying in terms of reward and sampled in a lifelong manner. The existing works tackling this setting of transfer reinforcement learning often consider a uniform sampling of tasks in their experiments, while optimistically transferring the knowledge by using the maximum seen outcome. However, due to the uncertainty of the real world, infrequent events cause the distribution to be non-uniform. As a consequence, the optimistic initialization seems impractical because it gives equally high importance to both frequent and infrequent tasks causing sample complexity to increase. We argue that to overcome such limitation, the agent must be able to assess how optimism is influenced by its uncertainty and confidence; two intercorrelated notions that play a crucial role in decision-making. Therefore we propose a novel approach UCOI (Uncertainty and Confidence aware Optimistic Initialization) that applies optimism only in adequate situations and we prove that our approach shows advantageous results over the existing works, especially for tasks coming from a non-uniform distribution.

DE Transformer; Medical image segmentation; Attention mechanism
ID NETWORKS
AB Convolutional neural networks(CNN), especially U-shaped networks, have become the mainstream approach for medical image segmentation. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolutional operations, CNN has inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Although Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision by modeling long-range dependencies, their high computational complexity and reliance on large-scale pre-training present challenges, particularly for higher-resolution medical images. In this paper, we introduce MAXFormer, a U-shaped hierarchical network that effectively leverages global context within individual samples and relationships between different samples. Our Transformer module reformulates the self-attention mechanism into two parts: local-global attention and external attention. The local-global attention provides an efficient alternative to self-attention with linear complexity, employing a parallel architecture that allows local-global spatial interactions. The local attention branch captures high-frequency local information, while the global attention branch captures low-frequency global information. Furthermore, we have designed the Refined Fused Connection module to effectively merge feature outputs from each encoder block with the decoder output, mitigating spatial detail loss due to downsampling. Extensive experiments on two different medical image segmentation datasets show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods without requiring pre-training weights. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhiwei-liang/MAXFormer.

TI Semantic-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Session-based recommendation; Self-supervised learning; Contrastive
   learning
AB Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next clicked item based on the short-term behavior sequence of an anonymous user, which is a challenging task owing to data sparsity. Although contrastive learning has been used extensively to address this problem, existing methods generally consider all other sessions in the mini-batch as negative samples, leading to a limited negative sample space and a failure to distinguish real negative samples from false negative samples. Thus, Semantic-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation (SCLRec) is proposed in this study. Specifically, a queue is designed to store session samples, and a momentum encoder is used to ensure high consistency in the large-capacity sample space. Furthermore, a novel semantic-enhanced mechanism is devised to filter out false negative samples and increase the weights of high-confidence negative samples according to semantic similarity scores between sessions, effectively reducing noise and enhancing contrastive learning. Moreover, the gated attention unit is used as the encoder to obtain excellent performance and efficiency compared with traditional attention networks. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relatively low time complexity.

ID FRAMEWORK; FACE
AB Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a powerful supervised dimensionality reduction method for analysing high-dimensional data. However, LDA cannot use locality information in data, which makes LDA degrade dramatically in performance on multimodal data. A number of LDA variants have been proposed to exploit locality information in data, including subclass-based LDAs. We discover a problem with these variants, which is that subclasses are selected on a within-class basis without considering other classes. This causes the loss of important information at class boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel variant of subclass-based LDA, Global Subclass Discriminant Analysis (GSDA). Unlike other subclass-based LDAs, GSDA selects subclasses from global clusters that may cross class boundaries, thus utilising within-class information and between-class information. More specifically, GSDA applies an effective clustering algorithm to the whole data to construct global clusters. It then utilises the local structure refining strategy on these global clusters to construct subclasses. Finally, GSDA learns a representative data subspace by maximising inter-subclass distance and minimising intra-subclass distance simultaneously. GSDA is extensively evaluated on a wide range of public datasets through comparison with the state-of-the-art LDA algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority in terms of accuracy and run times.

AB Suitable selection of a proximity measure is one of the fundamental requirements of clustering. With conventional (dis)similarity measures, many clustering algorithms do not yield satisfactory results on complex high-dimensional datasets. The problem lies with widely varying distributions along each feature which existing (dis)similarity measures fail to capture. In this work, we study the distribution of all-pair absolute distances in some standard real datasets over the feature space and observe that most of them have values near to zero. The frequency of data pairs decreases with the increasing value of distance which suggests an exponential distribution of values along features. The exponential decay rate constant, termed as characteristic length indicates the inhomogeneity in a feature and therefore, we use it as a weighting factor across attributes. The dissimilarity for a pair of data points is computed by considering the weights of each attribute along with a continuum adaptation of Boltzmann's notion of entropy which uses feature-wise absolute differences as input. We prove that the proposed measure is a metric. For experimental analysis, we compare different proximity measures with the proposed, in terms of clustering results. The combination of feature wise characteristic length and the continuous version of Boltzmann's entropy proves its excellence in terms of clustering results on diversified synthetic, real, and gene expression datasets.

AB When it comes to machine learning on graphs, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) is a potent tool. By iteratively propagating neural messages along the edges of the input graph, GNNs integrate node feature information with graph structure. Nonetheless, not all neighborhood data is valuable. Some of the neighbor data may not be necessary for the downstream task. For a controlled and relevant information aggregation, we propose a flexible method OOF-GNN (Over-smoothing and Over-squashing Free Graph Neural Network). The main notion of this technique is to limit the impact of irrelevant and excessive information propagation during message passing. An extensive discussion of the theoretical and experimental justifications, associated with this method is presented. This technique works on all baseline models (e.g. GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT). It allows them to gather information from the K-hop neighborhood without node information being over-smoothed and over-squashed. The efficacy of OFF-GNN in addressing the challenges of under-reaching, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, as well as improving the performance of GNN models in node classification tasks, has been demonstrated through comprehensive experimentation on both academic benchmarks and real-world datasets.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Digital ecosystems reinforce the commercial achievements of digital innovations, providing organizations with platforms to implement digital products by sharing, co-developing, and using application programming interfaces (APIs) as digital resources. The use of APIs in digital ecosystems formulates dynamic API networks that evolve with the emergence of APIs and their updates. API network dynamics are associated with disruptive technology, heterogeneous networks, product and service innovation, and entrepreneurial success. However, methods for measuring and predicting API network dynamics have not been developed. We developed a framework for measuring and predicting the API network dynamics generated by APIs. To develop the abovementioned framework, we invented three network embeddings that could represent and measure API network dynamics and a prediction model based on a deep learning approach that could forecast API network dynamics. We conducted multiple experiments to assess the performance and usability of our method framework, and the results consistently demonstrate that our developed approach surpasses existing methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Spatiotemporal interactive learning
AB Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting holds significant importance in decision-making for complex real-world phenomena. However, the presence of nonlinear temporal correlations within variables and dynamic spatial correlations between variables makes accurate MTS prediction challenging. Currently, there are many researchers who build various spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) and apply them to this field. However, most existing methods construct the graph structure using a single type of information and separately capture temporal and spatial features. These factors can result in models that fail to extract complete spatiotemporal features, thereby limiting their performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the dynamic spatiotemporal interactive graph neural network (DSTIGNN), a novel STGNN for MTS forecasting. The proposed dynamic graph inference module models the dynamic spatial association between variables by fusing two types of heterogeneous information and is combined with the dynamic graph convolution module to propagate information in spatial dimensions. Meanwhile, downsampling operations and multiple sample convolution modules are used to jointly capture multiresolution temporal correlations. Subsequently, these modules are integrated into a spatiotemporal interactive learning framework, enabling the synchronous capture of temporal and spatial features. We have performed numerous experiments on six benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that DSTIGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most of the contemporary research published in field of visible-short wave near-infrared (Vis- SWNIR) fruit spectroscopy is 'derivative' in nature as they primarily showcase the application of existing spectroscopic devices coupled with traditional multivariate analysis techniques subjected to different fruits. The results of such studies often remain theoretical due to lack of integration mechanisms to incorporate developed models back into these proprietary devices. In present study, an open-source portable spectrophotometer has been proposed using commercially available multi-spectral sensor chipset integrated with microcontroller, housed in an ergonomically designed cabinet for spectral data acquisition in reflectance mode. During a 15-day post-harvest storage study of over 100 samples of raw tomatoes, the spectral data was acquired at 18 different wavelengths ranging from 410 nanometer (nm) to 940 nm, along with laboratory estimation 14 physicochemical attributes. Statistical and chemometrics analysis revealed that blue (380-440 nm) and green (440-600 nm) spectra varied with attributes associated with loss in water content, while red (600-750 nm) and SWNIR (750-1100 nm) spectra varied with attributes associated with carotenoid content, such as lycopene, antioxidant activity, and colour pigmentation. In order to predict physicochemical attributes using spectral wavelengths as regressor variables, various linear models including multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and non-linear models including random forest regression (RF), support vector machine regression (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) were developed using 10-fold cross-validation on 80-20% train-test split of the dataset. MLR was observed to have exhibited a linear relationship between lycopene and wavelengths 560 nm, 645 nm and 730 nm with highest coefficient of determination (R-2) among linear models at 0.6361 (p < 0.05) but SVM outperformed all models with root mean squared error on test dataset, RMSE (Test) at 0.087 (p < 0.05). MLR was found to be best suitable for prediction of red colour pigmentation in tomatoes with 93.17% accuracy and lowest RMSE (Test) at 0.0608 (p < 0.05) for wavelengths 560 nm, 645 nm, 730 nm and 810 nm. While non-linear models demonstrated competence in capturing the underlying relationship between physicochemical attributes and spectra the optimised MLR models, albeit time and computationally dearer due to extensive pre-processing and criterion-based selection strategies, showed outstanding performance with high R-2 and competitive RMSE (Test). Additionally, these MLR models offered interpretability to facilitate better understanding of spectral features that were influential in making predictions of carotenoid associated attributes, which is often absent in contemporary research papers. The present work augments technological advancement in portable fruit spectroscopy for rapid and non-invasive estimation of physicochemical attributes through chemometrics-machine learning framework.

DE Fidelity; Equivariance; Data augmentation; GCN; Graph neural network
AB Graph data augmentation is widely used in machine learning, and when serving the underlying model, it is necessary to ensure that the feature-graph-label tuples are consistent before and after augmentation. To this end, controlling the fidelity of graph data augmentation to satisfy such consistency becomes a fundamental issue. To date, some graph data augmentation literature has discussed the importance of augmenting fidelity, but few theoretical guarantees have been provided. Here we theoretically ensure the fidelity by introducing the notion of aug-equivariance, based on its classical counterpart of equivariance. In our work, we first provide conditions to ensure that Graph Convolution Network is aug-equivariant with respect to the proposed transformations for both data and label distributions. Based on the derived conditions, we propose a novel graph data augmentation framework named E-Aug. The framework enables both edges and features to be augmented under the constraints of aug-equivariance, and the E-Aug-enhanced data does not damage the features and topology of the original graph. We experimentally applied E-Aug to various architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our E-Aug models can consistently improve or closely match state-of-the-art results across four established graph benchmarks:the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as the Europe air traffic network dataset.

AB Oil spills are considered to be one of the worst catastrophes that occur in the marine environment and it is obligatory to remediate oil spills. The preset paper focuses on the adsorptive removal of oil spills from synthetic water using human hair, a potent natural adsorbent. Diesel was used as a representative of the spilled oils. Both batch and column studies were conducted and the maximum adsorptive capacity of hair was found to be 4.95 g/ g. About 100% removal efficiency was obtained in column studies at 9 cm bed height with initial concentrations up to 20% (v/v). Equilibrium data were fitted to the Freundlich isotherm model and it was found that adsorption obeys the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were employed for the modelling and optimization of the process. The adsorbent dose of 2.52 g with 13.45 min of contact time was found to be optimum to achieve maximum removal efficiency for batch study and 8.85 cm of bed height, 179.51 mL/h flow rate, and 15% of initial concentration were obtained as optimized values of column studies.

AB In the presence of non-modeled components and analyte-matrix interaction in real samples, a combination of second-order multivariate calibration and standard addition is desired to achieve accurate results via secondorder advantage. Enrofloxacin (ENR), Difloxacin (DIF), and Ciprofloxacin (CIP) are Fluoroquinolones widely considered antibiotic residues in milk. Excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of these antibiotics at pH = 9.1 provide second-order data for identifying and quantifying them in a mixture using second-order calibration modeling. Rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCRALS) with trilinearity constraints are applied to determine the CIP, ENR, and DIF residues in synthetic mixtures and milk using second-order excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy. In both methods, the trilinearity constraint guarantees a unique true solution to the spectral profiles of analytes. The combination of second-order standard addition and higher-order calibration modeling with RAFA and MCR-ALS supports the second-order advantage in milk analysis.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have rapidly emerged as valuable tools for chemical research, offering new ways to analyze and understand complex chemical systems. This research article investigates the use of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models to predict the bandgap of transition metal doped zinc oxide (ZnO). The opto-electronic properties of transition metal doped ZnO complexes are of significant interest because of their applications is optoelectronic systems. The MLP and ANFIS models were trained using a dataset of experimentally measured bandgap values and the corresponding structural parameters of the doped ZnO systems. The performance of the models was evaluated using statistical metrics i.e., RMSE, R, and MAE. The results showed that both MLP and ANFIS models were capable of accurately predicting the bandgap of transition metal doped ZnO. However, the ANFIS model demonstrated superior performance with higher accuracy and better generalization ability. The study provides a useful approach for predicting the bandgap of transition metal doped ZnO using machine learning techniques and may contribute to the development of advanced optoelectronic devices.

ID BINARY RELEVANCE; CLASS-IMBALANCE; PERFORMANCE
AB Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) task can be considered the most inclusive description of all classifications tasks, as it joins multiple class spaces and their multiple class members into a single compound classification problem. The challenges in MDC arise from the possible class dependencies across different class spaces, as well as the imbalance of labels in training datasets due to lack of all possible combinations. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, yet efficient, MDC deep learning classifier, named Deep Self-Organizing Cube (DSOC) that can model dependencies among classes in multiple class spaces, while consolidating its ability to classify rare combinations of labels. DSOC is formed of two n-dimensional components, namely the Hypercube Classifier and the multiple DSOC Neural Networks connected to the hypercube. The multiple neural networks component is responsible for feature selection and segregation of classes, while the Hypercube classifier is responsible for creating the semantics among multiple class spaces and accommodate the model for rare sample classification. DSOC is a multiple-output learning algorithm that successfully classify samples across all class spaces simultaneously. To challenge the proposed DSOC model, we conducted an assessment on seventeen benchmark datasets in the four types of classification tasks, binary, multi-class, multi-label and multi-dimensional. The obtained results were compared to four standard classifiers and eight competitive state-of-the-art approaches reported in literature. The DSOC has achieved superior performance over standard classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art approaches in all the four classification tasks. Moreover, in terms of Exact Match accuracy metrics, DSOC has outperformed all state-of-the-art approaches in 77.8% of the cases, which reflects the superior ability of DSOC to model dependencies and successfully classify rare samples across all dimensions simultaneously.

AB Community detection is to divide a graph or a network into several components with high intra-edge density in a single-layer network. However, a multiplex network, consisting of multiple layers which share the same nodes but each owning different types of edges, brings new challenges for community detection. Although many classic algorithms and several multiplex embedding-based models try to address this problem, i.e. community detection in multiplex networks, they mostly focus on the local topological structures but ignoring the global information in each network layer, which is important for encoding intra-layer structural attributes and merging inter-layer semantic relations. In this paper, we propose a graph-enhanced attention model (GEAM) for community detection in multiplex networks by utilizing the above global information. In particular, the GEAM first constructs a layer contrastive learning module to encode node and graph embedding from the local and global graph view in each network layer. We also propose a self-attention adaptive fusion mechanism to learn a comprehensive version of node representation by fusing multiple layers. Finally, we propose an edge density-driven community detection module to train our GEAM in an end-to-end manner and output community divisions with strong modular structures. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superiority of our GEAM over the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of better community detection performance.

AB In image set classification, affine hull based models have achieved good performance. However, these models only focus on holistic images and ignore the local information of images. To incorporate local information, this paper develops a cooperative operator and proposes a cooperative linear regression model (CLRM) for image set classification. Specifically, CLRM first proposes a block partitioning strategy to obtain local information. Image sets and local information are both modeled as affine hulls. Then, a linear regression model embedded with cooperative operator is proposed to incorporate different information and compute the distance between the different affine hulls. Finally, a combined distance measure is proposed to incorporate different information for classification. Extensive experiments on different recognition tasks such as face recognition on image/video based databases and object classification show that the proposed cooperative operator can improve the performance of the model and the proposed CLRM achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers.

AB Power Plants (PPs) is considered as critical facilities in each region because of essential role through energy generation processes. These facilities are also depended to water availability especially in water stress areas. Due to the critical water shortage in many areas around the world, it is necessary to make an optimal condition among water consumption and the increasing demand for electricity to prevent any further conflict of interests between industry, householders and the environmental goals. There are different techniques for controlling Water Consumption (WC) in these industries. This paper develops a smart Decision Support System (DSS) for monitoring, prediction and control sections based on Artificial Intelligent (AI) and integration of the PESTEL matrix and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. Monitoring section comprises Fuel Consumption (FC), Atmospheric Temperature (AT), Power Plant Temperature (PPT) and Power Plant Efficiency (PPE), in which FC has the most influence on WC based on ANOVA evaluations in both cold and warm seasons. The prediction results have illustrated that Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System model is more efficient for the WC estimation with a correlation coefficient over 0.99. Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) also demonstrated that in the optimistic and pessimistic states, the most priority is linked to E3 (Establishment of evaporation control systems by contractor companies and concluding a guaranteed purchase contract with a power plant worth one and a half times the current amount of water price). In the last step of technical approaches, the smart controlling system is added for execution of water-energy nexus in the PP based on proportional-integral-derivative controller system. Finally, the performance of the DSS is approved with more than 80% agreement of experts and more than 90% precision in prediction procedure through this investigation. Application of this DSS can also be helpful for developing countries to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Textual Emotion Analysis (TEA) seeks to extract and assess the emotional states of users from the text. Various Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have emerged rapidly and demonstrated success in numerous disciplines, including audio, image, and natural language processing. The trend has shifted a growing number of researchers from standard machine learning to DL for scientific study. Using DL approaches, we offer an overview of TEA in this paper. After introducing the background for emotion analysis, including the definition of emotion, emotion classification methods, and application domains of emotion analysis, we demonstrated that, despite the immense success of deep learning models in NLP-related tasks, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can lead to incorrect emotion classification. An adversarial text is constructed by altering a few words or characters so as to keep the overall semantic similarity of emotion for a human reader while tricking the machine into making erroneous predictions. This study demonstrates the vulnerability of emotion categorization by generating adversarial text using a variety of cutting-edge attack techniques. Comprehensive experiments are performed to assess the effectiveness of the attack methods against several widely-used models, such as Word-CNN, Bi-LSTM, and four powerful transformer models, namely BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa. These models were trained on an emotion dataset utilized for the purpose of emotion classification. We evaluated and analyzed the behavior of different models under a variety of attack conditions to determine which is the most and least vulnerable. Also, we determine which perturbation technique affects transformer models the most. Using Attack Success Rates (ASR) as our evaluation metric, we have assessed the potential outcomes. The findings reveal that methodologies for classifying emotion prediction can be circumvented, which has implications for existing policy measures.

DE Optical flow estimation; Occlusion; Out-of-boundary scenes;
   Spatiotemporal transformer; 3D convGRU; Separable filters
AB Inaccurate optical flow estimates in and near occluded regions, and out-of-boundary regions are two of the current significant limitations of optical flow estimation algorithms. Recent state-of-the-art optical flow estimation algorithms are two-frame based methods where optical flow is estimated sequentially for each consecutive image pair in a sequence. While this approach gives good flow estimates, it fails to generalize optical flows in occluded regions mainly due to limited local evidence regarding moving elements in a scene. In this work, we propose a learning-based multi-frame optical flow estimation method that estimates two or more consecutive optical flows in parallel from multi-frame image sequences. Our underlying hypothesis is that by understanding temporal scene dynamics from longer sequences with more than two frames, we can characterize pixel-wise dependencies in a larger spatiotemporal domain, generalize complex motion patterns and thereby improve the accuracy of optical flow estimates in occluded regions. We present learning -based spatiotemporal recurrent transformers for multi-frame based optical flow estimation (SSTMs). Our method utilizes 3D Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (3D-ConvGRUs) and spatiotemporal transformers to learn recurrent space-time motion dynamics and global dependencies in the scene and provide a generalized optical flow estimation. When compared with recent state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods on real world and synthetic datasets, performance of the SSTMs were significantly higher in occluded and out-of-boundary regions. Among all published state-of-the-art multi-frame methods, SSTM achieved state-of the-art results on the Sintel Final and KITTI2015 benchmark datasets.

AB Learning interpretable filters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an approach that helps to build models with better generalization ability. Interpretable filters can reveal some hidden aspects of the task and help to improve the model. One of the most successful approaches in the field of the speech processing is SincNet, where the model learns some band-pass filters in the first layer of a CNN with a raw waveform as its input. In this paper, similar to SincNet, some meaningful filters are proposed, which here are inspired by Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. The proposed model uses a phase correction process to ensure that phase linearity is satisfied. The effective length of the truncated IIR filter is calculated based on the accumulated energy, and the effect of changing the filter size on the final results has been investigated. The proposed model is evaluated in the speaker identification task on the TIMIT and Librispeech datasets and compared with traditional CNNs and four interpretable kernel-based models. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model both in performance and convergence speed. Moreover, some patterns of the speech signal, which lead to uniquely identifying a speaker, are analyzed by examining the spectrum of the learned filters.

   Cluster-aware attention mechanism
ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, but the complex dependencies between time-series variables (i.e., inter-series dependencies) make this task extremely challenging. While most existing studies focus on modeling intra-series (temporal) dependencies by capturing longand short-term patterns, they fail to explore and exploit the inter-series dependencies to enhance MTS forecasting. In this paper, we propose a Cluster-aware Attentive Convolutional Recurrent Network (CACRN) to capture both inter-series and intra-series dependencies in MTS data. Specifically, CACRN first introduces a cluster-aware variable representation module that separates irrelevant variables and captures the interaction between relevant variables to learn cluster-aware variable representations. Then, CACRN feeds these representations into parallel convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs) to capture the short-and longterm temporal dependencies in a cluster-wise manner. Next, a cluster-aware attention mechanism is introduced to attend to temporal information in each cluster and co-attend all cluster information jointly to capture intracluster and inter-cluster dependencies for the downstream forecasting task. Our extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that CACRN is effective and outperforms representative and state-of-the-art baselines. Our proposed method is suitable for a wide range of real-world data collections, especially those with clear dependencies of variables.

ID REMOTE STATE ESTIMATION; DETECTION SCHEME
AB This paper investigates the security state estimation issue facing replay attacks in confidential cyber-physical systems. Smart sensor equipped with a power harvester transmits critical measurements to the remote estimator over wireless networks, in which the transmission modes include encrypted and normal. In order to complete the persistent threats, the adversary launches multi-stage discontinuous replay attacks to compromise the estimation process. In virtue of the designed label detection scheme, we transform attack detection into encryption scheduling optimization under the constraint of sensor energy harvesting and acquire a rigorous relationship between detection probability, attack duration, and encryption ratio. Different from most existing studies only focusing on attack detection, the localization of replay interval measured by detection immediacy is also analyzed. Subsequently, the optimal periodic encryption scheduling strategy is given to maximally determine the attack interval by adopting an optimization-based approach. Further, a complete algorithm of replay attack detection, isolation, and recovery (RADIR) is designed to minimize deterioration from multistage attacks, which can guarantee the estimated performance of the system as much as possible. Finally, the unmanned ground vehicle system is applied to validate the theoretical results, where the dataset of replay attacks is obtained by capturing the normal operation data of a moving vehicle. Also, we compare the optimal encryption strategy designed in this paper with general centralized and random scheduling strategies.

AB The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Scientists and medical practitioners have warned that this fatal virus could spread quickly from person to person in its early stages and its impact will be far more vigorous than the previously discovered viruses. The World Health Organization has given warning propaganda to all nations about this harmful virus. However, the diffusion speed of COVID-19 was so rapid that it spread to all countries much faster than the researchers predicted, causing the widespread human disaster. The genetic variations of COVID-19 have also astounded researchers today, as it modifies its mutation with very large genetic strains. The virus is regarded as a human version of the disease, resulting in the common cold, dry cough, and respiratory problems in severe cases. According to health organisations, the coronavirus directly affects the lungs, causing main problems such as difficulty breathing. It is also tough for physicians to diagnose the disease level properly by using the regular process. Even though the virus can be detected in regular testing methods, even computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images are widely used in the medical field to identify the respiratory problems caused by the COVID-19 virus. Like COVID-19, some other types of pneumonia respiratory diseases also affect the human lungs. The fractal dimension (FD) is an interesting non-linear measure to describe the complexity of visual images. In this context, the complexity of X-ray images is analysed by using the fractal dimension. The fractal dimension is an excellent non-linear measurement for describing the complexity of realistic images. The difference between the complexity of the X-ray images of COVID-19-infected patients and the X-ray images of other types of pneumonia respiratory diseases is well explained by using the fractal dimension. It is also concluded that the fractal dimension discriminates the lung diseases due to COVID-19 from various pneumonia respiratory diseases.

AB This paper proposes a new pre-conditioned spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule as well as an efficient system-level time-domain circuit modeling and simulation method for the whole crossbar array structure. First, the new pre-conditioned STDP rule is conceived by exercising a slight perturbation to the conventional STDP curve. Software-wise, it can be described in spiking neural network (SNN) codes, while hardware wise, it is realized by the memristor crossbar array in conjunction with specific spike signals, just as the conventional STDP. The new STDP rule enables the neural network in a neuromorphic chip to achieve better performance both in terms of software and hardware implementation compared with the conventional STDP rule. Second, a time-domain circuit modeling method is proposed for the simulation of the whole crossbar array. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new pre-conditioned STDP is superior to the conventional STDP both in terms of accuracy and low power consumption. At the software level, a 784 x 100 spiking neural network, trained by the pre-conditioned STDP, for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition achieves an accuracy of 85.90%, which is 3.09% higher than that trained by the conventional STDP. At the hardware level, a downscaled 196 x 10 crossbar array is simulated and trained. The crossbar array trained by the new STDP consumes 21.5% less power than that trained by the conventional STDP. Moreover, it does not compromise the original robustness when subject to non-ideal characteristics such as variation of conductance and resistance of the interconnect in the crossbar array.

AB This article develops a multi-view multi-label learning for incomplete data which are ubiquitous with the usage of three kinds of representations including within-view representation, cross-view representation, and consensus-view representation. Different from the recent learning machines, the proposed learning machine takes the feature-oriented information, label-oriented information, and associated information between features and labels in multiple representations together and exploits the hidden useful information of available instances with the usage of instance-instance correlations, feature-feature correlations, label-label correlations, and feature-label correlations. The developed learning machine is named as within- cross-consensus view representation-based multi-view multi-label learning with incomplete data (WCC-MVML-ID). Extensive experiments on multiple multi-view and multi-label data sets with incomplete data validate the effectiveness of WCC-MVML-ID and it can be concluded that (1) WCC-MVML-ID outperforms other compared learning machines and its performances are more stable even though the missing rates of features and labels being larger; (2) compared with within-view information and consensus-view information, cross-view information is more useful for the processing problem about incomplete data; (3) WCC-MVML-ID can converge within 45 iterations.

   Hindsight experience replay; Sparse reward
AB Learning with sparse rewards remains a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, for sequential object manipulation tasks, the RL agent generally only receives a reward upon successful completion of the entire task, leading to low exploration efficiency. To address this sample inefficiency, we propose a novel self-guided continual RL framework, named Relay Hindsight Experience Replay (RHER). RHER decomposes a sequential task into several subtasks with increasing complexity, allowing the agent to learn from the simplest subtask and gradually complete the task. It is crucial that a Self-Guided Exploration Strategy (SGES) is proposed to use the already-learned simpler subtask policy to guide the exploration of a more complex subtask. This strategy allows the agent to break the barriers of sparse reward sequential tasks and achieve efficient learning stage by stage. As a result, the proposed RHER method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark tasks (FetchPush and FetchPickAndPlace). Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of RHER on a variety of single-object and multi-object manipulation tasks (e.g., ObstaclePush, DrawerBox, TStack, etc.). Finally, the proposed RHER method can also learn a contact-rich task on a real robot from scratch within 250 episodes.

AB Homogeneous ensembles are very effective in concept-drift adaptation. However, choosing an appropriate base learner and its hyperparameters suitable for a stream is critical for their predictive performance. Moreover, the best base learner and its hyperparameters may change over time as the stream evolves, necessitating manual reconfiguration. On the other hand, heterogeneous ensembles train multiple base learners belonging to diverse algorithmic families with different inductive biases. Though it eliminates the need to manually choose the best base learner for a stream, their size is often restricted to the number of unique base learner algorithms, limiting their scalability. We combine the strengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles into a unified scalable ensemble framework with higher predictive performance, while eliminating the need to manually specify and adapt the optimal base learner and its hyperparameters for a stream. The proposed ensemble named H3E is a single-pass hybrid algorithm which uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization in combination with stacking to provide high predictive performance at a competitive computational cost. Experiments on several real and synthetic data streams affected by diverse drift types confirm the superior predictive performance and utility of our approach in comparison to popular online ensembles.

AB There is a key issue in the field of stability analysis for fractional-order neural networks (FONNs) concerning whether the exact solution of the FONNs exists under the condition that a series of successive approximate solutions of the models can be obtained. If so, can the state differences between the approximate solutions and the exact solution be estimated? Hyers-Ulam stability, as one of the powerful tools to solve this problem, has attracted the attention of scholars, and various related research achievements have been reported. In view of this, this paper aims to investigate the Hyers-Ulam stability of FONNs with time-varying delays. Using the successive approximation method and the modified retarded Henry-Gronwall integral inequality, several conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the exact solution of FONNs with time-varying delays are derived. Moreover, the corresponding results on the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability of the addressed models are given. Finally, a numerical example is designed to illustrate the efficiency and rationality of the theoretical results.

AB This paper is concerned with the finite-time synchronization (FTS) issue for fractional-order reaction-diffusion complex networks (RDCNs). A finite-time stability principle, which plays a key role in the synchronization analysis later, is developed for fractional-order nonlinear impulsive system. A novel hybrid controller, which consists of a event-triggered controller and a impulsive controller, is designed to realize the global FTS objective for the considered network. By applying the Lyapunov stability theory and the fractional calculus, the global FTS conditions are addressed in the form of algebraic inequalities. In addition, the exclusion of Zeno behavior are proved for the designed event-triggered strategy. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach and the correctness of the theoretical results.

AB Point of Interest (POI) recommendation algorithms can help users find the POIs that they prefer, and they can also help merchants to find potential customers. However, most existing methods still have difficulties effectively utilizing the information in users' check-in data. Significantly, they ignore the intent behind the users' check-in behaviors, which limits the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose an Intent Aware Graph Neural Network-based model(IAGNN) to predict/recommend the next POI with which the target user may interact. Specifically, IAGNN first models the user's check-in behavior sequences as graphs and utilizes the information transmission mechanism of the graph neural network (GNN) to learn the feature vector representation (embedding) of POIs. Second, we devise a hierarchical attention network for capturing users' preferences adaptively. At the same time, we design a user intent-aware module based on disentangled representations to extract the user's intents. Finally, the user's preferences and their intents obtained by the user intent perception module are combined to recommend the POI for the user. Extensive evaluations are conducted on two real-world POI check-in datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed model IAGNN outperforms the baselines in terms of both recall and MRR.

AB As a key task of fine-grained sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to analyse people's opinions at the aspect level from user-generated texts. Various sub-tasks have been defined according to different scenarios, extracting aspect terms, opinion terms, and the corresponding sentiment. However, most existing studies merely focus on a specific sub-task or a subset of sub-tasks, having many complicated models designed and developed. This hinders the practical applications of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Therefore, some unified frameworks are proposed to handle all the subtasks, but most of them suffer from two limitations. First, the syntactic features are neglected, but such features have been proven effective for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Second, very few efficient mechanisms are developed to leverage important syntactic features, e.g., dependency relations, dependency relation types, and part-of-speech tags. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel unified framework to handle all defined sub-tasks for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Specifically, based on the graph convolutional network, a multi-layer semantic model is designed to capture the semantic relations between aspect and opinion terms. Moreover, a multi-layer syntax model is proposed to learn explicit dependency relations from different layers. To facilitate the sub-tasks, the learned semantic features are propagated to the syntax model with better semantic guidance to learn the syntactic representations comprehensively. Different from the conventional syntactic model, the proposed framework introduces two attention mechanisms. One is to model dependency relation and type, and the other is to encode part-of-speech tags for detecting aspect and opinion term boundaries. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed novel unified framework, and the experimental results on four groups of real-world datasets explicitly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over a range of baselines.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Anomaly detection of multivariate time series data has drawn extensive research attention recently, as it can be widely applied into various different domains, such as Prognostics Health Management, community behaviour monitoring, financial Anti-fraud and so on. Anomalies typically refer to unexpected observations or sequences within the captured data. The prevailing solutions of current anomaly detection methods are not only highly related to the individual use, but also rely on the domain-specific prior knowledge. Existing methods of anomaly detection by detecting aberrations encounter fundamental engineering challenges in terms of steam data online nature and the lack of expert knowledge for the training data set. Also, to meet the practical requirements, the anomaly detection model is often required to be used in edge architectures where the computing resources are limited, which leads to the demand for developing light-weight anomaly detection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, unsupervised anomaly detection scheme, called LUAD. LUAD is consists of a detection model and a diagnosis model. The detection model learns the normal patterns of input data via an encoder-decoder scheme that combines Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to deconstruct and reconstruct multivariate time series data. The diagnosis model improves LUAD's overall detection accuracy and provides a reasonable explanation for an anomaly. Experiments on three very different public datasets indicate that LUAD is both highly generalizable and more accurate than the two current state-of-the-arts. Overall, the LUAD model outperforms the baselines both in effectiveness (0.71%& SIM;1.45% higher) and efficiency (31X smaller in model size, 1.9X faster in training time).

DE Fractional-order multi-agent systems; Dynamic event-triggered mechanism;

AB This paper examines the concept of the leader-follower formation for fractional-order multi-agent systems (FO-MASs) by utilizing dynamic event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) method. Firstly, a dynamic event triggered mechanism (DETM) is designed relying on the combined measurement vector, in which an auxiliary variable is introduced to dynamically adjust the threshold for each fractional-order agent system. Unlike most existing event-triggered communication mechanisms, whose threshold parameters are always fixed, the threshold parameters in our designed event-triggered conditions can be dynamically adjusted according to the fractional-order dynamic rule. Numerical results show that the proposed DETM can achieve a better system performance in reducing the sampling frequency and the expected formation performance. Secondly, the leader-follower formation control problem is transformed into checking the asymptotic stability problem of the closed-loop system. In addition, due to the memorability of fractional calculus operators, a distinctive condition is established to avoid the occurrence of Zeno behaviors reported in existing dynamic event-triggered schemes. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the dynamic event-triggered SMC method proposed in this paper.

ID INTEGRATION
AB Multi-view Semi-supervised Learning (MSL) is effective in using limited labels and considerable label-free data to improve learning performance. It has been successfully applied to a lot of real scenarios. In this study, we propose a model, termed MSL with Adaptive Graph Fusion (MSLAGF), which provides a novel solution for MSL. Unlike most existing methods propagating label information through the linear combination of pre-built fixed view-based similarity graphs, MSLAGF merges view-based graph construction, graph fusion, and label propagation. It adaptively learns view-specific graphs and automatically assigns weight coefficients to them. A multi-view fusion optimal graph is cleverly learned depending not only on the raw feature space but also on the dynamically predicted label space. Moreover, we present an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the formulated model. The view-specific graphs, the weight coefficients, the optimal graph, and the predicted labels are mutually negotiated and optimized in the optimization procedure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets validate the superiority.

TI BMDF-SR: bidirectional multi-sequence decoupling fusion method for
   sequential recommendation
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Sequence recommendation; Bidirectional dependency; Multi-sequence model;
   Contextual information; Attention decoupling fusion
AB In the domain of sequence recommendation, contextual information has been shown to effectively improve the accuracy of predicting the user's next interaction. However, existing studies do not consider the dependencies between contextual information and item sequences, but the contextual information is directly fusing with the item sequences, which brings the problems described below: (1) Direct fusion fuses contextual information (e.g., time and categories) with item sequences which increases the dimensionality of the embedding matrix, thus increasing the complexity of the attention computation. (2) The attention computation of heterogeneous context information in the same embedding matrix makes it difficult for the recommendation model to distinguish this heterogeneous information. Therefore, we propose a bidirectional multi-sequence decoupling fusion method for sequence recommendation (BMDF-SR) to address the above issues. To establish the dependencies between temporal context sequences and item sequences, we first treat temporal contextual information as independent sequences and build bidirectional dependencies between contextual information sequences and item sequences via a three-layer seq2seq structure. Then, we perform attention computation independently for context sequences such as categories, and the complexity of attention computation can be effectively reduced by this decoupled attention computation. Moreover, since the attention computation is performed separately for each sequence, the interference between heterogeneous information during sequence fusion is reduced, allowing the model to effectively discriminate between different types of information. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the BMDF-SR method outperforms popular models.

AB Untethered magnetic millirobots with a characteristic length of a few millimeters can be wirelessly controlled. They exhibit promising potential in a wide variety of applications, particularly for tasks in clinic workspaces. However, magnetically controlling these robots is counter-intuitive and requires a steep learning curve, hindering their wide adoption. Herein, a computer-aided teleoperation platform is developed to operate a soft millirobot, with its feedback control being conducted behind-the-scenes, bridging the user's inputs directly with the millirobot's actions to offer an intuitive control. This system enables untrained users to conveniently control the position and actions of the millirobot inside a human stomach phantom by pointing-and-clicking on a real-time video monitor or using a keyboard. The platform automatically materializes the user's instructions by maneuvering a robotic arm with a tip-mounted magnet to exert a magnetic field to induce the desired response from the millirobot. Experiments show that the system allows the user to intuitively operate the millirobot and deliver its cargo without splitting their attention to monitor the workspace or to calculate the constantly changing control parameters. This platform can lower the barrier for healthcare practitioners without engineering expertise to adopt miniature robotic systems into their workflow and realize these systems' promising potential.
   This project develops a teleoperation system that allows nonexpert users to intuitively control a magnetic millirobot within a stomach phantom. The direct linkage between the user's inputs and the robot's actions lowers the barrier of operating such robotic systems, alleviates the burden on healthcare practitioners, and thereby enhances the safety and efficiency of their utilization in medical applications.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Pressure ulcers, which can result from prolonged sitting, pose a significant challenge for wheelchair users. Soft robotics has considerable potential in preventing pressure ulcers. However, current soft robotics, constructed from flexible materials, face limitations including insufficient proprioception and controllability. Herein, a vacuum-powered proprioceptive soft-rigid hybrid actuator (PSHA) module and a modular pressure redistribution cushion (MPRC) developed using this module are introduced. This PSHA module is capable of detecting both position and force. Each module within the MPRC is equipped with onboard control, proprioceptive sensation, and inter-module communication. The MPRC incorporates a closed-loop control system, enabling it to actively redistribute pressure, thereby preventing prolonged compression of local soft tissue during periods of inactivity. The proposed PSHA module, as evidenced in its application in pressure redistribution cushions, offers a promising approach for designs intent on reducing the risk of pressure ulcers. This study significantly contributes to the advancement of assistive technology, with the potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with immobility or limited mobility.
   Herein, a modular pressure redistribution cushion is built based on soft-rigid hybrid actuator modules. The module possesses the capability to sense and control both position and force. The cushion can accurately pinpoint the areas of maximum interface pressure, and subsequently redistribute pressure accordingly. This redistribution mechanism serves to avert the prolonged compression of localized soft tissues.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB ML applications proliferate across various sectors. Large internet firms employ ML to train intelligent models using vast datasets, including sensitive user information. However, new regulations like GDPR require data removal by businesses. Deleting data from ML models is more complex than databases. Machine Un-learning (MUL), an emerging field, garners academic interest for selectively erasing learned data from ML models. MUL benefits multiple disciplines, enhancing privacy, security, usability, and accuracy. This article reviews MUL's significance, providing a taxonomy and summarizing key MUL algorithms. We categorize modern MUL models by criteria, including model independence, data driven, and implementation considerations. We explore MUL applications in smart devices and recommendation systems. We also identify open questions and future research areas. This work advances methods for implementing regulations like GDPR and safeguarding user privacy.

AB Orthoptera are insects with excellent olfactory sense abilities due to their antennae richly equipped with receptors. This makes them interesting model organisms to be used as biosensors for environmental and agricultural monitoring. Herein, we investigated if the house cricket Acheta domesticus can be used to detect different chemical cues by examining the movements of their antennae and attempting to identify specific antennal displays associated to different chemical cues exposed (e.g., sucrose or ammonia powder). A neural network based on state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., SLEAP) for pose estimation was built to identify the proximal and distal ends of the antennae. The network was optimised via grid search, resulting in a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.74%. To classify the stimulus type, another network was employed to take in a series of keypoint sequences, and output the stimulus classification. To find the best one-dimensional convolutional and recurrent neural networks, a genetic algorithm-based optimisation method was used. These networks were validated with iterated K-fold validation, obtaining an average accuracy of 45.33% for the former and 44% for the latter. Notably, we published and introduced the first dataset on cricket recordings that relate this animal's behaviour to chemical stimuli. Overall, this study proposes a novel and simple automated method that can be extended to other animals for the creation of Biohybrid Intelligent Sensing Systems (e.g., automated video-analysis of an organism's behaviour) to be exploited in various ecological scenarios.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article; Early Access
DE convolutional neural nets; image segmentation; remote sensing
AB Salient object detection (SOD), one of the most important applications in the field of computer vision, aims to extract the most visually appealing regions of scenes. However, the improvement of the accuracy of existing salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) is usually accompanied by an increase of network complexity, which affects the application of these models. Motivated by this, a novel lightweight edge-supervised neural network for ORSI-SOD is proposed, named CSFFNet. Specifically, the backbone (ResNet34) is first lightened by feature encoding module (FEM), building a lightweight subnet for feature extraction. Then, in the transformer-based feature pyramid enhancement module (FPEM), the convolutional features obtained in the FEM are enhanced by long-distance dependence to obtain multi-scale features containing rich saliency cues. Based on this, the feature fusion module (FFM) is designed to capture cross-scale long-range dependencies and effectively fuse high-level semantic information with low-level detail information. Thus, the increase in network complexity due to multi-level decoding is avoided. Finally, the segmentation results are optimized by using salient edges as auxiliary information, which effectively improves the contrast and completeness of the results. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the lightweight CSFFNet achieves competitive or even better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
   The proposed CSFFNet feeds the local feature representation of the CNN-based encoder into a feature pyramid module based on transformer to obtain global attention features. Meanwhile, we built a feature enhancement module to fuse features at different levels in a more refined way to achieve high-accuracy ORSI-SOD.image

AB Fuzzy reasoning gathered significant attention for its extensive utility since it was introduced. This work puts emphasis on its theoretical aspects and presents a framework for fuzzy logic reasoning considering time-varying uncertainty based on robust control theory. The proposed framework is built upon one basic setting, the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning, which provides a criterion to demonstrate the validness of a chain reasoning by analytically quantifying its truth value based on multiple fuzzy implication models. The fuzzy reasoning system is casted to a dynamic system where the reasoning process is proactively controlled without violating the basic setting. The time-varying uncertainty in system variables or parameters is addressed by involving the delicately designed robust control. Furthermore, the diverse ways in which time-varying uncertainty impacts the system are also discussed, from modeling stage to control stage. Finally, an automated speed control problem with time-varying uncertainty is considered to demonstrate how to apply the proposed framework.

AB Probability hesitation fuzzy sets(PHFSs) have been paid increasing attention in the fuzzy domain nowadays, and correlation coefficient is becoming an important research content in fuzzy data analysis, many scholars have been conducted relevant researches on it. However, the existing correlation coefficients between PHFSs have some limitations, such as not considering the number of membership degrees and having counter-intuitive phenomenon to some extent. Therefore, we propose the mixed correlation coefficient between PHFSs. To begin with, we give the concepts of the average, variance, and length ratio of PHFE to illustrate the integrity, distribution, and length. Then, we define the average, variance, and length three correlation coefficients respectively on the above basic concepts. Furthermore, we construct the mixed correlation coefficient through combining these basic correlation coefficients, and extend to weighted form in addition, which addresses the issues of the available correlation coefficients. Finally, we utilize proposed correlation coefficient to analysis problems of data association and decision making. The effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method is illustrated at length.

AB Humans and animals have the ability to continuously learn new information over their lifetime without losing previously acquired knowledge. However, artificial neural networks struggle with this due to new information conflicting with old knowledge, resulting in catastrophic forgetting. The complementary learning systems (CLS) theory (McClelland and McNaughton, 1995; Kumaran et al. 2016) suggests that the interplay between hippocampus and neocortex systems enables long-term and efficient learning in the mammalian brain, with memory replay facilitating the interaction between these two systems to reduce forgetting. The proposed Lifelong Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation (LLEDA) framework draws inspiration from the CLS theory and mimics the interaction between two networks: a DA network inspired by the hippocampus that quickly adjusts to changes in data distribution and an SSL network inspired by the neocortex that gradually learns domain-agnostic general representations. LLEDA's latent replay technique facilitates communication between these two networks by reactivating and replaying the past memory latent representations to stabilize long-term generalization and retention without interfering with the previously learned information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other methods resulting in a long-term adaptation while being less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains.

AB The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased considerably in the past few years, which resulted in an exponential growth of cyber attacks on IoT infrastructure. As a consequence, the prompt detection of attacks in IoT environments through the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has become essential. This article proposes a novel approach to intrusion detection in IoT based on a stacking ensemble of deep learning (DL) models. This approach is named Deep Integrated Stacking for the IoT (DIS-IoT) and it combines four different DL models into a fully connected DL layer, creating a standalone ensemble model. DIS-IoT is evaluated on three open-source datasets, namely ToN_IoT, CICIDS2017 and SWaT, in binary and multi-class classification and compared results with other standard DL methods. Experiments demonstrate that DIS-IoT is capable of a high-level accuracy with a very low False Positive rate (FPR) in all datasets. Results were also compared against other state-of-the-art works available in the literature, which used similar methods on the same ToN_IoT dataset. DIS-IoT achieves comparable performance with others in binary classification and outperforms them in multi-class classification. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep clustering plays an important role in data analysis, and with the prevalence of graph data nowadays, various deep clustering models on graph are constantly proposed. However, due to the lack of more adequate clustering guidance, the discriminability of feature representation learned from these models for the clustering task is limited. Therefore, for the purpose of enabling the output of these models to be more cluster-oriented, we propose a Deep Clustering Optimization Method for Graph Neural Networks (DCOM-GNN), which can be attached to the original model architecture conveniently. For DCOM-GNN, it contains two components, one is the inter-cluster distance optimization module, whose role is to further adjust the distance between clusters of the original model output rationally. Another one is the intra-cluster distance optimization module, which aims to improve the cohesiveness of the original model output. Comprehensive experiments show that the performance of various deep clustering models on graph can be significantly improved after adding DCOM-GNN.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI BookKD: A novel knowledge distillation for reducing distillation costs

AB Knowledge distillation guides student networks' training and enhances their performance through excellent teacher networks. However, along with the performance advantages, knowledge distillation also entails a huge computational burden, sometimes tens or even hundreds of times that of traditional training methods. So, this paper designs a book-based knowledge distillation (BookKD) to minimize the costs of knowledge distillation while improving performance. First, a decoupling-based knowledge distillation framework is designed. By decoupling the traditional knowledge distillation process into two independent sub-processes, book-making and book-learning, knowledge distillation can be completed with little resource consumption. Second, a book-making method based on knowledge ensemble and knowledge regularization is developed, which makes books by organizing and processing the knowledge generated by teachers. These books can replace these teachers to provide sufficient knowledge with little distillation costs. Finally, a book-learning method based on entropy dynamic adjustment and label smoothing is designed. The entropy dynamic adjustment optimizes the training loss and mitigates student networks' difficulty in learning books. Label smoothing alleviates the student network's over-confidence in ground truth labels, which increases its attention to the class similarity knowledge in books. BookKD is tested on three image classification datasets, CIFAR100, ImageNet and ImageNet100, and an object detection dataset PASCAL VOC 2007. The experiment results indicate the advantages of BookKD in reducing distillation costs and improving distillation performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Deep hashing; Image retrieval; Transformer; Self-attention
ID FEATURES
AB Transformer based on self-attention mechanism has made remarkable achievements in natural language processing, which inspired the application research of Transformer in computer vision. The current deep hashing algorithms extract image features through the convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN concentrates on local information, and features lack global dependency information, which has an impact on image retrieval accuracy. To remedy the above defects, this paper proposes deep internally connected Transformer hashing for image retrieval (DICTH). DICTH has designed an improved Transformer block: internally connected Transformer block (ICT). ICT performs an embedded transformation on the feature maps, splices the generated Keys and Queries, to explore the rich context information between Query-Key pairs, and then dynamically encodes through multi-layer convolution to learn the context multi-head self-attention matrix. By combining ICT and ResNet18 to achieve selfattention injection, a long-distance dependency is established in the feature space to make up for the shortcomings of pure CNN in the feature extraction process and guide the algorithm to learn more accurate hash codes. At the same time, in the face of complex label information in big data sets, this paper uses an improved cross-entropy loss function: T-cross-entropy loss, to promote network learning of hash codes with more ability to distinguish between classes. In this paper, a lot of experiments have been conducted on CIFAR10, NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets to verify the performance of DICTH. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Boolean matrix factorization for symmetric binary variables

DT Article
DE Decomposition; Boolean data; Symmetric attribute; Formal concept
AB Binary variables classify into two types: asymmetric variables, where one state (1 or 0) is significantly more valuable than the other, and symmetric variables, where both states are equally valuable. Boolean matrix factorization (BMF), a popular methodology of preprocessing and analyzing tabular binary data, handles its input as asymmetric variables. In the paper, we develop an alternative that handles Boolean matrices as symmetric variables. Our method differs from traditional BMF in that the factors are linearly ordered by priority, and factors can contradict each other, meaning that one factor can assign a value of 1 while the other assigns a value of 0. In such a case, the factor with higher priority is the relevant one. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach provides a more compact data description than a straightforward application of the traditional BMF methods. Moreover, it is even able to overcome the Schein rank. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most of existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods do not fully exploit global and local similarity information from data. In this paper, we propose a novel local similarity learning approach in the convex NMF framework, which encourages inter-class separability that is desired for clustering. Thus, the new model is capable of enhancing intra-class similarity and inter-class separability with simultaneous global and local learning. Moreover, the model learns the factor matrices in an augmented kernel space, which is a convex combination of pre-defined kernels with auto-learned weights. Thus, the learnings of cluster structure, representation factor matrix, and the optimal kernel mutually enhance each other in a seamlessly integrated model, which leads to informative representation. Multiplicative updating rules are developed with theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although many missing data imputation methods have been proposed in the relevant literature, they focus on either time series or tabular data, but not on both. Hence, a generic sparse regression method for missing data imputation is proposed. The imputed values of a target feature are generated by solving a sparse least squares problem using a preconditioned iterative method based on generic approximate sparse pseudoinverse. Sparsity is introduced by dummy encoding existing or constructed (through discretization) categorical features. Extensive experiments were conducted on several datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for both time series and tabular data.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel optimization algorithm called the optical microscope algorithm (OMA) is developed and applied in this study. Drawing inspiration from the magnification capabilities of an optical microscope on the target object, OMA uses the naked eye for initial observation and simulates the magnification process through an objective lens and an eyepiece. The performance of OMA, which is user friendly and does not require predefined operating parameters, is validated through two experiments: (1) OMA is compared to nine well-known metaheuristic algorithms using constraint handling with 50 benchmark functions involving multiple dimensions. The results indicate that OMA consistently outperforms all other algorithms and requires a short computational time. (2) OMA is applied to solve engineering problems, including structural optimization and multiple resources leveling in the multiple projects scheduling (MRLMP). In those cases, OMA not only demonstrates superiority but also requires the fewest evaluations of objective functions. The novel OMA, which is robust, easy to implement, and uses fewer control parameters, can be deployed to solve for various numerical optimization problems. The source code of OMA is publicly accessible at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/ 134541-optical-microscope-algorithm-oma. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fine-tuning a large multi-lingual pretrained language model demonstrates impressive results in crosslanguage understanding. However, it still suffers when the training and test data have different distributions owing to various languages and domains. On one hand, annotating target data for different languages or domains is time-consuming or infeasible. On the other hand, fine-tuning a large language model often incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient and effective adaptation framework for cross-language sentiment analysis based on a fixed pretrained multi-lingual model. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Adaptation (DFA) module to fully leverage the features from different layers of the pretrained model such that its large backbone is not involved during adaptation training. Furthermore, we observe that traditional adversarial domain adaptation training could compromise the discriminative information of the model by pushing source and target features towards each other. The source features obtained with supervised training preserved the discriminability of the model, which should be less affected. Therefore, we propose a novel Biased Adversarial Training (BAT) method, that encourages only the target features towards source features. Extensive experimental results on various cross-lingual and cross-lingual-and-domain sentiment analysis tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Additionally, several ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of each proposed module. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evaluating human dialogue is a complex task, as our conversation are never structured. There are, however, cases where there is some structure in our conversation, e.g., in a typical call centre, dialogue between a call centre agent and customer revolves around certain topics of conversation. These dialogues can be evaluated based on some pre-specified criteria as well as sub-criteria. This evaluation is typically done manually, which can be time-consuming, motivating the need for an automated system that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to evaluate dialogues efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed a novel dialogue-evaluation framework that leverages recent advancements in deep learning research. The contributions of this work are two fold. Firstly, we introduce a straightforward end-to-end framework - CallAI, for evaluating dialogues in any domain, based on some predefined hierarchical criteria. Secondly, we present a novel algorithm - TAABLM, utilizing a novel combination of aspect-based learning along with traditional TF-IDF features for text. We show in this paper, that TAABLM outperforms conventional baselines such as BERT, LSTM, etc, delivering improved performance in automated dialogue evaluation, whereas CallAI offers a simple yet elegant framework for an AI-based solution to hierarchical dialogue evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework and proposed algorithm on three datasets, where we quantify performance in terms of an aggregated dialogue-score as well as in terms of either accuracy or AuROC metrics.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Multi-label data classification has received much attention due to its wide range of application domains. Unfortunately, a class imbalance problem often occurs in multi-label datasets, causing challenges for classification algorithms. Oversampling is one of the most important approaches, as it generates minority label instances to balance the class distribution. However, existing oversampling methods ignore existing label correlations, resulting in the generation of inappropriate synthetic minority samples and making multi-label data classification tasks harder. In this work, we propose an oversampling method that considers label correlations and identifies two critical boundary regions for generating synthetic minority samples. Moreover, we propose a weighting strategy to assign weights to these instances based on their distance information. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on sixteen public datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of various assessment metrics, such as Macro F1 and Macro AUC.

DE Task-oriented dialogue system; Natural response generation; Dialogue
   summarization; Pre-trained language model
AB With the development of pre-trained language models (PrLM), the research of PrLM-based multi domain task-oriented dialogue systems (TOD) has attracted growing attention and has achieved great progress. However, most current studies suffer from two problems. First, they model dialogue state tracking as an independent subtask supervised by slot-value pairs, resulting in poor adaptability when transferring to new task domains. Second, these studies ignore the fact that not all dialogue histories are valuable for the ensuing turns as they increase in length. To tackle these two issues, we propose a simple and novel framework to explore multi-domain TOD by jointly training response generation and dialogue summarization with PrLM as the backbone. Specifically, first, we use fluent text generated by the dialogue summarization model to replace formatted dialogue states, treating the dialogue state identification task as a natural language generation task, which allows dialogue state tracking to be easily extended to new task domains. Second, dialogue summarization removes redundant and useless information from the current dialogue process and is fed into the response decoder enabling the system to focus on crucial details in long dialogues. Furthermore, we employ a dialogue chunk detector to assist the dialogue summarization model and design a fusion mechanism to dynamically integrate helpful dialogue summarization into the response generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations on two public datasets and demonstrate that the joint framework can benefit both tasks from each other.

DE Cross-modal fusion; 3D object detection; Autonomous driving
AB As two major data modalities in autonomous driving, LiDAR point clouds and RGB images include rich geometric clues and semantic features. Compared with using a single data modality, fusing two data modalities can provide complementary information for the 3D object detection task. However, some prevalent cross-modal methods (Vora et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Sindagi et al., 2019) cannot effectively obtain favorable information, and only adopt a unilateral fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion strategy named Bilateral Content Awareness Fusion (BCAF) to address these issues. Specifically, BCAF adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a LiDAR Content Awareness (LCA) branch and an Image Content Awareness (ICA) branch along with a Soft Fusion (SF) module. First, the LCA and ICA are used to enhance instance-relevant clues. Then, with two awareness features given by the LCA and ICA branches, the aggregation features can be generated to choose favorable image features and LiDAR features. Finally, the SF module fuses the bilateral favorable features and outputs the cross-modal feature. Experiments of our method are conducted on the KITTI dataset, including 3D object detection evaluation and bird's eye view evaluation. Compared with the previous art method, our approach achieves significant improvements. Especially for the metric of mean Average Precision (mAP) on the Car category, our approach obtains 0.5 and 0.62 gains for the tasks of 3D object detection and bird's eye view, respectively.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   weighting; Adaptive receptive field
AB Feature registration is a core problem in computer vision and machine learning techniques. In recent years, significant progress has been made in learning-based feature registration algorithms. However, such methods usually capture image-level features and strive to capture contour information, inadvertently neglecting the exploration of low-texture regions, while the complex model structure brings more parameters. Therefore, it remains a challenging task to effectively address low-texture feature registration under limited sample conditions. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust feature registration algorithm to achieve fast feature registration in the low-texture case. Specifically, we first construct a two-step learning framework and use a faster adaptive heterogeneous filter (AdaH-Filter) to guide coarse-grained and fine-grained feature extraction. Then, we propose registration feature refiners (ReFR) to achieve the fusion of two-stage features in a low-texture environment while guaranteeing the speed of the detector. Finally, to further improve the network performance, a Warp Extractor is proposed to improve the speed and portability of model inference. This strategy allows the network to perform different levels of fine extraction adaptively according to the registration requirements. Moreover, the proposed method is trained in an end-to-end manner, guided by cosine loss, without any additional supervision. Extensive experimental results on several challenging and representative feature registration datasets in the industry show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, it has a faster inference speed under different sensor modalities.

In real life, there are often some data whose features will change with variables such as time, which is called ordered data with changing features. However, for ordered data with changing features, the existing methods in the current field are not applicable, because when the features of the data change, these methods basically need to recalculate from scratch to get a new reduction result, which is very time-consuming and does not use the previous reduction result. The feature incremental attribute reduction algorithm can be applied to the previous reduction results, thus greatly saving time. Drawing inspiration from this, this paper studies incremental attribute reduction algorithms under the order data with changing features. This paper first gives the entropy of the dominant condition of the dominant relation matrix and the updating principle of the new dominant relation matrix and the dominant diagonal matrix when the feature changes are explored. Later, two incremental attribute reduction algorithms HAR-A and HAR-D are also proposed in this paper, which are respectively applied to add features and delete features in ordered data with changing features. The subsequent experiments were also carried out on 9 data sets of UCI, and the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated. It can be seen from the experimental results that the two incremental attribute reduction algorithms we proposed are very effective.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Attackers attempt to bias the outputs of collaborative recommender systems by maliciously rating goods or services. To detect such attacks, many deep learning-based detection methods have been proposed and shown to be feasible. However, most methods require a large number of labeled user profiles for training to ensure good detection performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep semisupervised detection approach based on the improved Meta Pseudo Labels, named DSSD-ImMPL. DSSD-ImMPL can achieve high detection performance given a small number of labeled training samples and a certain number of unlabeled training samples. We first improve the Meta Pseudo Labels method by generating a group of student networks by an experienced teacher network instead of only one student network in the original Meta Pseudo Labels method to improve the classification performance. Then, we use the group of student networks to detect the recommendation attack. The detection performance is verified with classical, mixed, GSA-GANs, and real attacks on three benchmark datasets by comparing DSSD-ImMPL with the state-of-the-art detection methods.

AB Traditional deep learning fails to identify new faults when the number of faulty samples is limited. Existing meta-learning studies on cross-domain small-sample fault diagnosis do not fully account for the differences in the distribution of faults across domains between training data and new fault classes, which limits further performance improvement of the diagnosis model. In this study, we propose a new joint transfer fine-grained metric network for cross-domain few-shot fault diagnosis. First, a hybrid attention is used to enhance the feature extraction ability of the model and suppress redundant features. The proposed joint transfer function is used to align the corresponding subdomains of the source and target domains in small samples. Finally, cross-domain few-shot fault diagnostics is implemented using a modified fine-grained metric network. The proposed joint transfer fine-grained metric network outperformed other common meta-learning fault diagnosis methods on three mechanical device datasets. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Joint adaptive distribution; Duplex adversarial network; Partial domain
   adaptation; Rotating machinery; Fault diagnosis
AB Domain-adaptation technologies have been widely developed for mechanical fault diagnosis. Most related methods assume the same label space between the source and target domains, whereas the partial domain adaptation problem is more widespread and challenging. Moreover, most previous studies focused on data distribution alignment but failed to address fine-grained distributional differences of subdomains. Hence, this study proposes a novel duplex adversarial deep discriminative network (DADDN) for fault diagnosis in cross-domain partial transfer cases. First, a dual-domain adversarial attention mechanism is adopted in the DADDN to discriminate the label space and evaluate the transferability of the data samples. Second, a new metric function of the distribution difference is employed to learn both the fine-grained and discriminative features of the data samples and a weight-joint adaptive distribution mechanism is proposed to improve the domain confusion capability. Third, a center-of-balance weighting strategy is utilized to expand the categories of the target domain and reduce label space asymmetry. In addition, to avoid negative transfer, a weighting mechanism is designed to filter outlier categories, and a dynamic adaptive factor is introduced to weigh the importance of the marginal and conditional distributions. Finally, the effectiveness, robustness, and progressiveness of the proposed method are validated using several partial-transfer diagnostic tasks based on three rotating machinery datasets.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great success in graph processing. However, current message-passing-based GNNs have limitations in terms of feature aggregations and update mechanisms that rely on a fixed mode, resulting in inadequate representations of the neighborhood structure's richness. Furthermore, the convolution layer in most GNNs lacks flexibility and multiple channels compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which employ multiple channels, where different kernels capture shared patterns of images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel scalable graph convolution network (SGCN) to enhance structural information learning by introducing an expressive feature aggregation mechanism. Drawing inspiration from the design of CNNs, the SGCN includes graph-shaped kernels that perform multichannel convolutions on the subgraph structure. A sampler based on degree centrality is employed to simplify the computation costs, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the SGCN achieved state-of-the-art performances on graph datasets with various scales (with accuracy improvements of up to 5.38%).& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Concept drift has been a widely concerned problem in data analysis and many important achievements have been obtained. However, there are few discussions on concept drift detection in inconsistent information system that is very common in various application fields. In this paper, a concept drift detection algorithm based on the decision distribution (IDP-DD) is proposed. To begin, we present the notion of decision distribution function by means of inclusion degree and delineate the decision empirical vector. Subsequently, we expound upon decision empirical distance and analyze the limits characteristics of sampling; thirdly, we display the algorithm implementation process of IDP-DD. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of IDP-DD with a some commonly employed datasets and a real-word example dataset. Theory analysis and experiment verification indicate that the algorithm IDP-DD can not only quantify the severity of concept drift, but also visually present the region where concept drift occurs. At the same time, combined with sampling method, this algorithm does not need to traverse all samples at one time, so the complexity and calculation cost can be effectively reduced. So IDP-DD is more stable and can effectively facilitate data-driven decision problems.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern IoT ecosystems are the preferred target of threat actors wanting to incorporate resource-constrained devices within a botnet or leak sensitive information. A major research effort is then devoted to create countermeasures for mitigating attacks, for instance, hardware-level verification mechanisms or effective network intrusion detection frameworks. Unfortunately, advanced malware is often endowed with the ability of cloaking communications within network traffic, e.g., to orchestrate compromised IoT nodes or exfiltrate data without being noticed. Therefore, this paper showcases how different autoencoder-based architectures can spot the presence of malicious communications hidden in conversations, especially in the TTL of IPv4 traffic. To conduct tests, this work considers IoT traffic traces gathered in a real setting and the presence of an attacker deploying two hiding schemes (i.e., naive and "elusive" approaches). Collected results showcase the effectiveness of our method as well as the feasibility of deploying autoencoders in production-quality IoT settings.

AB The growth of Big Data has resulted in an overwhelming increase in the volume of data available, including the number of features. Feature selection, the process of selecting relevant features and discarding irrelevant ones, has been successfully used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets. However, with numerous feature selection approaches in the literature, determining the best strategy for a specific problem is not straightforward. In this study, we compare the performance of various feature selection approaches to a random selection to identify the most effective strategy for a given type of problem. We use a large number of datasets to cover a broad range of real-world challenges. We evaluate the performance of seven popular feature selection approaches and five classifiers. Our findings show that feature selection is a valuable tool in machine learning and that correlation-based feature selection is the most effective strategy regardless of the scenario. Additionally, we found that using improper thresholds with ranker approaches produces results as poor as randomly selecting a subset of features.

AB A new label-free imaging flow cytometry method for noninvasive and automated biological cell classification is presented. Each cell is rolled during flow, and its off-axis holograms from multiple viewpoints are acquired. Using the reconstructed quantitative phase profiles of the cell projections, highly discriminating features, enabling cell detection, classification, and differentiation, are extracted via a modified ResNet-18 deep convolutional neural network architecture. The model is first validated by classifying metastatic breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) and normal human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A). An increase in classification accuracy by 1% is achieved when processing five interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This model is further tested on four types of white blood cells and exhibits an accuracy increase of 5% when processing 12 interferometric projections versus processing a single interferometric projection. This approach is shown to be superior to that of using conventional 2D-rotation augmentation, and can be used to decrease substantially the number of cell examples needed for training the classification model without impairing the results. This novel concept has great potential to be incorporated into label-free imaging flow cytometry and improve cell classification, and be used to detect various types of medical conditions and diseases.
   A new deep learning approach for cell classification with multiheaded Resnet is presented. Each cell is acquired from multiple viewpoints while rotated and passing along the field of view of a label-free holographic microscope. This approach acts as experimentally acquired 3D-rolling augmentation and allows the network to learn the features associated with different viewing angles, increasing classification performance.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Exploring the potentials of online machine learning for predictive

AB This study addresses data-driven predictive maintenance, an area in which machine learning has received considerable attention. Traditionally, a machine learning model is trained on static data before being put into production to predict failures on incoming data. However, new data typically present novelties that were not included in the training data, such as unexpected anomalies or faults. Such novelties reduce the model accuracy and require model retraining, which we consider to be a suboptimal practice.Therefore, we propose to leverage online machine learning as an adaptive and continuous alternative to implement efficient predictive maintenance on systems that produce data continuously. The literature on predictive maintenance concentrates primarily on failure prediction, whereas there are multiple stages in a standard predictive maintenance framework, such as data preprocessing and diagnostics, that require attention. In this study, we propose a modular pipeline consisting of three modules to execute many stages inside a predictive maintenance solution. Each module represents one of our original contributions. Firstly, because a system generates repeating patterns in the form of cycles when performing its functions, we construct an online active learning-based framework to extract these cycles from a stream of sensor data (cycle extraction with InterCE). Secondly, we implement an autoencoder for encoding the extracted cycles into feature vectors (feature learning with LSTM-AE). Thirdly, we develop an adaptive scoring function to compute the health of any system at any time using online clustering on the stream of feature vectors (health detection with CheMoc). These three contributions establish our framework for processing raw sensor data for predictive maintenance. We evaluate our methods using a real-world data set provided by SNCF, the French national railway company. For each experiment, we simulate a data stream consisting of sequentially arriving data from the provided data set to test our online algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that (i) InterCE is able to extract cycles from a high-speed stream with greater accuracy than a hand-crafted expert system, (ii) LSTM-AE can identify meaningful features from the extracted cycles, and (iii) CheMoc can discover clusters that represent physical anomalies of the systems and capture the health evolution of the monitored systems. Due to a lack of ground-truth data at the time of writing, we have not implemented the prognostics method and will reserve this for future works. This study confirms the potential of online machine learning as an adaptive and lifelong learning solution for predictive maintenance.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
DE Conditional layer normalization; Entity mapping; Joint relational triple
   extraction; Potential relation detection
AB Joint relational triple extraction treats entity recognition and relation extraction as a joint task to extract relational triples, and this is a critical task in information extraction and knowledge graph construction. However, most existing joint models still fall short in terms of extracting overlapping triples. Moreover, these models ignore the trigger words of potential relations during the relation detection process. To address the two issues, a joint model based on Potential Relation Detection and Conditional Entity Mapping is proposed, named PRDCEM. Specifically, the proposed model consists of three components, i.e., potential relation detection, candidate entity tagging, and conditional entity mapping, corresponding to three subtasks. First, a non-autoregressive decoder that contains a cross-attention mechanism is applied to detect potential relations. In this way, different potential relations are associated with the corresponding trigger words in the given sentence, and the semantic representations of the trigger words are fully utilized to encode potential relations. Second, two distinct sequence taggers are employed to extract candidate subjects and objects. Third, an entity mapping module incorporating conditional layer normalization is designed to align the candidate subjects and objects. As such, each candidate subject and each potential relation are combined to form a condition that is incorporated into the sentence, which can effectively extract overlapping triples. Finally, the negative sampling strategy is employed in the entity mapping module to mitigate the error propagation from the previous two components. In a comparison with 15 baselines, the experimental results obtained on two widely used public datasets demonstrate that PRDCEM can effectively extract overlapping triples and achieve improved performance.

DT Article; Early Access
DE computer vision; image classification
AB A technique known as domain adaptation is utilised to address classification challenges in an unlabelled target domain by leveraging labelled source domains. Previous domain adaptation approaches have predominantly focussed on global domain adaptation, neglecting class-level information and resulting in suboptimal transfer performance. In recent years, a considerable number of researchers have explored class-level domain adaptation, aiming to precisely align the distribution of diverse domains. Nevertheless, existing research on class-level alignment tends to align domain features either on or in proximity to classification boundaries, which introduces ambiguous samples that can impact classification accuracy. In this study, the authors propose a novel strategy called class guided constraints (CGC) to tackle this issue. Specifically, CGC is employed to preserve the compactness within classes and separability between classes of domain features prior to class-level alignment. Furthermore, the authors incorporate CGC in conjunction with similarity guided constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms numerous state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods significantly and achieves greater improvements compared to the baseline approach.

AB Artificial intelligence is extensively utilized across various high-risk domains, and ensuring the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of these systems is of paramount importance. This necessitates adherence to several imperative requirements such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptability in order to establish the trustworthiness of these systems. The decision-making process of the systems relies heavily on data quality. However, existing studies in the field of industrial fault diagnosis have not fully considered the influence of noise interference on the system accuracy and the interpretability of the algorithm. Therefore, this study aims to investigate reliable and robust diagnostic techniques along with black-box model interpretation when confronted with noise interference in practical applications for industrial fault diagnosis. To solve the above problems, an explicable temporal feature network (ETFN) based on deep Shapley additive explanation (Deep SHAP) values is proposed, which increases the robustness and interpretability of the model. First, adaptive features extracted from the improved deep residual shrinkage network are combined with empirical features to increase the robustness of the model. Then, the combined features are used as input to the ETFN model for rotating device diagnosis. Deep SHAP is used to rank all the combined feature contributions and further interpret the model diagnosis by adjusting the number of features. The proposed ETFN achieves a good balance between stability, accuracy, and interpretation on three real-world datasets. Leading accuracy is achieved on all three datasets. In particular, a diagnostic accuracy of more than 97% can still be maintained when perturbed by noise, which is not achieved by alternative methods. The interoperability of the proposed method in industrial diagnostic applications is also enhanced by Deep SHAP. We implemented ETFN for extremely robust diagnosis and human-computer interaction in real noise for industrial data.

AB Recent years, the development of DeepFake has raise a lot of security problems. Therefore, detection of DeepFake is critical. However, the existing DeepFake detection methods are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. adding carefully crafted imperceptible perturbations into forged images is possible to evade detection. In this paper, a DeepFake detection method based on image denoising is proposed by combining variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN), namely D-VAEGAN. Firstly, an encoder is designed to extract the features of the image in a low-dimensional latent space. Then, a decoder reconstructs the original clean image using the features in this low-dimensional latent space. Secondly, an auxiliary discriminative network is introduced to further improve the performance of the model, which improves the quality of the reconstructed images. Furthermore, feature similarity loss is added as a penalty term to the reconstruction optimization function to improve the adversarial robustness. Experimental results on the FaceForensics++ dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the five adversarial training-based defence methods. The approach achieves 96% in accuracy, which is on average about 50% higher than other comparison methods.

AB This paper aims to solve two challenging problems in fuzzy control: the complexity explosion caused by iterative derivation of the virtual control laws in design process and the fuzzy adaptive feedback stability for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. Firstly, the difficulty in backstepping control design for high-order nonlinear systems is solved by combining adding a power integrator method with the dynamic surface control technique and using the fuzzy logic system to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. Then, the non-affine fault of system states and control output can be transformed into a nonlinear one with unknown parameters. The proposed control strategy not only drives the tracking error to converge to an adjustable region of the origin within a fixed time, but also maintains the stability of the closed-loop systems. An advantage is that the convergence time does not depend on the initial state. Finally, the stabilization of a manipulator system is investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme.

AB Aggregating various decision information provided by a group of decision makers (DMs) into an integrated one is essential for seeking the optimal solution. This paper aims to propose an effective method for information aggregation in group decision-making (GDM) in an uncertain environment. The approach introduces a family of incentive-induced cluster-based uncertain ordered weighted averaging (II-CUOWA) operators from the perspective of incentive management. Specifically, the II-CUOWA operator is first introduced, involving the definition, the clustering method of judgment information, the calculation method of position weights, and several mathematical properties. Then, the study delves into the exploration of generalized formulas for the II-CUOWA operator, as well as discussing special cases achievable by adjusting internal parameters. Finally, this paper outlines the aggregation process of II-CUOWA operators when addressing GDM problems, accompanied by a practical example illustrating its application and validity in employees' performance assessment. The results show that II-CUOWA operators not only highlight the distributed structure of decision information but also possess the capability to reward or penalize alternatives, thereby guiding their development by considering the manager's incentive preference. The proposed method enriches the methodology of GDM theory from a novel research perspective and provides a solution to practical GDM problems.

AB Today, the development of urbanization and increasing the number of vehicles has resulted in displeased consequences like traffic congestion and vehicle queuing. The vast majority of countries in the world encounter the challenge of the explosive rise in traffic demand. In this regard, it is necessary to meet traffic demand in transport networks, especially in metropolitans. In traffic management and shortening the trip duration, traffic lights on the signalized intersections play an essential role in urban pathways. This work provides a multi-criteria decision-making method for optimum traffic light control in an isolated corner. The main idea involves establishing a set of sub-optimal solutions for traffic light timing and selecting the best one among the diverse solutions. We have mathematically modelled the problem as an optimization problem to achieve an optimal solution with less waiting time for vehicles in intersections and the lowest cost. Genetic algorithm (GA) and Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) are utilized for each phase to create a set of suitable timing scenarios. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to identify the best scenario, considering both waiting vehicles and traffic capacity as decision criteria. Its efficiency has been demonstrated over three different traffic volumes. Also, in a real-world implementation, its practical capability has been approved at a crossroads in Mashhad, Iran. The simulations indicate the improvement in the number of vehicles waiting behind the crossroad and the traffic capacity by 10% and 6.76% compared to the existing signal timing of the studied intersection, respectively.

AB Families of new, multi-level integer 2D arrays are introduced here as an extension of the well-known binary Legendre sequences that are derived from quadratic residues. We present a construction, based on Fourier and Finite Radon Transforms, for families of periodic perfect arrays, each of size p x p for many prime values p. Previously delta functions were used as the discrete projections which, when back-projected, build 2D perfect arrays. Here we employ perfect sequences as the discrete projected views. The base family size is p + 1. All members of these multi-level array families have perfect autocorrelation and constant, minimal cross-correlation. Proofs are given for four useful and general properties of these new arrays. 1) They are comprised of odd integers, with values between at most - p and + p, with a zero value at just one location. 2) They have the property of 'conjugate' spatial symmetry, where the value at location (i, j) is always the negative of the value at location (p - i, p - j). 3) Any change in the value assigned to the array's origin leaves all of its off-peak autocorrelation values unchanged. 4) A family of p+ 1, px p arrays can be compressed to size (p + 1)2 and each family member can be exactly and rapidly unpacked in a single p x p decompression pass.

AB In 3D vision, point cloud registration remains a major challenge, especially in end-to-end deep learning, where low-quality point pairs will directly lead to the degradation of registration accuracy. Therefore, we propose a point cloud registration network based on convolution fusion and a new attention mechanism to obtain high-quality point pairs and improve the accuracy of registration. In this work, we first fuse kernel point convolution and adaptive point convolution by cross-attention mechanism as the feature extraction backbone of the network to obtain features. Secondly, we use transformer to exchange information between source and target point clouds, which consists of a new attention mechanism module, named ReSE-Attention. It obtains a global feature view by adding a squeeze extraction module and deep learnable parameters to the normal attention mechanism. And then, a regression decoder is adapted to generate the correct point pairs. Finally, we first introduce Focal Loss on the loss function in point cloud registration to balance the relationship between overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Our approach is evaluated on both the scene dataset 3DMatch and the object dataset ModelNet and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB The online recommendation system has benefited the traditional restaurant business economically. However, finding the best restaurant during rush time and visiting new places is tough. This objective is addressed through a restaurant recommendation approach, which impacts the human decision-making method. With the help of collaborative filtering, some user-based recommendation systems were designed to generate the best recommendation based on user choices. Thus, a user preferences-based method is presented using A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and Simple Recurrent Unit to suggest restaurants based on user preferences. Here, a publicly available dataset from Kaggle called Kzomato is used with 9552 samples and 21 features. And the system obtained an F1-score, precision, and recall of 86%, which will save time and provide the best recommendation based on user preferences easily.

AB The bridge bottom crack detection provides important state information for bridge disease control and safety assessment. This paper proposes a detection method based on deep learning Faster R-CNN and BIM (Building Information Modeling). The UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) was used for close aerial photography to obtain high-resolution crack images of the concrete surface at the bottom of a bridge. Through deep learning algorithms, a Faster R-CNN model is trained and established for crack identifications. The crack identification accuracy rate and recall rate reach 92.03% and 96.54%, respectively. Crack images are mapped to a BIM model developed for the chosen bridge, and the box girder family with cracks and the three crack families of transverse cracks, longitudinal cracks and turtle cracks are established. The cracks are located and the visualization of the beam bridge with cracks was completed. In order to better assess the health condition of the bridge. The results show that the combination of UAV bridge crack detection and modelling solves the remote, visual and automated detection of cracks on the surface of bridge structures, which are difficult to reach manually, and has important scientific research and engineering application value.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Explaining the decisions made by population-based metaheuristics can often be considered difficult due to the stochastic nature of the mechanisms employed by these optimisation methods. As industries continue to adopt these methods in areas that increasingly require end-user input and confirmation, the need to explain the internal decisions being made has grown. In this article, we present our approach to the extraction of explanation supporting features using trajectory mining. This is achieved through the application of principal components analysis techniques to identify new methods of tracking population diversity changes post-runtime. The algorithm search trajectories were generated by solving a set of benchmark problems with a genetic algorithm and a univariate estimation of distribution algorithm and retaining all visited candidate solutions which were then projected to a lower dimensional sub-space. We also varied the selection pressure placed on high fitness solutions by altering the selection operators. Our results show that metrics derived from the projected sub-space algorithm search trajectories are capable of capturing key learning steps and how solution variable patterns that explain the fitness function may be captured in the principal component coefficients. A comparative study of variable importance rankings derived from a surrogate model built on the same dataset was also performed. The results show that both approaches are capable of identifying key features regarding variable interactions and their influence on fitness in a complimentary fashion.
