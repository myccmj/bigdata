AB The class of recurrent mixture density networks is an important class of probabilistic models used extensively in sequence modeling and sequence-to-sequence mapping applications. In this class of models, the density of a target sequence in each time-step is modeled by a Gaussian mixture model with the parameters given by a recurrent neural network. In this paper, we generalize recurrent mixture density networks by using a normalizing flow to non-linearly transform the target space. Furthermore to improve the modeling power, we adopting a suitable covariance matrix decomposition involving a summation of a low-rank and a diagonal matrix. Using these two techniques, we still have a tractable log-likelihood. We also applied the proposed model on some speech and image data, and observed that the model has significant modeling power outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the log-likelihood on some data. The log-likelihood improvement over other methods is 3523 units for TIMIT speech dataset, and is 1118 and 176 units for MNIST and CIFAR10 image datasets. We were only underperformed on one of the speech datasets by 1209 units.

AB Accidents caused by operators failing to wear safety gloves are a frequent problem at electric power operation sites, and the inefficiency of manual supervision and the lack of effective supervision methods result in frequent electricity safety accidents. To address the issue of low accuracy in glove detection with small-scale glove datasets. This article proposes a real-time glove detection algorithm using video surveillance to address these issues. The approach employs transfer learning and an attention mechanism to enhance detection average precision. The key ideas of our algorithm are as follows: (1) introducing the Combine Attention Partial Network (CAPN) based on convolutional neural networks, which can accurately recognize whether gloves are being worn, (2) combining channel attention and spatial attention modules to improve CAPN's ability to extract deeper feature information and recognition accuracy, and (3) using transfer learning to transfer human hand features in different states to gloves to enhance the small sample dataset of gloves. Experimental results show that the proposed network structure achieves high performance in terms of detection average precision. The average precision of glove detection reached 96.59%, demonstrating the efficacy of CAPN.

AB Clothing analysis has garnered significant attention, and within this field, clothing classification plays a vital role as one of the fundamental technologies. Due to the inherent complexity of clothing scenes in real-world environments, the learning of clothing features in such complex scenes often encounters interference. Because clothing classification relies on the contour and texture information of clothing, clothing classification in real scenes may lead to poor classification results. Therefore, this paper proposes a clothing classification network based on frequency-spatial domain conversion. The proposed network combines frequency domain information with spatial information and does not compress channels. It aims to enhance the extraction of clothing features and improve the accuracy of clothing classification. In our work, (1) we combine the frequency domain information and spatial information to establish a clothing feature extraction clothing classification network without compressed feature map channels, (2) we use the frequency domain feature enhancement module to realize the preliminary extraction of clothing features, and (3) we introduce a clothing dataset in complex scenes (Clothing-8). Our network achieves a top-1 model accuracy of 93.4% on the Clothing-8 dataset and 94.62% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Additionally, it also achieves the best results in terms of top-3 and top-5 metrics on the DeepFashion dataset.

AB Although neighborhood rough set(NRS) based attribute reduction methods have achieved excellent performance in many scenarios, the efficiency and robustness of these methods have not attracted much attention. In this study, we propose a fast fixed granular-ball model (FFGB) for attribute reduction in label noise environments. In FFGB, we propose a fast neighborhood search mechanism to improve the efficiency of NRS. This fast mechanism reduces the neighborhood search range from the universe to a neighborhood and reduces the time complexity of the neighborhood calculation to much less than O(n(2)). Based on the fast mechanism, we propose FFGB model whose definitions are relaxed to be robust to against label noise. In addition, a FFGB attribute reduction algorithm is designed. Finally, we apply the FFGB attribute reduction to medical diagnosis. The experimental results indicate that FFGB is more efficient and robust than the comparison methods.

AB Predicting students' performance in distance courses is a very relevant task to help teachers identify students who need reinforcement or extension activities. Nevertheless, identifying the student's progress is highly complicated due to the large number of students and the lack of direct interaction. Artificial intelligence algorithms contribute to overcoming this problem by automatically analyzing the features and interactions of each student with the e-learning platform. The main limitations of the previous proposals are that they do not consider a ranking between the different marks obtained by students and the most accurate models are usually black boxes without comprehensibility. This paper proposes to use an optimized ordinal classification algorithm, FlexNSLVOrd, that performs a prediction of student's performance in four ranking classes (Withdrawn < Fail < Pass < Distinction) by generating highly understandable models. The experimental study uses the OULA dataset and compares 10 state-of-the-art methods on 7 different courses and 3 classical classification metrics. The results, validated with statistical analysis, show that FlexNSLVOrd has higher performance than the other models and achieves significant differences with the rest of the proposals. In addition, the interpretability of FlexNSLVOrd is compared with other rule-based models, and simpler and more representative rules are obtained.

DE Diabetic retinopathy (DR); Transformer; CNN; Multiclass classification;
   Ordinal regression; KC loss
AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic complication of diabetes that damages the retinal blood vessels, leading to impaired vision and even blindness, and is one of the top three eye diseases causing human blindness. An effective DR grading algorithm can help ophthalmologists to diagnose patients and improve efficiency. Therefore, we propose a fusion network based on transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform DR grading. The proposed approach addresses two critical issues in the task: i) The CNN-based DR classification method has a small receptive field, so the range of available information is limited. The Transformer-based DR classification method has a large receptive field, but it is easy to lose local details; ii) Existing approaches treat DR grading as a traditional multiclass classification task, which ignores ordinal information between DR of different levels. To address i), we fuse the multi-level features of CNN and Transformer at different stages, and realize the enhancement and interaction of local and global information through the fusion module. To address ii), we propose a KC loss by formulating DR grading as a joint ordinal regression and multiclass classification problem, and obtain both category-supervised information and ordinal supervised information. Extensive qualitative and quantitative assessments have shown that our approach achieves superior performance on publicly available DeepDR and IDRiD datasets.

Our approach takes into account contact information in the design of the reward function, resulting in improved success rates, generalization for unseen objects, and task efficiency compared to policies that do not consider contact information. Through reinforcement learning using only one object in simulation, we obtain a learned policy for manipulating a single object, which demonstrates good generalization when applied to the task of pushing unseen objects. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios.

AB System disturbances, such as the change of required service durations, the failure of resources, and temporary tasks during the scheduling process of data relay satellite network (DRSN), are difficult to be predicted, which may lead to unsuccessful scheduling of tasks. A high-efficiency and robust DRSN calls for smarter and more flexible disturbances elimination strategies. Here, we unify the above three system disturbances as temporary task arrival and extend the static scheduling model of DRSN. Specifically, we derive and define a scheduling model that unifies the static scheduling and dynamic scheduling processes. Meanwhile, we propose a k-step dynamic scheduling algorithm considering breakpoint transmission (k-steps-BT) to solve the above model. Based on the principle of backtracking algorithm and search tree, k-steps-BT can eliminate disturbances quickly by rescheduling tasks and can determine the rescheduling scheme when temporary tasks arrive. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to verify the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the proposed model and algorithm can significantly improve the task completion rate of dynamic scheduling without drastic adjustments to the static scheduling scheme.

ID SUPERRESOLUTION
AB Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown great power in single image super resolution (SISR) reconstruction, and achieving significant improvements over traditional methods. Despite the great success of these CNN-based methods, direct application of these methods to some edge devices is impractical due to the large computational overhead required. To address this problem, a novel, lightweight SISR network focusing on speed and accuracy, called the multi-path feedback fusion network (MFFN), has been designed in this paper. Specifically, in order to extract features more effectively, the authors propose a novel fusion attention feedback block (FAFB) as the main building block of MFFN. The FAFB consists of a backbone branch and several hierarchical branches. The backbone branch is composed of stacked enhanced pixel attentional blocks (EPAB), which are responsible for incremental deep feature learning on the feature map. And the hierarchical branches are responsible for extracting feature maps with different sizes of receptive fields and fusing these feature maps with the features extracted from the trunk branches to achieve multi-scale feature learning, which the authors refer to this design as the multi-scale fusion block (MSFB). Extra enhancement information (EIE) is added to each EPAB input, which enables the backbone branch to learn more effectively. On the other hand, the outputs of the cascade branches are further complemented by an additional feedback fusion enhancement block (FFEB) before being fused with the output of the trunk branches to achieve more comprehensive and accurate feature learning. Numerous experiments have shown that MFFN achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark test sets.

AB Accurate fish size measurement in breeding areas is crucial for the fishing industry. Unlike acoustic methods with high equipment cost and low measurement accuracy, current image-based methods offer a promising alternative. However, these image-based methods still face challenges in selecting measurement points. To address this issue and achieve precise measurements of individual fish, this paper introduces an automatic fish size measurement method based on key point detection. We established a Fish-Keypoints dataset and utilized deep learning techniques for the detection of fish and their key points. Using a binocular camera system, we reconstruct a three-dimensional coordinate system to measure key points at the fish's head and tail, facilitating fish length calculation. The detection model achieves an accuracy of 85.1% in key point detection. The proposed method is tested in both land and underwater environments, demonstrating a relative measurement error of approximately 7% for fish in pools. This confirms the proposed method's ability to accurately detect measurement points, offering superior accuracy compared to other methods.
   The automatic measurement of the fish size in the breeding area is of vital importance to fishery. The current imagebased methods can overcome the shortcomings of the acoustic methods, that is, high-priced equipment and low measurement accuracy. However, these image-based methods still have certain defects in the selection of measurement points. An automatic fish size measurement method based on key point detection is proposed here, which aimed to tackle the problem of measurement point selection and achieve accurate measurement of a single fish. This paper establishes a dataset of Fish-Keypoints and uses a deep learning method to realize the detection of fish and its key points. Based on the binocular camera system, the three-dimensional coordinate system was reconstructed, and the key points of the head and tail were measured to calculate the length. The detection model has achieved 85.1% accuracy for key points detection. Also, experiments to verify the proposed algorithm on land and in underwater scenes were conducted, and the relative error of the measurements for fish in the pool was around 7%. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect the measurement points and compared to other methods, it is more accurate. Moreover, the key point detection method has a certain potential and lays a good foundation for image-based methods to analyse the posture and skeleton of a single fish.image

ID IDENTIFICATION; APPLES; SYSTEM
AB Yellow peaches are soft, and they bruise easily; the bruised areas of them are prone to breed bacteria and molds, so the consumption and the safety of related products of yellow peaches are affected by the difference in the storage time of light bruises in them. In order to accurately distinguish of the storage time of light bruises in yellow peaches, the spectra of the sample bruised region were combined with texture features extracted based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the deep learning algorithm was used for modeling. A total of 80 samples were prepared in the experiment, and the hyperspectral images of them were acquired at four time periods (2, 8, 24, and 48 h), and the reflection spectral data as well as the texture features of the bruised samples were extracted from the hyperspectral images. First, the random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were built based on spectral, texture, and spectral features combined with texture features (Feature Fusion 1), respectively, and the best model discrimination was the RF model under Feature Fusion 1, with an overall accuracy of 98.33%. In order to remove the redundant information of spectrum, the UVE and CARS algorithms were used to screen the normalized spectral feature data, and then, the texture features were combined again (Feature Fusion 2), and the RF and XGBoost models were built. The results show that the optimal model for distinguishing the storage time of yellow peaches after bruising is the RF model under Feature Fusion 2 (CARS), with an overall accuracy of 98.33%. In summary, this study shows that spectral features combined with texture features can be used to effectively improve the model's discrimination of storage time after bruising of yellow peaches, and it also provides a certain theoretical basis for hyperspectral imaging technology to discriminate storage time after bruising of fruits.
   In this paper, the spectral information and texture feature information in hyperspectral images were fused, and random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models were built. The uninformed variable elimination and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling algorithms were used to improve the accuracy of the model to discriminate the storage time of yellow peaches after light bruising.

AB Temperature variation directly affects the melting and solidification process of welding and has a significant impact on weld quality and mechanical properties. Accurately acquiring real-time temperature variations during the welding process is crucial for the real-time detection of welding defects. In this study, a novel thin-film thermocouple (TFTC) sensor that offers fast response, easy installation and no damage to the temperature measurement surface was designed and developed to obtain real-time temperature variations during the metal inert gas (MIG) welding process of aluminium alloys. A random forest-based weld defect identification model was established with an accuracy of 97.14% for the four typical defects of incomplete penetration, nonfusion, undercutting and collapses, which occur in the three-layer, three-pass welding process. Subsequently, a random forest model based on the temperature signal was used to analyse the hardness, bending and tensile properties of the welded joints, demonstrating the feasibility of directly using the weld temperature signal to assess the mechanical properties of welded joints.

AB Crop population and inter-plant spacing in corn farms can provide useful insight into plant phenotypic analysis and informed establishment decisions, improving crop productivity. Traditionally, farmers have relied on manual inspection to assess crop consistency, such as counting plant stands and manually estimating plant spacing. This assessment is carried out in small predefined areas, leading to insufficient crop consistency analysis on the entire field. Moreover, alternative computer vision techniques computing only one or two key parameters also prove insufficient for accurate crop consistency assessment. This research presents a framework called QuanCro that utilizes red-green-blue images from field machinery to analyze crop parameters such as plant stands counting, plant emergence rate, and plant spacing. It utilizes the state-of-the-art object detection network-You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7), to locate and count corn plants combined with our proposed semantic segmentation model, Small Pyramid-UNet (SP-UNet) architecture, to determine leaf area index. This architecture is designed to be memory efficient and computationally less expensive than similar networks, such as HRNet_Mscale (72.1M) and SegNet (34.65M), as it has approximately 21M parameters. The SP-UNet is further integrated with the Zhang-Suen thinning technique and progressive probabilistic Hough transform for crop row detection and plant spacing information. QuanCro accurately estimates crop densities and identifies inconsistent crop areas. The method is tested using 8000 images and shows a mean average precision of 0.976 for identifying plant stands. The SP-UNet achieves intersection over union scores of 0.973, 0.924, and 0.926 for crops, rows, and backgrounds, respectively.

AB The emergence of digital media has changed the way people live and learn. In the context of the new era, digital media is gradually integrating into people's life and learning. Digital media contains massive images, and fine-grained image recognition for digital media has become an important topic. The challenge of fine-grained image recognition is that the difference between different categories is small, and the difference between the same categories is sometimes large. This work designs a fine-grained image recognition based on feature enhancement (FIRFE). This extracts as much information as possible from fine-grained images under weak supervision to improve the recognition accuracy. When the existing methods extract image features, the feature extraction other than the most significant local feature is not enough. This deals with local features alone and ignores the relationship between features. First, this paper designs a feature enhancement and suppression module to process image features. Secondly, this paper designs pyramid residual convolution. This uses different scale convolution kernels to capture different levels of features in the scene. Thirdly, this paper uses the softpool method to rationally allocate the information weight in the pooling process. Fourth, this paper uses feature focus module to mine more features. This focuses on obtaining similar information in multiple local features as discriminant features to further improve the recognition. Fifthly, this paper carried out systematic experiments on the designed method. The proposed method achieves 94.3%/95.7% accuracy, 92.9%/94.1% recall, and 91.4%/92.2% F1 score on different datasets. This verified the superiority of this method for fine-grained image recognition of digital media.

AB This paper presents a new Data-Driven Teaching Learning-Based Optimization (DDTLBO) method used to improve the self-balancing and position control of a two-degree of freedom ball and balancer (2DOFBB) system. DDTLBO is a modified version of teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) method, based on the natural pattern followed by "learners" in an academic class to improve their knowledge. In this, an intelligent algorithm is used on MATLAB platform to handle the nonlinearities and un-stability of the ball and balancer system. A ball-balancer is a highly nonlinear, electromechanical, multivariable and underactuated system. A sophisticated automated intelligent control approach is used to handle these complications. In the proposed approach, the pattern followed by inclination angle of balancer plate is traced after observing the control dynamics of 2DOFBB system. Modeling of ball balancer system is accomplished with the help of proportional integral and derivative (PID) controller. Further, an intelligent data-driven computational approach is implemented, which improves the execution of TLBO optimization method. This improved optimization is used to tune the performance of proportional integral derivative controller employed on the ball balancer system. This approach addresses the major challenge of unknown disturbances on the closed loop system of the considered problem. The dominance of proposed intelligent approach is verified over other optimization techniques using benchmark CEC functions. The optimized parameters of PID controllers hence obtained are implemented on 2DOFBB system. Results obtained are validated using real-time response analysis on the MATLAB/Simulation platform, which demonstrates the dominance of DDTLBO-PID controller over traditional controllers.

AB The welding defect classification method based on deep learning often faces problems such as insufficient training data and complex model structures, which affect its real-time performance. Therefore, a welding defect classification method based on lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. The problems of insufficient and unbalanced welding defect image are solved by using the generative adversarial networks (GANs) data augmentation method. A lightweight CNN model is developed, which reduces the structural parameters under the premise of ensuring classification accuracy. The feature data of each convolution layer are visualized to verify the feasibility of the model and improve the interpretability of the model. By comparing the accuracy and real-time performance with other lightweight models, the excellent performance of the proposed model in welding defect classification is verified. Additionally, our model achieves 98.25% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

DE Traditional clothing; graphical style migration; cross-attention
   mechanism; linear transformation; feature retention
AB To address the issues in clothing pattern style migration, this paper proposes a digital simulation and re-editing method for clothing patterns based on deep learning and somatosensory interaction. First, the proposed method encodes the black-and-white line drawing image, generating random noise images through a diffusion process, introducing color information for synthesis, and using a decoder to reconstruct a colored image. Afterwards, an improved VGG19 model is used to reconstruct content features and perform linear color transformation on style images, enabling pattern style migration through the construction of a Gram matrix and resulting in colored clothing texture patterns. Finally, a KinectV2 is utilized for fabric simulation, overlaying colorful clothing texture patterns to achieve 3D virtual dressing. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) by 9-11% and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 3-8% when compared to existing algorithms. The experiments provide evidence that the proposed method effectively mitigates color overflow, delivers precise image coloring, and accomplishes realistic restoration of clothing texture. Furthermore, the method offers an improved garment fit to fulfill the user's interaction requirements.

AB In this paper, we consider the issue of digital camera identification based on images. This topic matches the area of digital forensics. The problem is well known in the literature and many algorithms based on camera's fingerprint have been proposed. In this paper, we discuss the digital camera identification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNNs are state-of-the-art method in computer vision and are widely utilized in many applications. Our goal is to find out whether it is possible to speed up the process of learning the networks by the images. We conduct a set of representative experiments which show that replacing the ReLU with SELU activation function and adjusting the network's hyperparamethers (e.g. learning rate) may have a significant impact on reduction time of learning. We also consider using the dropout layer. The experiments are held on representative image dataset, consisting of many images coming from modern cameras and show effectiveness of our propositions.

DE Adversarial examples; transfer-based attacks; cognitive bias; neural
   networks; robustness; confidence score
AB Transfer-based attacks, a type of adversarial attack, have become a growing threat in recent years with the proliferation of cloud services. Deep neural networks that exploit human cognitive bias (Loosely Symmetric-Deep Neural Network, LS-DNN) are known as a defensive technique against transfer-based attacks. LS-DNN can prevent malfunctions caused by adversarial examples with a high probability by incorporating human learning characteristics into the neural network's nodes. However, maintaining accuracy against normal data and reducing Training Time is challenging. This paper proposes a new model called "LS+-DNN" inspired by the Dropout method to solve this problem. Evaluation experiments on two datasets show that the proposed model can achieve both in high dimensions. In addition, we analyze the proposed model focusing on the variance and confidence score of the training parameters of the proposed model. As a result, we point out that the confidence score is an important indicator of robust models against transfer-based attacks.

AB Wildfires are among the most threatening hazards to life, property, well-being, and the environment. Studying public opinions about wildfires can help monitor the perception of the impacted communities. Nevertheless, wildfire research is relatively limited compared to other climate-related hazards. This article presents our data mining work on public opinions about wildfires in Australia from 2014 to 2021. Three key aspects are analyzed: the topic of concern, sentiment polarization, and perceived emotions. We propose a data filtering approach to acquire golden samples to train a supervised model for emotion quantification to achieve the last target. The results show that the new model produces a more accurate emotion estimation than the existing lexicon approach. Through data analysis, we find that people have seen wildfires as one of the impacts of climate change; trends of tweets can reflect the damage of wildfires in real life.

AB The Internet provides a wide variety of information that can be collected and studied, creating a massive data repository. Among the data available on the Internet, we can find articles about Violence against Women (VAW) published in the digital press, which are of great societal interest. In this work, we utilizedWeb scraping techniques to gather VAW-related news from the internet. Applying Text Mining techniques, we conducted a study on VAW and its characteristics. Our work comprises an exploratory analysis and the application of Topic Modelling to VAW events to identify latent topics and their semantic structures. We employed classification algorithms on a set ofVAWpress articles to determine the type of violence they refer to, namely physical, psychological, sexual, or a combination of them. We proposed two methodologies to target the data: the first one is based on dictionaries of VAWtypes, while the second approach extends the former by using the predominant violence to identify other associated types. Furthermore, we implemented two feature selection techniques: TF-IDF and Chi 2. Then, we applied Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Bayesian Networks, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks. The results obtained showed that the classifiers achieved better performance when using Chi 2. The Boost Classifier demonstrated the best performance, followed by Random Forest.

AB In this paper, a heap-based optimizer algorithm with chaotic search has been presented for the global solution of nonlinear programming problems. Heap-based optimizer (HBO) is a modern human social behavior-influenced algorithm that has been presented as an effective method to solve nonlinear programming problems. One of the difficulties that faces HBO is that it falls into locally optimal solutions and does not reach the global solution. To recompense the disadvantages of such modern algorithm, we integrate a heap-based optimizer with a chaotic search to reach the global optimization for nonlinear programming problems. The proposed algorithm displays the advantages of both modern techniques. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is inspected on a wide scale of different 42 problems including unimodal, multi-modal test problems, and CEC-C06 2019 benchmark problems. The comprehensive results have shown that the proposed algorithm effectively deals with nonlinear programming problems compared with 11 highly cited algorithms in addressing the tasks of optimization. As well as the rapid performance of the proposed algorithm in treating nonlinear programming problems has been proved as the proposed algorithm has taken less time to find the global solution.

AB A deep convolution neural network image segmentation model based on a cost-effective active learning mechanism is proposed and named PolySeg Plus. It is intended to address polyp segmentation with a lack of labeled data and a high false-positive rate of polyp discovery. In addition to applying active learning, which assisted in labeling more image samples, a comprehensive polyp dataset formed of five benchmark datasets was generated to increase the number of images. To enhance the captured image features, the locally shared feature method is used, which utilizes the power of employing neighboring features together with one another to improve the quality of image features and overcome the drawbacks of the Conditional Random Features method. Medical image segmentation was performed using ResUNet++, ResUNet, UNet++, and UNet models. Gaussian noise was removed from the images using a gaussian filter, and the images were then augmented before being fed into the models. In addition to optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning, grid search is used to select the optimum parameters to maximize model performance. The results demonstrated a significant improvement and applicability of the proposed method in polyp segmentation when compared to state-of-the-art methods on the datasets CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS Larib Polyp DB, KVASIR-SEG, and Kvasir-Sessile, with Dice coefficients of 0.9558, 0.8947, 0.7547, 0.9476, and 0.6023, respectively. Not only did the suggested method improve the dice coefficients on the individual datasets, but it also produced better results on the comprehensive dataset, which will contribute to the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems.

AB The number of visual distraction-caused crashes highlights a need for non-visual displays in the in-vehicle information system (IVIS). Audio-supported air gesture controls can tackle this problem. Twenty-four young drivers participated in our experiment using a driving simulator with six different gesture prototypes-3 modality types (visual-only, visual/auditory, and auditory-only) x 2 control orientation types (horizontal and vertical). Various data were obtained, including lane departures, eye glance behavior, secondary task performance, and driver workload. Results showed that the auditory-only displays showed a significantly lower lane departures and perceived workload. A tradeoff between eyes-on-road time and secondary task completion time for the auditory-only display was also observed, which means the safest, but slowest among the prototypes. Vertical controls (direct manipulation) showed significantly lower workload than horizontal controls (mouse metaphor), but did not differ in performance measures. Experimental results are discussed in the context of multiple resource theory and design guidelines for future implementation.

AB A software project measurement model plays a crucial role in assessing, monitoring, and improving software development processes and product quality. However, existing models often focus on localized optimization, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces the 5P model to software project measurement, aiming to achieve global optimization and control. The article presents a conceptual overview of the 5P model and a detailed illustration of its steps using a real development process. By adopting a system thinking approach, the proposed model enables global optimization by aligning project objectives, product outcomes, and stakeholders' needs. Three feedback loops are utilized to ensure the alignment of project purposes, performance measurement, and stakeholder requirements. The 5P model provides transparent metrics, enabling stakeholders to track progress and make informed decisions. Results confirm the model's significant value in software project measurement, facilitating improved project outcomes and stakeholder satisfaction.

AB Several existing group decision-making strategies and their hybrid models, such as soft expert sets (SESs), dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs), and hesitant fuzzy SESs, have proven to be valuable in resolving issues of many daily-life situations involving uncertainty. However, the hybridization of different existing uncertainty theories, particularly DHFSs and SESs, remains unexplored in the literature. To further enhance decision-making capabilities, the specific goal of this study is to extend the DHFS model to its extreme within the soft expert framework. For achieving this, we combine DHFSs with SESs as a new hybrid model called dual hesitant fuzzy soft expert sets (DHFSESs) to better handle uncertain situations in group decision-making. Furthermore, we investigate some basic properties and operations of the developed model and explain these notions with corresponding numerical examples, such as subset relation, complement, union, intersection, the 'OR' operation, the 'AND' operation, and level SESs of the developed DHFSESs. Additionally, we verify that the presented model obeys commutative, associative, and De Morgan's laws. To demonstrate the practicality of the DHFSES model, we solve a real-world multi criteria group decision-making problem (prediction of results in an upcoming local election scenario) by incorporating dual hesitant fuzzy soft expert knowledge that is supported by an algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the authenticity and feasibility of the proposed DHFSES model by comparing it with some preexisting approaches, including dual hesitant fuzzy soft sets and hesitant fuzzy SESs, to validate its advantages over them.

   evaluation; Adversarial training; Time series forecasting; Deep learning
AB In recent years, researchers proposed a variety of deep learning models for wind power forecasting. These models predict the wind power generation of wind farms or entire regions more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms or physical models. However, latest research has shown that deep learning models can often be manipulated by adversarial attacks. Since wind power forecasts are essential for the stability of modern power systems, it is important to protect them from this threat. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semi-targeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. We consider a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for predicting the power generation of individual wind farms and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for forecasting the wind power generation throughout Germany. Moreover, we propose the Total Adversarial Robustness Score (TARS), an evaluation metric for quantifying the robustness of regression models to targeted and semi-targeted adversarial attacks. It assesses the impact of attacks on the model's performance, as well as the extent to which the attacker's goal was achieved, by assigning a score between 0 (very vulnerable) and 1 (very robust). In our experiments, the LSTM forecasting model was fairly robust and achieved a TARS value of over 0.78 for all adversarial attacks investigated. The CNN forecasting model only achieved TARS values below 0.10 when trained ordinarily, and was thus very vulnerable. Yet, its robustness could be significantly improved by adversarial training, which always resulted in a TARS above 0.46.

AB Currently, there is a significant amount of research being conducted in the field of artificial intelligence to improve the explainability and interpretability of deep learning models. It is found that if end-users understand the reason for the production of some output, it is easier to trust the system. Recommender systems are one example of systems that great efforts have been conducted to make their output more explainable. One method for producing a more explainable output is using counterfactual reasoning, which involves altering minimal features to generate a counterfactual item that results in changing the output of the system. This process allows the identification of input features that have a significant impact on the desired output, leading to effective explanations. In this paper, we present a method for generating counterfactual explanations for both tabular and textual features. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on three real-world datasets and demonstrated a +5% improvement on finding effective features (based on model-based measures) compared to the baseline method.

DE Generative adversarial network; Robustness; Generalization
AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most popular and powerful models to learn the complex high dimensional distributions. However, they usually suffer from instability and generalization issues which may lead to poor generations. Most existing works focus on stabilizing the training for the discriminators of GANs while ignoring their generalization issue. In this work, we aim to improve the generalization capability of GANs by promoting the local robustness within the small neighborhood of the training samples. We prove that the robustness in the small neighborhood of the training sets can lead to better generalization. Particularly, we design a new robust method called Robust Generative Adversarial Network (RGAN) in which the generator and discriminator compete with each other in a worst-case setting within a small Wasserstein ball. The generator tries to map the worst input distribution (rather than a Gaussian distribution used in most GANs) to the real data distribution, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish the real and fake distributions with the worst perturbations. Intuitively, the proposed RGAN can learn a good generator and discriminator that can even perform well on the worst-case input points. Strictly, we have proved that RGAN can obtain a tighter generalization upper bound than the traditional GANs under mild assumptions, ensuring a theoretical superiority of RGAN over GANs. We conduct our proposed method on five different baselines (five popular GAN models). And a series of experiments on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and CelebA datasets indicate that our proposed robust frameworks outperform five baseline models substantially and consistently.

ID DATA FUSION
AB Deep sequential networks have shown great power in time series regression and classification. So far, most approaches naturally assume that the time sequential data are uniformly sampled. In practice, however, different variables usually have different sampling rates, thereby forming multi-rate time series (MR-TS). Particularly, the target variable (i.e., label) to be predicted usually has a lower sampling frequency due to the difficulty of manual annotations. The multi-rate problem poses two challenges. One is the diverse dynamics at different sampling rates, which is defined as multi-scale dynamics. The other is label scarcity. To tackle the above obstacles, this paper developed a Multi-scale Self-supervised Representation Learning technique with a Temporal Alignment mechanism (MSRL-TA) as a coherent framework. Concretely, a probabilistic masked autoencoding approach is pertinently developed, in which segment-wise masking schemes and rate-aware positional encodings are devised to enable the characterization of multi-scale temporal dynamics. In the course of pre-training, the encoder networks are able to generate rich and holistic representations of multi-rate data, thereby alleviating the label scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning. Furthermore, a Temporal Alignment mechanism is devised to refine synthesized features for dynamic predictive modeling through feature block division and block-wise convolution. With empirical evaluation through extensive experiments, our proposed MSRL-TA achieved consistent state-of-the-art in both multi-rate time series regression and classification tasks on five real-world datasets, including air quality prediction, industrial soft sensing, human activity recognition, and speech voice classification.

AB Dedicated hybrid engine technology using auxiliary electronic components has been proven as an energy-saving solution to public concerns about energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper proposes a generic approach of K-fold filter-collaborated feature selection (KFFC-FS) to robustly identify the key parameters of three engine performance indicators, i.e., volumetric efficiency, thermal efficiency, and fuel consumption. By using this approach, five filters are collaborated to provide a robust rank of feature importance and avoid the feature overestimation caused by the single filter. Meanwhile, the K-fold cross validation method is introduced to avoid random precision issues and overfitting, further enhancing the robustness of key parameter identification for the independent engine performance indicators. In this research, the modelling data is collected from an experi-mental test bench with a BYD 1.5L gasoline engine. Under the basics of the studied three engine performance indicators by using a multiple-layer perceptron network, the proposed approach further reduces by at least 10.3% root-mean-square error (RMSE) and at least 30% reduction of the model inputs.

ID TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; DOMAIN THEORY
AB In this study, we develop a machine learning modeling approach to the prediction of the hysteretic Boundary Drying (BD) curves of unsaturated porous media from the known Boundary Wetting (BW) curves, measured at a constant void ratio. The relationship between the families of BW and BD curves of the porous media is considered to consist of regular and random constituents, and it is represented by a limited set of N known pairs of these curves. Prediction of the desired BD curve from its associated known BW curve of some porous medium is obtained as a product of two mappings: (i) a nonlinear mapping of the known BW curve to its corresponding Hypothetical Drying (HD) curve, as defined in "The modified dependent-domain theory of hysteresis" of Mualem (1984, 2009) and (ii) a linear mapping of this HD curve to the desired BD curve. The latter mapping is performed by an optimization algorithm based on a training set of k known BW-BD pairs (k <= N) of the k corresponding porous media. The predicted BD curves indicate a generally good agreement with the measured ones. An advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility of permanently updating the suggested model by incorporating new measured data.

AB Sleep staging is essential in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders, but the lack of labeled data impedes the development of automatic sleep staging models. Generally, institutions rely on semi-supervised approaches to enhance the utilization of their own unlabeled data. However, the task knowledge obtained from a limited amount of labeled data is often insufficient to guide the learning based on large amounts of unlabeled data, which may even lead to catastrophic forgetting and further degrade the performance of most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy of building secure collaboration among multiple institutions, to achieve the implicit augmentation of labeled data and expansion of task knowledge for each participating institution by acquiring external knowledge from others. We adopt the Federated Learning (FL) to facilitate secure collaboration and propose a federated semi-supervised sleep staging method based on knowledge sharing, which enables the automatic scoring of sleep stages using only single-channel EEG data. The task knowledge in our method is contained in relationships, which exist naturally among sleep stages and can be extracted from both local labeled and unlabeled data. Furthermore, the knowledge sharing among participating institutions can be achieved by aligning the local relationships to the aggregated global relationships. Additionally, we employ prototype-contrastive learning to enhance the clarity of relationships extracted from labeled data, and propose pseudo-labeling optimization to generate reliable pseudo-labels for subsequent relationship extraction from unlabeled data. Our method is shown to be effective and outperforms compared methods in extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets.

AB By introducing local recovery networks, regional and local environmental authorities can play an important role in facilitating the circular economy. This paper studies a network design problem that encompasses the recovery of separately collected household waste streams, which are collected in containers at civic amenity sites. We formulate a generic tactical-operational container collection problem that will be solved using a mixed integer linear programming approach. This paper makes both a theoretical and practical contribution. We are the first to study a two container vehicle capacity restriction combined with collection site inventory capacities, time windows, shift break time, and shift duration constraints. The model is applied to a number of real-life test instances and scenarios. The results provide insight in how different combinations of scenarios exactly affect the fleet requirements. This not only includes the number of trucks or information under which circumstances an additional truck would (not) be needed, but also the 12-day collection schedule for the collection crews.

ID EFFICIENT ALGORITHM
AB There are various cluster validity indices used for evaluating clustering results. One of the main objectives of using these indices is to seek the optimal unknown number of clusters. Some indices work well for clusters with different densities, sizes, and shapes. Yet, one shared weakness of those validity indices is that they often provide only one optimal number of clusters. That number is unknown in real-world problems, and there might be more than one possible option. We develop a new cluster validity index based on a correlation between an actual distance between a pair of data points and a centroid distance of clusters that the two points occupy. Our proposed index constantly yields several local peaks and overcomes the previously stated weakness. Several experiments in different scenarios, including UCI real-world data sets, have been conducted to compare the proposed validity index with several well-known ones.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to recommend items based on anonymous behavior sequences. However, most existing SBR approaches focus solely on the current session while neglecting the item-transition information from other sessions, which suffer from the inability of modeling the complicated item-transition. To address the limitations, we introduce global item-transition information to augment the modeling of item-transitions. Specifically, we first propose a basic GNN-based framework (BGNN), which solely uses session-level item-transition information. Based on BGNN, we propose a novel approach, called Session -based Recommendation with Global Information (SRGI), which infers the user preferences via fully exploring item-transitions over all sessions from two different perspectives: (i) Fusion-based Model (SRGI-FM), which recursively incorporates the neighbor embeddings of each node on global graph into the learning process of item representation; and (ii) Constrained-based Model (SRGI-CM), which treats the global-level information as a constraint to ensure the learned item embeddings are consistent with the global item-transition. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that both SRGI-FM and SRGI-CM outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Most of us are not experts in specific fields, such as ornithology. Nonetheless, we do have general image and language understanding capabilities that we use to match what we see to expert resources. This allows us to expand our knowledge and perform novel tasks without ad-hoc external supervision. On the contrary, machines have a much harder time consulting expert-curated knowledge bases unless trained specifically with that knowledge in mind. Thus, in this paper we consider a new problem: fine-grained image recognition without expert annotations, which we address by leveraging the vast knowledge available in web encyclopedias. First, we learn a model to describe the visual appearance of objects using non-expert image descriptions. We then train a fine-grained textual similarity model that matches image descriptions with documents on a sentence-level basis. We evaluate the method on two datasets (CUB-200 and Oxford-102 Flowers) and compare with several strong baselines and the state of the art in cross-modal retrieval.

AB We propose a method for constructing generative models of 3D objects from a single 3D mesh and improving them through unsupervised low-shot learning from 2D images. Our method produces a 3D morphable model that represents shape and albedo in terms of Gaussian processes. Whereas previous approaches have typically built 3D morphable models from multiple high-quality 3D scans through principal component analysis, we build 3D morphable models from a single scan or template. As we demonstrate in the face domain, these models can be used to infer 3D reconstructions from 2D data (inverse graphics) or 3D data (registration). Specifically, we show that our approach can be used to perform face recognition using only a single 3D template (one scan total, not one per person). We extend our model to a preliminary unsupervised learning framework that enables the learning of the distribution of 3D faces using one 3D template and a small number of 2D images. Our approach is motivated as a potential model for the origins of face perception in human infants, who appear to start with an innate face template and subsequently develop a flexible system for perceiving the 3D structure of any novel face from experience with only 2D images of a relatively small number of familiar faces.

AB We present a formation-control algorithm for autonomous fixed-wing air vehicles. The desired inter-vehicle positions are time-varying, and we assume that at least one vehicle has access to a measurement its position relative to the leader, which can be a physical or virtual member of the formation. Each vehicle is modeled with extended unicycle dynamics that include orientation kinematics on SO(3), speed dynamics, and strict constraints on speed (i.e., ground speed). The analytic result shows that the vehicles converge exponentially to the desired relative positions with each other and the leader. We also show that each vehicle's speed satisfies the speed constraints. The formation algorithm is demonstrated in software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations and experiments with fixed-wing air vehicles. To implement the formation-control algorithm, each vehicle has middle-loop controllers to determine roll, pitch, and throttle commands from the outer-loop formation control. We present SITL simulations with 4 fixed-wing air vehicles that demonstrate formation control with different communication structures. Finally, we present formation-control experiments with up to 3 fixed-wing air vehicles.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to collect time series through wearable devices to precisely identify specific actions. However, the traditional HAR method ignores the activity variances among individuals, which will cause low generalization when applied to a new individual and indirectly enhance the difficulties of personalized HAR service. In this paper, we fully consider activity divergence among individuals to develop an end-to-end model, the multi-source unsupervised co-transfer network (MUCT), to provide personalized activity recognition for new individuals. We denote the collected data of different individuals as multiple domains and implement deep domain adaptation to align each pair of source and target domains. In addition, we propose a consistent filter that utilizes two heterogeneous classifiers to automatically select high-confidence instances from the target domain to jointly enhance the performance on the target task. The effectiveness and performance of our model are evaluated through comprehensive experiments on two activity recognition benchmarks and a private activity recognition data set (collected by our signal sensors), where our model outperforms traditional transfer learning methods at HAR.

AB Computer vision has developed rapidly in recent years, invigorating the area of industrial surface defect detection while also providing it with modern perception capabilities. Few-shot learning has emerged as a result of sample size limitations, with MAML framework being the most widely used few-shot learning framework over the past few years that learns concepts from sampled classification tasks, which is considered to have the key advantage of aligning training and testing objectives. Industrial surface defects typically have fewer samples for training, so we propose MAML-based framework: Permute-MAML, which mainly consists of improved MAML framework and neural network model. In this paper, we concentrate on improving MAML framework with respect to its stability and explore a simple procedure: few-shot learning of its evaluation metrics over the whole classification model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the stability of MAML framework and achieves comparatively high accuracy in industrial surface defect detection.

AB Aquaculture net pen defects such as biofouling, vegetation, and holes are key challenges to efficient and sustainable fish production in aquaculture. These defects must be monitored to avoid problems with aquaculture net safety as well as fish growth. Recently, deep learning methods have been adopted to solve detection and classification problems in different applications. However, the conventional methods are challenging to meet the demands of high precision and real-time detection of aquaculture net defects in a complex marine environment. Towards this end, this paper proposes an autonomous net pen defect detection system that contains a novel multi-scale semantic segmentation topology for detecting the biofouling, vegetation, and hole problems in the aquaculture environment. In particular, we emphasize fusing the attention maps obtained across different decomposition levels of the network to generate rich feature distributions that enable the accurate extraction of biofouling, vegetation, and holes within aquaculture nets. Moreover, the proposed model is thoroughly tested on two private datasets and two public datasets which were acquired from a real-field fish farms. Across all four datasets, the proposed framework showed remarkable biofouling, vegetation, and hole detection performance, where it outperformed state-of-the-art methods by 6.58%, 3.69%, 6.44%, and 4.78% in terms of mean average precision across LABUST, KU, NDv1, and NDv2 datasets, respectively.

AB As giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are difficult to conceive and prone to abortion, humans have turned to artificial captive breeding to increase their population. Therefore, it is crucial for their reproduction to analyze their pregnancy status accurately and promptly in artificial captive breeding. To determine whether a giant panda is pregnant, with the current methods, experts must keep a close eye on them and frequently collect their urine or blood, which requires significant resources with a high misdiagnosis rate, and will adversely affect giant pandas' daily lives. Consequently, it is essential to rapidly advance the development of automated, precise methods that will not disrupt the pandas' lives to analyze giant pandas' behaviors and determine whether or not they are pregnant. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end intelligent system for predicting the pregnancy status of giant pandas and their Expected Date of Delivery (EDD). We first introduce expert knowledge to machine learning methods to solve this problem, which can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction. Experimental results show that this system achieves an accuracy of 91.5% for the pregnancy diagnosis and 0.579 days of mean average error for EDD prediction when the observation period is 5 days. Our automated system significantly reduces the need for human intervention, thus minimizing disruptions to the pandas' daily lives. It has the potential to contribute to the health and genetic diversity of the giant pandas, as well as aid in the panda's artificial reproduction and population growth.

AB The complete traffic network data is crucial for accurate traffic data prediction in intelligent transportation systems. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image restoration, this study proposes a traffic flow imputation method by employing image restoration techniques. First, we propose a trajectory data representation method called Trajectory2Matrix, that converts the trajectory data into a two-dimensional spatiotemporal relation feature map. Consequently, the data imputation scale and scope are increased. Second, a spatiotemporal feature map generation module based on a graph convolutional network is designed to optimize the GAN generator, thus utilizing its advantages for non-Euclidean data and dynamic spatiotemporal correlation. Finally, a heterogeneous multisource data fusion module based on a channel attention mechanism is proposed to merge dynamic/static external attributes and multimode characteristics in time. The proposed method improved imputation accuracy and robustness for multitype missing data patterns, especially in high missing rate situations.

AB In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) and auto-encoding (AE) have been widely utilized in multiple data mining problems. These architectures have demonstrated powers in data high-dimensional embedding for improving the performance of various task-driven learning tasks, like as clustering. However, most of recent GNN-based cluster techniques still suffered several limitations. These limitations are related to the capability of simultaneously preserving the low-levelled latent feature and global structural representations of the given network/graph. These view-varied graph representations can help to improve the performance of multi-scaled clustering task. Moreover, the achieved multi-viewed structural node embeddings which are learnt by GNN-based architectures might also involve with problems. These problems are related to feature noise and data uncertainty. These feature noise/uncertainties are occurred within representation learning process. These limitations can directly lead to the downgrade in the accuracy performance for clustering tasks. To overcome existing limitations, within this paper, we proposed a novel fuzzy-driven noise-reduced attention-based graph auto-encoding mechanism for network clustering, called as: FAGC. In general, our proposed FAGC model is as an attention-driven multi-layered graph-based AE architecture which is integrated with a custom de-noising fuzzy neural network. In our proposed FAGC model, we integrate the fuzzy neural network with GNN to eliminate problems which are related to the feature uncertainty and noise occurrence during the graph representation learning process. Later, the better quality as well as rich-structural network representations which are generated from our FAGC model are utilized to achieve state-of-the-art performances for the network clustering problem. The extensive experiments within benchmark networked datasets and comparative studies demonstrated the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed FAGC model in comparing with state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques.

AB Implementing intelligent irrigation and adjusting the irrigation system is essential in today's agricultural system to control the amount of water required for the plant. This study focuses on data obtained from sensors measuring (soil temperature and humidity, temperature and humidity of ambient and light) and image processing of plant leaves. To analyze the data, two models were implemented including a regression model in SPSS software and another model by genetic programming in MATLAB 2018 software. The optimal model was a combined model of sensors and images in genetic programming with higher R2 and lower standard error of 0.88 and 0.03, respectively. This model was superior to the regression model which had an R2 and standard error of 0.86 and 0.21, respectively, so this optimal model was selected to adjust the microcontroller for the intelligent irrigation system. The following year by replanting the crop, the intelligent irrigation system was presented as the superior system with 11% water saving compared to the previous year (irrigation by the user). Also, no changes were observed in the yield and color indicators of the plant at the level of 5%, which indicates the superiority of the intelligent irrigation system and its high accuracy of this system.

ID AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION
AB This paper presents a methodology for developing a volcano-seismic event classification system using a multi-station deep learning approach to support monitoring the Nevados del Chillan Volcanic Complex, which has been active since 2017. A convolutional network of multiple inputs processes the information from an event recorded up to five seismic stations. Each record is represented by its normalized spectrogram; thus, the network may receive from one to five spectrograms as input. The design includes entering additional information into the network, like the stations configuration and the event duration, information not provided by the spectrograms. Finally, this work includes the design and implementation of a relational database to access the continuous traces of events, showing different subsets of data quickly and efficiently. The results show that the classification of an event recorded up to five stations is substantially more effective than a single-station strategy. However, incorporating additional information of the signal does not significantly improve the classification performance.

AB Current visual question answering (VQA) has become a research hotspot in the computer vision and natural language processing field. A core solution of VQA is how to fuse multi-modal features from images and questions. This paper proposes a Multimodal Bi-direction Guided Attention Network (MBGAN) for VQA by combining visual relationships and attention to achieve more refined feature fusion. Specifically, the self-attention is used to extract image features and text features, the guided-attention is applied to obtain the correlation between each image area and the related question. To obtain the relative position relationship of different objects, position attention is further introduced to realize relationship correlation modeling and enhance the matching ability of multi-modal features. Given an image and a natural language question, the proposed MBGAN learns visual relation inference and question attention networks in parallel to achieve the fine-grained fusion of the visual features and the textual features, then the final answers can be obtained accurately through model stacking. MBGAN achieves 69.41% overall accuracy on the VQA-v1 dataset, 70.79% overall accuracy on the VQA-v2 dataset, and 68.79% overall accuracy on the COCO-QA dataset, which shows that the proposed MBGAN outperforms most of the state-of-the-art models.

AB Recently, graph based hashing has gained much attention due to its effectiveness in multi-media retrieval. Although several graph embedding based works have been designed and achieved promising performance, there are still some issues that need to be further studied, including, (1) one significant drawback of graph embedding is its expensive memory and computation cost caused by the graph Laplacian matrix; (2) most pioneer works fail to fully explore the available class labels in training procedure, which generally makes them suffer from unsatisfactory retrieval performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a simple yet effective supervised cross-media hashing scheme, termed Efficient Supervised Graph Embedding Hashing (ESGEH), which can simultaneously learn hash functions and discrete binary codes efficiently. Specifically, ESGEH leverages both class label based semantic embedding and graph embedding to generate a sharing semantic subspace, and class labels are also incorporated to minimize the quantization error for better approximating the generated binary codes. In order to reduce the computational sources, a well-designed intermediate terms decomposition is proposed to avoid explicitly computing the graph Laplacian matrix. Finally, an iterative discrete optimal algorithm is derived to solve above problem, and each subproblem can yield a closed-form solution. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over several existing cross-media hashing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

AB Reinforcement learning learns about the environment through the process of exploration, and the sufficient information collected during the interaction helps the agent to predict the future situation. However, uncontrolled exploration may cause the agent to stray into dangerous regions of the environment, leading to bad decisions and impairing the agent's performance. In order to address the issue, a framework, referred to as the policy guided by multi-step prediction (PGMP), is proposed. PGMP utilizes a curiosity mechanism based on multi-step prediction errors to stimulate exploration. To encourage the agent to explore safe or task-relevant areas, a safety bonus model is designed to determine whether the exploration area is safe or not by predicting the possible reward that can be gained. The combination of two intrinsic rewards serves as a curiosity model to give high returns to unknown states and possible safe actions. In addition, to avoid possible dangers in a limited number of future steps during exploration, a looking-ahead model is introduced to predict future multi-step states, actions, and rewards, respectively. Then, future information is combined with the policy network and included in the loss function of the policy update, allowing the agent to optimize its policy for predicted future states. Experiments on several tasks demonstrated that the proposed PGMP framework significantly improves the agent's performance.

ID DETECTION SYSTEM
AB With recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, more people can have instant and easy access to the IoT network of vast and diverse interconnected devices (e.g., surveillance cameras, motion sensors, or smart watches). This trend leads to a significant increase in the frequency and complexity of cyber attacks in the IoT network. Further, these attacks inflict severe financial and privacy damages to individuals and evince the need to develop a more effective and robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Network Intrusion Detection (NID) aims to identify the attacks in the networked devices, which is an essential task to protect and maintain Cyber Security. Although recent Machine Learning-based methods have developed and provided more efficient non-human intervention solutions to this problem, these methods still have some unsolved issues. One of the main limitations of existing solutions is that most focus on extracting the features at the flow level independently and ignore their interactions in the network, which impacts the detection performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Traffic-aware Self-supervised learning for IoT Network Intrusion Detection System, namely TS-IDS, which aims to capture the flow relationships between the network entities. Our approach leverages both node and edge features for improved performance. Additionally, we incorporate auxiliary property-based self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the graph representation, even in the absence of labelled data. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, NF-ToN-IoT and NF-BoT-IoT. We compared the proposed model with state-of-the-art baseline models to demonstrate the potential of our proposed framework. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interdependent dimensions including categorical and continuous variables can be seen commonly as heterogeneous behavioral data in the real world. Mixed-type objects are more or less associated in terms of certain coupling relationships. The usual representation of such behavioral data is an information table with explicit behavior exterior dimensions (i.e. the original attributes to describe data heterogeneity), assuming the independence of dimensions and the independence of objects. However, both variables and objects are actually very often interdependent on one another either explicitly or implicitly in functional and semantic manners. Limited research has been done in analyzing such interactions among dimensions and those relationships among objects, leading to the learning results to be more local than global. This paper proposes the interdependence analysis to capture the functional multifarious relationships among attributes and among objects in heterogeneous data by addressing the coupling context and coupling weights in unsupervised learning. Such global couplings consider the interactions within discrete dimensions, within numerical attributes and across them, as well as the relationships within an individual object and between multiple objects, to form the attribute-based and object-based coupled data representation schemes based on feature conversion and neighborhood calculation. In addition, we interpret both the representation models via implicit behavior interior dimensions (i.e. the newly defined attributes to model data interdependence) to explain the intrinsic rationales for the superiority of our proposed methods. This work explicitly models the coupling of multiple attributes and the coupling of multiple objects for heterogeneous data sets, demonstrated by various data mining and machine learning applications, such as cluster structure analysis, data clustering evaluation, and data density comparison. Moreover, the sensitivity study is carried out to tune the neighborhood parameter and weight parameter, and the scalability analysis is explored to test the robustness of both models. Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic data sets and multiple UCI data sets show that our proposed framework can effectively capture the global couplings of both heterogeneous variables and mixed-type objects, and is superior to the traditional way as well as the state-of-the-art approaches, which is also verified by statistical analysis.

AB The performance in restoring compressed multi-view video (MVV) of the existing learning-based methods is limited because they only utilize information of temporally adjacent frames or parallax neighboring views. However, the compression artifacts caused by multi-view coding (MVC) may be related to the reference errors of intra-frame, inter-frame, and interview. In this paper, with delicately utilizing the stereo information from both temporal and parallax domains, a motion-parallax complementation network (MPCNet) is proposed to restore the quality of compressed MVV more efficiently. First, we introduce a motion-parallax complementation strategy consisting of a coarse stage and a fine stage. By mutually compensating the feature extracted from multiple domains, useful multi-frame information can be efficiently preserved and aggregated step by step. Second, an attention-based feature filtering and modulation module (AFFM) is proposed, which provides an efficient fusion method for two features by suppressing misleading information. By deploying it in most submodules of the proposed approach, the representational ability of MPCNet can be improved, resulting in a more substantial restoration performance. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MPCNet by an average increase of 1.978 dB in PSNR, and 0.0282 in MS-SSIM. The BD-rate reduction can reach 47.342% on average. The subjective quality is greatly improved and lots of compression distortions are eliminated. Meanwhile, this work also benefits the accuracy improvement for high-level vision tasks, e.g., mIoU of semantic segmentation and mAP of object detection achieve 0.352 and 51.71, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that MPCNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many existing approaches to model and compute trust in a quantitative way rely on ranking, rating or assessments of agents by other agents. Even though reputation is related with trust, it does not capture all its characteristics. In parallel, many works in neuroscience shows evidence about interpersonal trust being an associative learning process encoded in the human brain. Inspired by other subjects such as Cognitive Processing/Dopamine, where Reinforcement Learning algorithms have served to model those phenomena, we propose a model for trust dynamics based on a multi-agent RL algorithm. We corroborate some trust concepts developed in social sciences within a quantitative framework. We do also propose and assess some metrics for a better understanding about the relation between the trust behaviour and the performance of the agents. Finally, we show that Trust, as described by our proposal, can serve to accelerate learning.

AB Differential evolution (DE) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA) are efficient and novel meta-heuristic algorithms, which are effective tools for solving global optimization problems (GOPs). However, a single algorithm is always restricted to its own principle and mechanism, and even suffers from the imbalance of global and local search ability when solving large-scale GOPs. The organic combination of the two algorithms with a certain strategy can improve the performance of the hybrid algorithm. Motivated by this idea, a hybrid global optimization algorithm based on DE and FPA is proposed. Firstly, an improved initial population generation method is provided for improving the quality of the initial population. Secondly, an improved DE is given, and the parameters F and CR are adjusted in an adaptive and dynamic fashion, and a combined mutation operator is designed. Thirdly, an improved FPA is proposed, and a method for adaptively and dynamically adjusting the switch probability p is given, and formulas for updating the global and local position are introduced. Lastly, a hybrid strategy of organically combining DE and FPA is proposed to form a hybrid algorithm of differential evolution and flower pollination (HADEFP). To demonstrate the performance of the hybrid algorithm, the proposed hybrid algorithm is tested against other algorithms in the literature on CEC 2017 test functions (10-D, 50-D and 100-D) and practical optimization problem, respectively. The results show that the proposed HADEFP outperforms other comparison algorithms and has better robustness.

AB Recent research efforts on Few-Shot Learning (FSL) have achieved extensive progress. However, the existing efforts primarily focus on the transductive setting of FSL, which is heavily challenged by the limited quantity of the unlabeled query set. Although a few inductive-based FSL methods have been studied, most of them emphasize learning superb feature extraction networks. As a result, they may ignore the relations between sample-level and class-level representations, which are particularly crucial when labeled samples are scarce. This paper proposes an inductive FSL framework that leverages the Hierarchical Knowledge Propagation and Distillation, named HKPD. To learn more discriminative sample-level representations, HKPD first constructs a sample-level information propagation module that explores pairwise sample relations. Subsequently, a class-level information propagation module is designed to obtain and update the class-level information. Moreover, a self-distillation module is adopted to further improve the learned representations by propagating the obtained knowledge across this hierarchical architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used few-shot benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HKPD method, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The infinite dilution activity coefficient (gamma infinity) is a crucial thermodynamic property that provides a measure of the affinity between the solute and the solvent. In this work, three deep learning models (deep neural network, convolution neural network, and convolution deep neural network) were proposed to predict the gamma infinity for ionic liquid-solute systems. 52 ionic liquids and 114 organic solutes (7783 data points in total) contained in the gamma infinity database over the temperature from 293.15 to 428.15 K were collected to construct the model. Molecular descriptor was generated using the RDKit. The Bayesian optimization algorithm was employed to determine the parameters for each model, and the stability of the model was increased by 10-fold cross validation. Finally, the method of SHapley Additive exPlanations was employed to explain our proposed model. The coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error, error, sum of squared error, relative root mean square error and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to assess the model. The results indicated that the experimental values were in satisfactory agreement with the values predicted for convolution deep neural network. These predictive models can be used to predict the gamma infinity for ionic liquid-solute systems to solve problems in phase equilibrium and process design.

AB During Basic screening, it is challenging, if not impossible to detect breast cancer especially in the earliest stage of tumor development. However, measuring the electrical impedance of biological tissue can detect abnormalities even before being palpable. Thus, we used impedance characteristics data of various breast tissue to develop a breast cancer screening tool guided and augmented by a deep learning (DL). A DL algorithm was trained to ideally classify six classes of breast cancer based on electrical impedance characteristics data of the breast tissue. The tool correctly predicted breast cancer in data of patients whose breast tissue impedance was reported to have been measured when other methods detected no anomaly in the tissue. Furthermore, a DL-based approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) effectively classified breast tissue with an accuracy of 96.67%. Thus, the DL algorithm and method we developed accurately augmented breast tissue classification using electrical impedance and enhanced the ability to detect and differentiate cancerous tissue in very early stages. However, more data and pre-clinical is required to improve the accuracy of this early breast cancer detection and differentiation tool.

AB The sliding sleeve holds a pivotal role in regulating fluid flow during hydraulic fracturing within shale oil extraction processes. However, concerns persist surrounding its reliability due to repeated attempts at opening the sleeve, resulting in process inefficiencies. While downhole cameras can verify sleeve states, their high cost poses a limitation. This study proposes an alternative approach, leveraging downhole data analysis for sleeve incident detection in lieu of cameras. This study introduces "XGSleeve," a novel machine-learning methodology. XGSleeve amalgamates hidden Markov model-based clustering with the XGBoost model, offering robust identification of sleeve incidents. This method serves as an operator-centric tool, addressing the domains of oil and gas, well completion, sliding sleeves, time series classification, signal processing, XGBoost, and hidden Markov models. The XGSleeve model exhibits a commendable 86% precision in detecting sleeve incidents. This outcome significantly curtails the need for multiple sleeve open-close attempts, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and safety. The successful implementation of the XGSleeve model rectifies existing limitations in sleeve incident detection, consequently fostering optimization, safety, and resilience within the oil and gas sector. This innovation further underscores the potential for data-driven decision-making in the industry. The XGSleeve model represents a groundbreaking advancement in sleeve incident detection, demonstrating the potential for broader integration of AI and machine learning in oil and gas operations. As technology advances, such methodologies are poised to optimize processes, minimize environmental impact, and promote sustainable practices. Ultimately, the adoption of XGSleeve contributes to the enduring growth and responsible management of global oil and gas resources.

AB This article focuses on online kernel learning over a decentralized network. Each agent in the network receives online streaming data and collaboratively learns a globally optimal nonlinear prediction function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). To overcome the curse of dimensionality issue in traditional online kernel learning, we utilize random feature (RF) mapping to convert the nonparametric kernel learning problem into a fixed-length parametric one in the RF space. We then propose a novel learning framework, named online decentralized kernel learning via linearized ADMM (ODKLA), to efficiently solve the online decentralized kernel learning problem. To enhance communication efficiency, we introduce quantization and censoring strategies in the communication stage, resulting in the quantized and communication-censored ODKLA (QC-ODKLA) algorithm. We theoretically prove that both ODKLA and QC-ODKLA can achieve the optimal sublinear regret O(vT) over T time slots. Through numerical experiments, we evaluate the learning effectiveness, communication efficiency, and computation efficiency of the proposed methods.

AB Water resource accounting constitutes a fundamental approach for implementing sophisticated management of basin water resources. The quality of water plays a pivotal role in determining the liabilities associated with these resources. Evaluating the quality of water facilitates the computation of water resource liabilities during the accounting process. Traditional accounting methods rely on manual sorting and data analysis, which necessitate significant human effort. In order to address this issue, we leverage the remarkable feature extraction capabilities of convolutional operations to construct neural networks. Moreover, we introduce the self-attention mechanism module to propose an unsupervised deep clustering method. This method offers assistance in accounting tasks by automatically classifying the debt levels of water resources in distinct regions, thereby facilitating comprehensive water resource accounting. The methodology presented in this article underwent verification using three datasets: the United States Postal Service (USPS), Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR), and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The evaluation of Accuracy rate (ACC), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metrics yielded favorable results, surpassing those of Kmeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Density-based constraint extension (DCE). Specifically, the mean values of the evaluation metrics across the three datasets were 0.8474, 0.7582, and 0.7295, respectively.

AB Multi-source domain generalization for person re-identification, named Domain Generalizable Person Re-Identification (DG-ReID), refers to training on multiple source domains and testing on unseen target domains. However, the performance of the current methods is rather unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Source Adaptive Meta-Learning (MAM) framework to push the limit of DG-ReID. First, MAM is built on the novel Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block, which simultaneously acquires domain-generalized features and domain-unique features on different domains. MAFR consists of three key components: the fine-grained feature extraction (FGFE) branch, the refined feature supplementation (RFS) branch, and the feature fusion (FF) module. Through these blocks, the interrelationships between different domains are explored, facilitating the extraction of features that are both generalized and discriminative. To capture domain-adaptive information, MAFR incorporates a meta-weight generator to effectively capture domain-adaptive information. Second, MAM leverages the principles of meta-learning during training to acquire more powerful generalization features. A total of three novel loss functions are proposed to train the proposed MAM including the clustering loss, the unknown domain identification loss, and the non-parametric identification loss. Last, we further design a novel meta-feature sampling method to diversify features used in the meta-testing stage for better generalization capability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, and the results provide comprehensive validation. For instance, our MAM framework presents a promising solution to the challenge of domain generalization in person re-identification. Specifically, under evaluation protocol-2, the MAM framework exhibits improvements of 1.0% and 0.9% in mAP and rank-1 metrics, respectively, compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.

AB In this article, a maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller is designed for photovoltaic (PV) applications. This controller has been implemented with Fuzzy Gain Scheduling of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) type controller (FGS-PID). To implement this controller, scaling factors (SF) for the input signals of FGS are applied. The recommended adaptive two-level controller has all the welfare of fuzzy logic system (FLC) and PID control. Zieglere-Nichols technique is used to fine-tune the initial PID's gains. The PID's gains are updated with FGS-PID in transient and steady-state conditions to cope with fluctuations, minimize settling time and ensure stability. FLC is used for gain factors to deal with tuning of conditioned input signals of the FGS-PID. Moreover, FLC and an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) are applied to tune the member functions (MFs) of FGS. The use of this algorithm can lead to automatic regulation of the triangular MFs. Simulations are done to confirm the edge of this approach over conventional methods. It is very fast and accurate in tracking the maximum power. It provides minimum oscillations and improved dynamic response than other approaches. The speed of the tracking is also improved with acceptable accuracy.

AB Local search methods play an important role in several approaches to solving complex optimization problems. However, black-box local search methods for continuous optimization problems tend to be excessively time-consuming and their performance typically deteriorates when dealing with large-scale problems. In this context, we propose the Gray-Box Local Search with Groups of Step Sizes (GBO-LSGSS) algorithm. GBO-LSGSS explores the problem structure through partial evaluations and subcomponents for improving its efficiency. Thus, this proposed method implements an orchestrator module to learn and select the most promissory subproblems. Overall, an experimental study revealed the competitive GBO-LSGSS performance even compared to some of the main algorithms for solving large-scale continuous problems. The comparison between GBO-LSGSS and its original version provides evidence that the proposed method can find better solutions and save up to 90% of processing time for fully and partially large-scale problems.

AB Human behavior recognition is one of the significant components of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and personal assistive robots allowing to improve the quality of their lives in terms of safety, autonomy, and well-being. A critical aspect of preventing dangerous situations for users, especially elderlies, is to recognize abnormal human behavior. In spite of the extensive exploration of abnormality recognition in various fields, there remain some challenges in developing effective approaches for recognizing abnormal human behaviors in AAL systems due to the limitations of data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches. In this paper, a context-aware framework combining data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches is proposed to better characterize human behaviors and recognize abnormal behaviors using commonsense reasoning while considering human behavior context. The proposed framework comprises five main modules, which leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Probabilistic Answer Set Programming (PASP)-based commonsense reasoning to recognize human activities and represent abnormal human behaviors, as well as reason about those behaviors. The proposed framework is evaluated using two datasets, namely Orange4Home and UCI HAR. The obtained results indicate the capability of the proposed framework to characterize human behaviors and recognize abnormal human behaviors with high performance.

AB Shortcut learning in deep learning models occurs when unintended features are prioritized, resulting in degenerated feature representations and reduced generalizability and interpretability. However, shortcut learning in the widely used vision transformer (ViT) framework is largely unknown. Meanwhile, introducing domain-specific knowledge is a major approach to rectifying the shortcuts that are predominated by background-related factors. For example, eye-gaze data from radiologists are effective human visual prior knowledge that has the great potential to guide the deep learning models to focus on meaningful foreground regions. However, obtaining eye-gaze data can still sometimes be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and even impractical. In this work, we propose a novel and effective saliency-guided ViT (SGT) model to rectify shortcut learning in ViT with the absence of eye-gaze data. Specifically, a computational visual saliency model (either pretrained or fine-tuned) is adopted to predict saliency maps for input image samples. Then, the saliency maps are used to filter the most informative image patches. Considering that this filter operation may lead to global information loss, we further introduce a residual connection that calculates the self-attention across all the image patches. The experiment results on natural and medical image datasets show that our SGT framework can effectively learn and leverage human prior knowledge without eye-gaze data and achieves much better performance than baselines. Meanwhile, it successfully rectifies the harmful shortcut learning and significantly improves the interpretability of the ViT model, demonstrating the promise of transferring human prior knowledge derived visual saliency in rectifying shortcut learning.

AB The massive memory accesses of feature maps (FMs) in deep neural network (DNN) processors lead to huge power consumption, which becomes a major energy bottleneck of DNN accelerators. In this article, we propose a unified framework named Transform and Entropy-based COmpression (TECO) scheme to efficiently compress FMs with various attributes in DNN inference. We explore, for the first time, the intrinsic unimodal distribution characteristic that widely exists in the frequency domain of various FMs. In addition, a well-optimized hardware-friendly coding scheme is designed, which fully utilizes this remarkable data distribution characteristic to encode and compress the frequency spectrum of different FMs. Furthermore, the information entropy theory is leveraged to develop a novel loss function for improving the compression ratio and to make a fast comparison among different compressors. Extensive experiments are performed on multiple tasks and demonstrate that the proposed TECO achieves compression ratios of 2.31 $\times$ in ResNet-50 on image classification, 3.47 $\times$ in UNet on dark image enhancement, and 3.18 $\times$ in Yolo-v4 on object detection while keeping the accuracy of these models. Compared with the upper limit of the compression ratio for original FMs, the proposed framework achieves the compression ratio improvement of 21%, 157%, and 152% on the above models.

AB We present in this paper a novel solution for assisting users in formulating SPARQL queries. The high-level idea is that users write "semi-formal SPARQL queries," namely queries whose structure resembles SPARQL but are not necessarily grounded to the schema of the underlying knowledge graph and require only basic familiarity with SPARQL. This means that the user-intended query over the knowledge graph may differ from the specified semi-formal query in its structure and query elements. We design a novel framework that systematically and gradually refines the query to obtain candidate formal queries that do match the knowledge graph. Crucially, we introduce a formal notion of provenance tracking this query refinement process and use the tracked provenance to prompt the user for fine-grained feedback on parts of the candidate query, guiding our search. Experiments on a diverse query workload with respect to both DBpedia and YAGO show the usefulness of our approach.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with bilevel surrogate modeling, called BL-SAEA, for tackling bilevel optimization problems (BLOPs), in which an upper level problem is to be solved subject to the optimality of a corresponding lower level problem. The motivation of this article is that the extensive lower level optimization required by each upper level solution consumes too many function evaluations, leading to poor optimization performance of EAs. To this end, during the upper level optimization, the BL-SAEA builds an upper level surrogate model to select several promising upper level solutions for the lower level optimization. Because only a small number of upper level solutions require the lower level optimization, the number of function evaluations can be considerably reduced. During the lower level optimization, the BL-SAEA constructs multiple lower level surrogate models to initialize the population of the lower level optimization, thus further decreasing the number of function evaluations. Experimental results on two widely used benchmarks and two real-world BLOPs demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over six state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

AB This article studies the visual servoing and vibration suppression control for flexible manipulators when the system states are unmeasurable and only the image feedback is available. The dynamic equations of flexible manipulators are decomposed into the slow and fast subsystems based on the singular perturbation theory. The nonlinear observers based on the state transformation using the Lie derivatives are proposed to estimate the unmeasurable system states and unknown camera intrinsic parameters at the same time. Then, the image-based controllers utilizing the estimated states are, respectively, designed in the slow and fast subsystems to regulate the image positions of feature points and suppress the vibration of flexible manipulators simultaneously. In the proposed approach, only the visual feedback is required to generate the control input for flexible manipulators, which simplifies the controller implementation. The stability of the proposed control scheme is proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, experimental results on a flexible single-link manipulator are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

TI Observer-Based Adaptive NN Security Control for Switched Nonlinear
   Systems Against DoS Attacks: An ADT Approach

AB In this article, a novel switched observer-based neural network (NN) adaptive control algorithm is established, which addresses the security control problem of switched nonlinear systems (SNSs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered SNSs are described in lower triangular form with external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. Note that when an attack is launched in the sensor-controller channel, the controller will not receive any message, which makes the standard backstepping controller not workable. To tackle the challenge, a set of NN adaptive observers are designed under two different situations, which can switch adaptively depending on the DoS attack on/off. Further, an NN adaptive controller is constructed and the dynamic surface control method is borrowed to surmount the complexity explosion phenomenon. To eliminate double damage from DoS attacks and switches, a set of switching laws with average dwell time are designed via the multiple Lyapunov function method, which in combination with the proposed controllers, guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, an illustrative example is offered to verify the availability of the proposed control algorithm.

AB High-frequency trading proposes new challenges to classical portfolio selection problems. Especially, the timely and accurate solution of portfolios is highly demanded in financial market nowadays. This article makes progress along this direction by proposing novel neural networks with softmax equalization to address the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that softmax technique is used to deal with equation constraints in portfolio selections. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method is globally convergent to the optimum of the optimization formulation of portfolio selection. Experiments based on real stock data verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution. It is worth mentioning that the two proposed models achieve 5.50% and 5.47% less cost, respectively, than the solution obtained by using MATLAB dedicated solvers, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategies.

AB Color-tone represents the prominent color of an image, and training generative adversarial nets (GAN) to change color-tones of generated images is desirable in many applications. Advances such as HistoGAN can manipulate color-tones of generated images with a target image. Yet, there are challenges. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence adopted by HistoGAN might bring the color-tone mismatching, because it is possible to provide infinite score to a generator. Moreover, only relying on distribution estimation also produces images with lower fidelity in HistoGAN. To address these issues, we propose a new approach, named dynamic weights GAN (DW-GAN). We use two discriminators to estimate the distribution matching degree and details' similarity, with Laplacian operator and Hinge loss. Laplacian operator can help capture more image details, while Hinge loss is deduced from mean difference (MD) that could avoid the case of infinite score. To synthesize desired images, we combine the loss of the two discriminators with generator loss and set the weights of the two estimated scores to be dynamic through the previous discriminators' outputs, given that the training signal of a generator is from a discriminator. Besides, we innovatively integrate the dynamic weights into other GAN variants (e.g., HistoGAN and StyleGAN) to show the improved performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on one industrial Fabric and seven public datasets to demonstrate the significant performance of DW-GAN in producing higher fidelity images and achieving the lowest Frechet inception distance (FID) scores over SOTA baselines.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved encouraging progress in modeling human body skeletons as spatial-temporal graphs. However, existing methods still suffer from two inherent drawbacks. Firstly, these models process the input data based on the physical structure of the human body, which leads to some latent correlations among joints being ignored. Furthermore, the key temporal relationships between nonadjacent frames are overlooked, preventing to fully learn the changes of the body joints along the temporal dimension. To address these issues, we propose an innovative spatial-temporal model by introducing a self-adaptive GCN (SAGCN) with global attention network, collectively termed SAGGAN. Specifically, the SAGCN module is proposed to construct two additional dynamic topological graphs to learn the common characteristics of all data and represent a unique pattern for each sample, respectively. Meanwhile, the global attention module (spatial attention (SA) and temporal attention (TA) modules) is designed to extract the global connections between different joints in a single frame and model temporal relationships between adjacent and nonadjacent frames in temporal sequences. In this manner, our network can capture richer features of actions for accurate action recognition and overcome the defect of the standard graph convolution. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NTU-60, NTU-120, and Kinetics) have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method.

AB This work investigates formal generalization error bounds that apply to support vector machines (SVMs) in realizable and agnostic learning problems. We focus on recently observed parallels between probably approximately correct (PAC)-learning bounds, such as compression and complexity-based bounds, and novel error guarantees derived within scenario theory. Scenario theory provides nonasymptotic and distributional-free error bounds for models trained by solving data-driven decision-making problems. Relevant theorems and assumptions are reviewed and discussed. We propose a numerical comparison of the tightness and effectiveness of theoretical error bounds for support vector classifiers trained on several randomized experiments from 13 real-life problems. This analysis allows for a fair comparison of different approaches from both conceptual and experimental standpoints. Based on the numerical results, we argue that the error guarantees derived from scenario theory are often tighter for realizable problems and always yield informative results, i.e., probability bounds tighter than a vacuous $[0,1]$ interval. This work promotes scenario theory as an alternative tool for model selection, structural-risk minimization, and generalization error analysis of SVMs. In this way, we hope to bring the communities of scenario and statistical learning theory closer, so that they can benefit from each other's insights.

AB This article proposes a model-free kinematic control method with predefined-time convergence for robotic manipulators with unknown models. The predefined-time convergence property guarantees that the regulation task can be finished by robotic manipulators in a preset time, in spite of the initial state of manipulators. This feature will facilitate the scheduling of a series of tasks in industrial applications. To this end, a varying-parameter predefined-time convergent zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) model is first proposed and employed to solve the regulation problem. As well as the primary task, a conventional ZND model is utilized to achieve the avoidance of obstacle. The stability of the proposed controller is analyzed based on the Lyapunov stability theory. For the sake of dealing with the unknown kinematic model of robotic manipulators, gradient neural dynamics (GND) models are exploited to adapt the Jacobian matrices just relying on the control signal and sensory output, which enables us to control robotic manipulators in a model-free manner. Finally, the efficacy and merits of the proposed control method are verified by simulations and experiments, including a comparison with the existing method.

AB This article holds that governmental investments in quantum technologies speak to the imaginable futures of digital sovereignty and digital infrastructures, two major areas of change driven by related technologies like AI and Big Data, among other things, in international law today. Under intense development today for future interpolation into digital systems that they may alter, quantum technologies occupy a sort of liminal position, rooted in existing assemblages of computational technologies while pointing to new horizons for them. The possibilities they raise are neither certain nor determinate, but active investments in them (legal, political and material investments) offer perspective on digital technology-driven influences on an international legal imagination. In contributing to visions of the future that are guiding ambitions for digital sovereignty and digital infrastructures, quantum technologies condition digital technology-driven changes to international law and legal imagination in the present. Privileging observation and description, I adapt and utilize a diffractive method with the aim to discern what emerges out of the interference among the several related things assembled for this article, including material technologies and legal institutions. In conclusion, I observe ambivalent changes to an international legal imagination, changes which promise transformation but appear nonetheless to reproduce current distributions of power and resources.

AB Social media has revolutionized the way information is distributed throughout society, as folks continue to rely entirely on these apps for information on current events, health protocols, and socio-political discussions. However, these containers of knowledge do not appear in the same shape for every user; Algorithms, informed by capitalist agendas, determine what information sifts through its networks and to whom. Data scientists, researchers, and activists have dissected the hidden mechanics fueling these popular platforms, inciting critical conversations around the harmful biases embedded in algorithms. These studies often skim the surface of how these algorithms digitally marginalize people of color, if acknowledging it at all. Even fewer have attempted to examine the role these algorithms play in the social activism and digital community organizing happening amongst communities of color via social media. Referring to indigenous scholar Marisa Elena Duarte's book Network Sovereignty as a framework of thought, this paper roots itself in the notion that technology is an extension of the agenda utilizing it. Through dissecting the algorithmic structures of popular social platforms among communities of color, this paper examines how social media distributes information within its networks and how its encoded biases silence Black, brown, and indigenous voices. This paper also provides insight into how BIPOC content-creators, when informed on how the algorithms work, can use these platforms to their advantage and effectively facilitate socio-political discourse online; Changing the narrative of social networks from being yet another landscape of white supremacy to instead a communal canvas for radical change.

DE Recommender system; multi-behavior; dynamic preference; graph neural
   network; gated recurrent unit
AB Multi-behavior recommendation has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to outperform single-behavior models. Current research related to multi-behavior models leaves room for improvement in the following two areas. First, the noise carried by individual behaviors and the additional noise generated during behavior processing is often overlooked, and these can ultimately degrade recommendation performance. Second, the specific time period of behavioral interactions and the frequency of interactions within that time period are also not taken into account. To address the above limitations, we propose a multi-behavior recommendation model integrating dynamic preferences (MB-DP) that captures dynamic interests while smoothing and denoising multi-behavior information. MB-DP extracts low and high-order semantics from various behaviors and unifies the measurements to generate interaction predictions. Additionally, it analyzes the interaction time and frequency of each behavior using gated recurrent units to capture the dynamic preferences of users and improve the prediction values. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets show that MB-DP significantly improves recommendation performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Competitive Intelligence allows an organization to keep up with market trends and foresee business opportunities. This practice is mainly performed by analysts scanning for any piece of valuable information in a myriad of dispersed and unstructured sources. Here we present MapIntel, a system for acquiring intelligence from vast collections of text data by representing each document as a multidimensional vector that captures its own semantics. The system is designed to handle complex Natural Language queries and visual exploration of the corpus, potentially aiding overburdened analysts in finding meaningful insights to help decision-making. The system searching module uses a retriever and re-ranker engine that first finds the closest neighbours to the query embedding and then sifts the results through a cross-encoder model that identifies the most relevant documents. The browsing or visualization module also leverages the embeddings by projecting them onto two dimensions while preserving the multidimensional landscape, resulting in a map where semantically related documents form topical clusters which we capture using topic modelling. This map aims at promoting a fast overview of the corpus while allowing a more detailed exploration and interactive information encountering process. We evaluate the system and its components on the 20 newsgroups data set, using the semantic document labels provided, and demonstrate the superiority of Transformer-based components. Finally, we present a prototype of the system in Python and show how some of its features can be used to acquire intelligence from a news article corpus we collected during a period of 8 months.

AB This article addresses the synchronization tracking problem for high-order uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems via intermittent feedback under a directed graph. By resorting to a novel storer-based triggering transmission strategy in the state channels, we propose an event-triggered neuroadaptive control method with quantitative state feedback that exhibits several salient features: 1) avoiding continuous control updates by making the parameter estimations updated intermittently at the trigger instants; 2) resulting in lower-frequency triggering transmissions by using one event detector to monitor the triggering condition such that each agent only needs to broadcast information at its own trigger times; and 3) saving communication and computation resources by designing the intermittent updating of neural network weights using a dual-phase technique during the triggering period. Besides, it is shown that the proposed scheme is capable of steering the tracking/disagreement errors into an adjustable neighborhood close to the origin, and the existence of a strictly positive dwell time is proved to circumvent Zeno behavior. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation authenticate and validate the efficiency of the proposed protocols.

AB In real-world applications, robotic systems collect vast amounts of new data from ever-changing environments over time. They need to continually interact and learn new knowledge from the external world to adapt to the environment. Particularly, lifelong object recognition in an online and interactive manner is a crucial and fundamental capability for robotic systems. To meet this realistic demand, in this article, we propose an online active continual learning (OACL) framework for robotic lifelong object recognition, in the scenario of both classes and domains changing with dynamic environments. First, to reduce the labeling cost as much as possible while maximizing the performance, a new online active learning (OAL) strategy is designed by taking both the uncertainty and diversity of samples into account to protect the information volume and distribution of data. In addition, to prevent catastrophic forgetting and reduce memory costs, a novel online continual learning (OCL) algorithm is proposed based on the deep feature semantic augmentation and a new loss-based deep model and replay buffer update, which can mitigate the class imbalance between the old and new classes and alleviate confusion between two similar classes. Moreover, the mistake bound of the proposed method is analyzed in theory. OACL allows robots to select the most representative new samples to query labels and continually learn new objects and new variants of previously learned objects from a nonindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data stream without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on real lifelong robotic vision datasets demonstrate that our algorithm, even trained with fewer labeled samples and replay exemplars, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on OCL tasks.

In order to protect the privacy and ensure the security of image transmission, the synchronization results are utilized in the image cryptosystem to achieve compression and encryption. First, the driving chaos system is coupled with multiple local systems and synchronized with the transmitted encrypted signals. Second, the Boolean network is driven and synchronized with derived chaos signals. Finally, images are encrypted and compressed with chaos-driven Boolean network signals in the transmitter, and then decrypted and recovered with synchronized chaos and Boolean network signals in the recipient. Because of the complexities of high dimensional chaos and Boolean network, the proposed cryptosystem has good security in the secure communication and image process.

AB This paper aims to address the problem of supervised monocular depth estimation. We start with a meticulous pilot study to demonstrate that the long-range correlation is essential for accurate depth estimation. Moreover, the Transformer and convolution are good at long-range and close-range depth estimation, respectively. Therefore, we propose to adopt a parallel encoder architecture consisting of a Transformer branch and a convolution branch. The former can model global context with the effective attention mechanism and the latter aims to preserve the local information as the Transformer lacks the spatial inductive bias in modeling such contents. However, independent branches lead to a shortage of connections between features. To bridge this gap, we design a hierarchical aggregation and heterogeneous interaction module to enhance the Transformer features and model the affinity between the heterogeneous features in a set-to-set translation manner. Due to the unbearable memory cost introduced by the global attention on high-resolution feature maps, we adopt the deformable scheme to reduce the complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, NYU, and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our proposed model, termed DepthFormer, surpasses state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods with prominent margins. The effectiveness of each proposed module is elaborately evaluated through meticulous and intensive ablation studies.

AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) facilitate communication between the brain and external devices, providing an alternative solution for individuals with upper limb disabilities. The decoding of brain movement commands in BCIs relies on signal feature extraction and classification. Herein, the BNCI Horizon 2020 dataset is employed, which consists of electroencephalographic signals from ten participants with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injuries. These participants perform or attempt five distinct types of arm and hand movements. To extract signal features, a novel technique is introduced that estimates movement-related cortical potentials and incorporates them into the processing pipeline. Moreover, a time-frequency domain representation of the dataset is used as input for the classifier. Given the promising outcomes demonstrated by deep learning models in BCI classification, a pretrained ConvNet AlexNet is adopted to decode the motor tasks. The proposed method exhibits a remarkable average accuracy of 76.0% across all five categories, representing a significant advancement over existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of the convolutional layers in the model is conducted to gain comprehensive insights into the classification process. By examining the ConvNet filters and activations, the method contributes to a deeper understanding of the electrophysiology that underlies attempted movement.

DE Blind image deblurring; Dynamic-clustering extreme intensity prior; FCM
ID SINGLE IMAGE; DECONVOLUTION
AB In blind image deblurring, feasible solutions have been obtained by exploiting image prior information such as dark channel prior, extreme channel prior, and local minimal intensity prior. The performance highly depends on these priors, which may have poor adaptability to different image contents in real-world applications. For example, these priors only consider the changes in local minimal and maximal intensity pixels in the blurring process and ignore the difference between these changes. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image deblurring approach based on dynamic-clustering extreme intensity prior. Specifically, the patch-wise maximal pixels (PMaxP) prior and patch-wise minimal pixels (PMinP) prior are employed and clustered into two by applying fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. The regularizations impose the sparsity inducing on either PMaxP prior or PMinP prior in each patch. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms on synthetic and real-world images.

AB Feedback is essential for athletes in order to improve their sport performance. Feedback systems try to provide athletes and coaches not only with visualisations of acquired data, but moreover, with insights into-possibly-invisible aspects of their performance. With the widespread adoption of smartphones and the increase in their capabilities, their use as a device for applications of feedback systems is becoming increasingly popular. However, developing mobile feedback systems requires a high level of expertise from researchers and practitioners. The Direct Mobile Coaching model is a design-paradigm for mobile feedback systems. In order to reduce programming efforts, PEGASOS, a framework for creating feedback systems implementing the so-called Direct Mobile Coaching model, is introduced. The paper compares this framework with state-of-the-art research with regard to their ability of providing different variants feedback and offering multimodality to users.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global public health concern since March 11, 2020. Healthcare systems struggled to meet patients' growing needs for diagnosis, treatment, and care. As healthcare industries struggled to cope with the overwhelming demands, advanced intelligence and computing technologies have become essential. Artificial intelligence techniques have become essential for identifying and triaging patients, predicting disease severity, and detecting outcomes. The aim of the paper is to propose a gradient boosting-based model to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients and to improve the prediction accuracy by incorporating resampling strategies. A real COVID-19 data that includes patients' travel, health, geographical, and demographic information is obtained from a public repository. The dataset used in the study has the class imbalance problem, and several approaches are applied to solve the problem. In this study, a gradient boosting-based model for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients is proposed. This approach incorporates resampling strategies, such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random under-sampling, and clustering-based under-sampling, to address the imbalanced class distribution problem in the dataset. Then, gradient boosting machines (GBM) such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) are analyzed in terms of accuracy and computational time. Random search method is used to find the optimal hyper-parameters for the algorithms. A stacking-based hybrid model that combines the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms was used for comparison in the experiments. In the experiments, the factors that can influence the mortality of COVID-19 patients are investigated. And, it is found that the age of the patient, whether the patient belonged to Wuhan, the difference between when they first noticed symptoms and when they visited the hospital (in days) affect the mortality. By utilizing over/under-sampling approaches, we ameliorated the concern of class imbalance. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are effectively analyzed in terms of various performance metrics to determine the suitable GBM for the proposed system. The experimental results revealed that the stacking-based hybrid model performs well with the balanced dataset provided by SMOTE. CatBoost produces superior results for a balanced dataset with random under-sampling and clustering-based under-sampling. The main focus of the study is to propose a gradient boosting-based model for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients. This study also emphasizes the importance of addressing the imbalanced class distribution problem in the dataset and incorporates resampling strategies to improve the prediction accuracy. Our promising result confirms the success of the proposed system in predicting mortality of COVID-19 disease.

AB Retinex decomposition is a prevalent solution to low-light image enhancement. It is usually considered as a constrained optimization problem. To improve enhancement performance, the Retinex model is incorporated with various prior constraints, which make the optimization process complicated and difficult. In this paper, a method of low-light enhancement with regularized Gaussian Fields (RGF) model is proposed to address this issue. Firstly, we construct an RGF-based optimization model to formulate simultaneous reflectance and illumination estimation as an unconstrained optimization problem. Therefore, Retinex decomposition in RGF model can be solved by gradient descent techniques and has superiority on computational convenience. Then, to suppress noise and preserve detail in the estimated reflectance, the detail-preserving model based on Gaussian total variation (GTV) is established. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons on several public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-arts in terms of enhancement efficiency and quality.

ID SINGLE-IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION
AB Single-image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction has highly academic and practical values. The deep plug-and-play super-resolution (DPSR) framework has been proposed to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) images with arbitrary blur kernels. However, DPSR does not make full use of hierarchical features from original LR images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance, such as getting low average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) values. Considering residual-in-residual dense block (RRDB) can exploit hierarchical features, in this paper, firstly, RRDB is introduced to design an improved DPSR (IDPSR) framework with RRDB for arbitrary blur kernels. Secondly, the RRDB is adopted to replace the deep feature extraction part in DPSR in order to extract abundant local features, which makes the network capacity higher benefiting from the dense connections. The residual learning in different levels in RRDB can obtain high quality images. Finally, the test experiments are based on Set5, Set14, Urban100 and BSD100 datasets. The experimental results show that, under different blur kernels and different scale factors, PSNR and SSIM values of our proposed method increase by 0.34dB and 0.68%, respectively; under different noise levels, the average PSNR and SSIM values increase by 0.27dB and 1.01%, respectively.

AB Aiming at the shortcomings of Chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), which is easy to fall into local optimal value and imbalance between global exploration ability and local exploitation ability. To improve ChOA from the perspective of multi-strategy mixing, MSChimp was proposed, and the algorithm was applied to global optimization and minimum spanning tree problems. The main research work of this paper is as follows: (1) In the initialization stage of ChOA, an opposition-based learning strategy was introduced to improve the population diversity; Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) was introduced in the exploitation process to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm in the later stage, so as to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. (2) The improved algorithm was compared with different types of meta-heuristic algorithms in 20 benchmark functions and CEC 2019 test sets, and was used to solve the minimum spanning tree. The experimental results show that the improved ChOA has significantly improved the ability to find the optimal value, which verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of MSChimp. Compared with other algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper has strong competitiveness.

TI PF-BERxiT: Early exiting for BERT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning
   and flexible early exiting strategy
SO NEUROCOMPUTING

DE Parameter-efficient; Flexible early exiting; Fine-tuning; BERxiT
AB The industrial usage of huge pre-training language models such as BERT and ALBERT are limited by the computational probability problem in the fine-tuning process and overthinking problem in the inference process. PF-BERxiT has been proposed to optimize the pre-trained languages with a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method and a flexible early exiting strategy. Significantly, the new parameter-efficient fine-tuning model integrates a bottleneck adapter architecture parallel to the transformer architecture, and only the adapter's parameters are adjusted. In addition, we integrate an extra sub-learning module to learn the samples' characteristics, improving the accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. The flexible exiting strategy allows the model to exit early if the similarity score of adjacent layers is less than the threshold for pre-defined times. It is more flexible than previous early exiting methods, for it can simultaneously adjust the similarity score thresholds and patience parameters according to the request traffic. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GLUE benchmark, demonstrating that: (1) PF-BERxiT outperforms conventional training and parameter-efficient strategies with only a few parameters fine-tuned. (2) PF-BERxiT strikes a better balance between model performances and speedup ratios than previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) early exiting methods such as PABEE and BERxiT. (3) Ablation studies in the fine-tuning process demonstrate that the best bottleneck dimension r of the adapters is 32, and the adapters placed parallel to the feed-forward module are more efficient. (4) Ablation studies in the inference process demonstrate that for variants of PF-BERxiT with different similarity scores, PFBERxiT-kl and PF-BERxiT-bikl attain better speedup-accuracy trade-offs than PF-BERxiT-rekl. Our PF-BERxiT helps attain a better trade-off between performance and efficiency, providing a reference for the efficient application of neural computing.

AB The scheduling of operations in a large hospital is performed jointly by several groups of people, each with its own objective and constraints. It is a two-phase process, starting with the allocation of operating rooms to wards, and followed by the scheduling of operations in each operating room of the hospital on each day. The final schedule must satisfy all inter-ward hard constraints, such as the allocation of anesthetists, nurses, and equipment to operations that are taking place in parallel, and ideally, it should also address soft constraints such as taking the urgency and complexity of operations into consideration.
   This study contributes to the ongoing effort of adapting multi-agent optimization models and algorithms to real-world applications by modeling the problems in both phases as distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs), with different properties. The first phase includes partially cooperative ward-representing agents, allocating operating rooms for daily usage among themselves. In the second phase, ward-representing agents interact with agents representing constraining elements, in order to generate daily operation schedules for each operating room, thus forming a unique bipartite constraint graph. On one side are the ward representatives, while on the other are the agents representing the constraining resources. Each agent has a non-trivial local problem to solve, and its solution serves as the proposed assignment in the distributed algorithm.
   The study begins by discussing the properties required of the algorithms needed to solve the two phases. It then proposes adjustments to existing distributed partially cooperative algorithms and local search algorithms to solve these problems, and compares the results of different variants of these algorithms. The results obtained for both phases emphasize that successful collaboration is predicated on two requirements: that agents hold consistent information regarding their peers' states and that the degree of exploration undertaken by the algorithm is restricted in order to produce high-quality solutions.

   decomposition; Time perspective
AB Facts in the real world are often tied to time, such as the spread of diseases, and the state of military affairs. Therefore, knowledge graphs combined with temporal factors have gained growing attention. In the temporal knowledge graph, most researchers focus on the original facts and pay attention to their changes over time. The temporal factors are only used as auxiliary information for representation learning. In this paper, we try to observe from the perspective of time and find some interesting properties of temporal knowledge graph: (1) Simultaneousness. Various facts occur at the same time; (2) Aggregation. The facts may aggregately occur for a certain individual, organization, or location; (3) Associativity. Some specific relations tend to occur at specific times, such as celebrations at festivals. Based on the above three properties, we add a simple time-aware module to the existing tensor decomposition-based temporal knowledge graph model TComplEx (Lacroix et al., 2020), which obtains impressive improvements and achieves state-of-the-art results on four standard temporal knowledge graph completion benchmarks. Specifically, in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), we advance the state-of-the-art by +24.0% on ICEWS14, +13.2% on ICEWS05-15, +31.9% on YAGO15k, and 4.7% on GDELT.

ID MODEL; EVOLUTION
AB As an essential indicator of the structural health status of dams, saturation lines are often utilized to reflect the safety of tailings ponds. Effective monitoring of saturation lines during mining operations can significantly reduce the risk of tailings pond failure. However, the existing mathematical models based on shallow machine learning-driven methods are greatly limited in their ability to capture complex time series information. Moreover, these models only capture spatial dependencies but neglect channel adaptability when dealing with 1-D raw data sequences. To address this issue, we propose a channel and spatial-wise attention model to extract both rich visual patterns and time series dependence in the encoded images. Specifically, our model employs a novel two-stage prediction method. Firstly, after capturing refined stable trend characteristics using discrete wavelet transform, we encode the time series saturation line data into 32 x 32 x 3 RGB images. Secondly, to further capture visual patterns, channel-wise information is detected using features from different channels in each block of our backbone. The performance of our proposed model is demonstrated to outperform four other state-of-the-art deep neural networks on six real-world datasets of saturation lines.

AB Amidst the rapid propagation of images across social media platforms, the representation learning of social images has emerged as a prime research pursuit. A salient characteristic of social images lies in their multimodal properties, encompassing the visual content and textual descriptions present within individual images and the social relationships among different images. Notably, the content information within individual images and the structural information among different images exhibit a hierarchical nature. However, existing endeavors generally employ a flat framework, leading to suboptimal utilization of hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, the heterogeneity inherent in data content and structural information presents additional challenges in social image representation. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model for Social Image Representation learning, dubbed HHGSI. Our motivation lies in exploring and exploiting the hierarchical relationship between diverse modalities through designing the hierarchical heterogeneous network framework. HHGSI consists of an Intra-node Multimodal Graph Encoder and an Inter-node Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to simultaneously capture fine-grained correlation within the image and heterogeneous relationships among the images. Moreover, a task-independent optimization objective is designed to make the model suitable for numerous network-oriented and multimodal tasks. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over four real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/multimodal-code/HHGSI.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Dynamic loads on engineering structures are often difficult to measure directly. Therefore, indirect identification methods based on dynamic responses are commonly used. However, this approach is often influenced by ill-conditioned matrices, noise interference, unknown structural and/or material parameters, and difficulty of constructing transfer functions when the traditional physics-based model is used. To address these issues, significant strides have been made in data-driven identification of dynamic loads, which are model-free and in-dependent of structural characteristics. This paper tries to present a comprehensive review of dynamic load identification methods based on data-driven techniques, covering two aspects: load localization and load reconstruction. Features of the widely used data-driven techniques such as the geometric method, reference database method, machine learning methods including SVM-based methods and ANN-based methods and deep learning methods are discussed in detail. Additionally, this paper offers insight into the challenges and prospects of the data-driven techniques for dynamic load identification. The review aims to provide valuable insights for identifying dynamic loads in complex structures based on data-driven techniques and suggests future research directions.

AB The fan noise in the train electric traction system contributes to the main noise of the train, affecting the comfort of the passengers. The prediction of fan noise can serve as a foundation for the design and fault diagnosis of the fan in the train electric traction system as well as noise reduction. This paper proposes a prediction model based on multiple regression analysis and a double-layer fuzzy neural network (MRA-2LFNN). After the multiple regression analysis of the train electric traction system fan noise is performed to determine the prediction input, a fuzzy neural network is used to predict the fan noise. Afterward, further analysis of noise influencing factors is presented based on the experimental results, and the possibility of the fan optimal design is discussed. This method can make accurate predictions using a small sample of fan noise data, reducing the need for data samples and lowering costs. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better prediction results using the small sample dataset by training and verifying the actual train electric traction system fan noise data, and the average prediction accuracy rate is 94.15%, After discussion, when the number of fan blades is 16, the train electric traction system exhibits improved noise performance.

Renewable energy, thus, has a crucial effect on accomplishing these policies. To ensure a rapid spread of renewable energy and develop resilient renewable energy policies concerning the evaluation of renewable energy resources, socio-political factors should be considered. However, evaluating renewable energy technologies regarding the socio-political aspect is clearly more difficult and uncertain than a study focused only on quantifiable objectives, but it is critical since real projects are affected by such aspects. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are best for addressing such issues with conflicting objectives. In this study, an integrated AHP-TOPSIS method with Py-thagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) was used to create the socio-political index for evaluating renewable energy hybrid technologies and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in Turkey. The results showed that while solar energy has the highest socio-political index, Run of River with BESSs alternative ranks as the lowest.

AB This study investigates the role of a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm on machinability (cutting force) and surface roughness of nano zinc oxide embedded glass fiber reinforced polymer composites (nZnO-GFRPC). A hybrid grey theory-white shark optimizer (Grey-WSO) algorithm is developed where grey theory combines output responses (surface roughness and cutting force) into a single objective function, and white shark is used to find the optimal responses. The novelty of the developed method is the compatibility of two different varieties of machine learning algorithms into one and the combination of two different responses, i.e., cutting force and surface roughness, into a single objective function. The influence of parameters, i.e., nanoparticles amount, fiber volume fraction and feed rate, is designed by Taguchi orthogonal array and their optimization is performed by Grey-WSO. The optimal results are achieved with 1 % ZnO (Weight %), 75 mm/min feed rate and 6.031 % fiber volume fraction, respectively. The optimum cutting force and surface roughness results were 197.64 N and 1.6765 mu m, respectively. The validation of results shows that the output performance improved from 0.9414 to 0.9514, indicating the performance of the developed Grey-WSO with a 1.06% error. The developed algorithm was compared with other metaheuristics algorithms to demonstrate its potential to adopt in cutting, milling, shaping and other machining characteristics of composite materials. The results also confirm that nanoparticles amount is a highly influencing factor for surface roughness calculations.

AB As the importance of machine learning tools for decision support continues to grow, interpretability has emerged as a key factor. Rule-based classification algorithms, such as decision trees and rule induction, enable high local interpretability by providing transparent reasoning rules in an IF-THEN format. In this context, it is essential to provide concise and clear rules and conditions to achieve high local interpretability. This study proposes a novel Concise Algorithm, designed to effectively remove irrelevant conditions from classification rules. We present a framework incorporating the Concise Algorithm, which employs the One-Sided-Maximum decision tree algorithm for rule generation, followed by the application of the Concise Algorithm to remove irrelevant conditions. This proposed framework produces a rule-based classification model that exhibits an enhanced predictive performance-interpretability trade-off compared to benchmark methods (CART, Ripper, CN2, and modified One-Sided-Maximum), as demonstrated by empirical tests conducted on 19 UCI datasets. A case study focusing on the breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of the rule and condition generation processes.

AB It has been reported that integrating time-series decomposition methods and neural network models improves financial time-series prediction performance. Despite its practical importance, the prediction performance of cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin, at the tail domain of the label distribution is generally less successful than the mean performance across the entire domain of the label distribution. In order to enhance the overall predictive performance of the Bitcoin price, we propose the Centralized Clusters Distribution (CCD) as a novel input data filtering mechanism that significantly improves both the tail performance and the overall performance by mitigating the extreme bimodality inherent in Bitcoin price. The combination of CCD and the Weighted Empirical Stretching (WES) loss function, which imposes different penalties depending on the label distribution, outcomes in an additional performance gain. In the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) decomposition method, the CCD-WES strategy outperforms the native experiment by 11.5% and 22.5% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) gain in the whole and extreme domains of the label, respectively.

AB Tucker decomposition is used extensively for modeling multi-dimensional data represented as tensors. Owing to the increasing magnitude of nonzero values in real-world tensors, a growing demand has emerged for expeditious and scalable Tucker decomposition techniques. Several graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated techniques have been proposed for Tucker decomposition to decrease the decomposition speed. However, these approaches often encounter difficulties in handling extensive tensors owing to their huge memory demands, which exceed the available capacity of GPU memory. This study presents an expandable GPU-based technique for Tucker decomposition called GPUTucker. The proposed method meticulously partitions sizable tensors into smaller sub-tensors, which are referred to as tensor blocks, and effectively implements the GPU-based data pipeline by handling these tensor blocks asynchronously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPUTucker outperforms state-of-the-art Tucker decomposition methods in terms of the decomposition speed and scalability.

AB Variable selection is a procedure to obtain truly important predictors from inputs. Complex nonlinear dependencies and strong coupling pose great challenges for variable selection in high-dimensional data. Real world applications have increased the demand for interpretable selection processes. A pragmatic approach should not only yield the most predictive covariates but also provide ample and easy-to-understand reasons for removing certain covariates. In view of these requirements, this paper proposes an approach for transparent and nonlinear variable selection. To transparently decouple information within the input predictors, a three step heuristic search is designed, by which the input predictors are grouped into four subsets: relevant predictors, which are selected, and uninformative, redundant, and conditionally independent predictors, which are removed. A nonlinear partial correlation coefficient is introduced to better identify the predictors that have nonlinear functional dependence with the response. The selected subset is competent input for commonly used predictive models. Superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated against state-of-the-art baselines in terms of predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

AB Many evolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to assist with job scheduling in manufacturing. One of the main approaches is genetic algorithms (GAs). However, due to their complexity, users may need help understanding or communicating GA applications, preventing their widespread acceptance among factory workers. The concept of explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to address this issue. This study reviews existing XAI techniques for explaining GA applications in job scheduling and summarizes the problems existing XAI techniques face. Several novel XAI techniques are proposed to solve these problems, including decision tree-based interpretation, dynamic transformation and contribution diagrams, and improved bar charts. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, it is applied to a case from the literature. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology can compensate for the deficiencies of existing XAI methods in handling high-dimensional data and visualizing the contribution of feasible solutions, thereby satisfying all the requirements for an effective XAI technique for explaining GA applications in job scheduling. Additionally, the proposed methodology can be easily extended to explain other evolutionary AI applications in job scheduling, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm.

AB To address information vagueness and uncertainty of the order demand, the logistics service provider (LSP) service capacity and the target preference caused by emergency events, a multiobjective team optimization model is developed for the customer order decoupling point (CODP) decision, supplier selection and order quantity allocation problems in customized logistics service supply chain. Three important techniques are described: (1) Fuzzy objective coefficients due to the uncertainty of the order and objective weights. (2) Fuzzy constraint parameters due to LSP service capacity and order demand variations. (3) A fuzzy single objective weighting technique with acceptance coefficient of constraint and fuzzy parameters that reflects decision-maker preferences. The acceptance coefficients of the constraints are integrated into the single objective model, which reflects the satisfaction level of the logistics service integrator (LSI) for feasible solutions. Then, we perform fuzzy decision and feasible solution design based on the center of gravity method defuzzification and maximum membership degree principle. To optimize decisions for decision-makers, the effects of some important fuzzy objective coefficients and fuzzy constraint parameters on the CODP decision and the acceptance coefficient of constraint was explored through sensitivity analysis. Numerical experiments show that the scale effect coefficient and objective function threshold have greater effects on the CODP decision.

AB We propose a twin support vector quantile regression (TSVQR) to capture the heterogeneous and asymmetric information in modern data. Using a quantile parameter, TSVQR effectively depicts the heterogeneous distribution information with respect to all portions of data points. Correspondingly, TSVQR constructs two smaller sized quadratic programming problems (QPPs) to generate two nonparallel planes to measure the distributional asymmetry between the lower and upper bounds at each quantile level. The QPPs in TSVQR are smaller and easier to solve than those in previous quantile regression methods. Moreover, the dual coordinate descent algorithm for TSVQR also accelerates the training speed. Experimental results on six artificial data sets, five benchmark data sets, two large scale data sets, two time-series data sets, and two imbalanced data sets indicate that the TSVQR outperforms previous quantile regression methods in terms of the effectiveness of completely capturing the heterogeneous and asymmetric information and the efficiency of the learning process.

AB Privacy protection has received widespread attention from the community of discrete event systems to protect the sensitive information of users or organizations from being leaked. The existing privacy protection methods cannot protect the state information of probabilistic discrete event systems via repeated observations, which represents the information pertaining to system resource configurations. This work introduces differential privacy into the framework of probabilistic labeled Petri nets to solve the problems pertaining to the initial state protection. For two initial states that are adjacent under a specified measure, a state differential privacy verification method is proposed by determining whether the probability distributions of observations generated from adjacent initial states are similar. An external attacker is unlikely to infer the initial state via repeated observations if the system satisfies state differential privacy for certain adjacent initial states. For a probabilistic labeled Petri net, which does not satisfy state differential privacy, a supervisory control method is proposed for enforcement. A maximally permissive controller can be constructed based on the control specification proposed in this paper. Experimental studies show that the method proposed in the paper can effectively protect the privacy of given adjacent initial states.

DE Anomaly detection; Surface defect detection; Anomaly classification;
   MVTec LOCO AD
AB Existing industrial visual anomaly detection models can be broadly categorized into two paradigms, i.e., the paradigm based on image reconstruction and the paradigm based on implicit feature modeling. While both of them have demonstrated great performance in detecting low-level structural anomalies, their limited adjustability and ability to detect high-level logical anomalies hinder their broader use in industrial visual inspection. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a novel paradigm, that is, Component-aware Anomaly Detection (ComAD), which can simultaneously achieve adjustable and logical anomaly detection. Specifically, it segments the original image into diverse components, enabling model adjustability based on components' significance and long-range modeling capabilities based on components' metrological characteristics. We demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can be realized by a lightweight and nearly training-free framework. ComAD is evaluated on real-world scenarios to show its adjustability and logical anomaly detection capabilities. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec LOCO AD and CAD-SD benchmarks. Code is available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/ComAD.

AB Urban areas in many countries face significant concerns over the presence of aerosol particles and their effects on human health. These particles, which range in size from 1 nanometer to 100 micrometers, can easily penetrate organic matter and transport toxic gas compounds and mineral substances such as carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. High concentrations of airborne particles pose serious challenges to health, the economy, the environment, and society, and it is crucial to investigate ways to improve the quality of life for people. The main objective of this study is to develop a framework that accurately predicts aerosol and air quality index (AQI) values in advance by estimating missing data and predicting future data. To achieve this, we propose the DAerosol.GAN.NTM framework, which combines a neural Turing machine with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to address the limitations of previous studies. Our framework outperforms previous methods, including DAerosol.NTM (without GAN) and four baseline studies using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep LSTM (DLSTM) models, in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the prediction of aerosol pollution surge hours in advance according to the Time Interval Before and After the Aerosol Event (TIBAAE) criterion.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Large-span steel trusses are often adopted as roof structures of public and industrial buildings. Besides significant property loss, the unexpected and sudden collapse of large-span steel trusses caused by fires also threatens the lives of firefighters and trapped people in fires. To prevent casualties to the greatest extent, real-time evaluation of the structural collapse state of the building at fire rescue scenes is critical. This paper presents a novel framework for early warning the collapse of large-span steel truss structures in fire based on proposing the FASTAlertNet. The FAST-AlertNet can easily obtain real-time displacements based on easily-measured rotations and temperatures of the steel trusses during fire synchronously. Rotations and temperatures, which reflect uncertain structural parameters of steel trusses and fire scenarios, serve as inputs, while displacements are the outputs. A dynamic weighted loss function is employed in the FAST-AlertNet, yielding better performance reflecting the early-warning points than traditional loss functions. To address the high computational cost of obtaining real spatiotemporal patterns of temperature development inside the building in real fire scenes, transfer learning is utilized to transfer the interlinkage among displacements, temperatures, and rotations established by simplified parametric temperature curves, resulting in improved prediction accuracy in reality. A case study demonstrates the availability of the proposed framework, with the predicted remaining pre-collapse time of a typical steel truss satisfactorily matching the real value. Notably, the proposed framework provides a new methodology for early warning building collapse without requiring the difficultly-measured displacements in fire, which advances its feasibility for practical application.

AB Image encryption (IE) has been essential for internet-based storing and transferring in recent years. Effective chaotic systems play a crucial role in IE schemes which widely depend on chaotic maps and keys. However, the existing chaotic maps suffer from low performance and narrow chaotic ranges, and they utilize casual key generation approaches rather than optimum keys. In this study, an IE scheme based on key optimization using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and a novel modular integrated logistic exponential (MILE) map is presented. The chaotic performance of the MILE map is validated across a comparison with the existing maps thorough measurements such as LE, SE, 0-1 Test, and PE with means values of 12.0000, 2.1866, 0.9981, and 0.9998, respectively. The key is optimized on a small part of the image to be encrypted instead of the whole image that is employed by the existing works. That is why the IE scheme is faster than those works. Afterward, the PSO-based IE scheme is undergone reliable crypto-analyses and attacks. It is also verified through a comparison with the existing IE schemes. The proposed IE scheme is the best owing to having exceptional mean values of key sensitivity 99.6117, variance 893.12, chi 2 222.4057, information entropy 7.9994, NPCR 99.6090, and UACI 33.4662. Thanks to the MILE map, the PSO-based IE scheme demonstrates excellent numerical and visual encryption results.

ID HEURISTICS
AB With the advent of the era of big data, more and more complex networks and knowledge based systems require data visualization for analysis and presentation, where graphs have become a standard representation model. Graph drawing addresses the problems of constructing geometric representations of graphs to make them easy to analyze. In this paper we aim to reduce the edge crossing number in the context of the incremental graph drawing problem (IGDP), in which we want to preserve the layout of a graph over successive drawings to present complex networks or knowledge-based systems. Specifically, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm called multiple neighborhood solution-based tabu search (MNSB-TS) by combining a solution-based tabu strategy and a multiple neighborhood structure for solving the incremental graph drawing problem. Our MNSB-TS approach introduces four neighborhood operators to accompany the solution-based tabu strategy for determining the tabu status of each neighbor solution. Extensive computational experiments on public benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed MNSB-TS is highly competitive in comparison with the state-of-the-art heuristics and the exact optimization solver Gurobi. Key components of the approach are analyzed to evaluate their impact on algorithm performance and learn which search mechanisms are better suited for incremental graph drawing.

AB The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations at different fidelity levels are a common tool for predicting the aerodynamic performance in many engineering applications such as; automotive and aerospace to cite a few. However, the associated computational costs with these simulations are not trivial, and using the CFD simulations might easily become unpractical specially at the early design stages. The number of the required CFD simulations could be reduced immensely by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods which can predict, for example, the aerodynamic coefficients based on previous and limited CFD simulations. Having discussed the AI potential to minimize the CFD usage, the objective of this work is to investigate and compare the ability of different AI methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients using the same CFD database from the literature. In this study, three different AI methods, namely; machine learning (e.g. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), CatBoost, Bagging, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM), Random Forest (RFR), Gradient Boosting), deep learning (e.g. One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D)) and surrogate models (e.g. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) have been utilized to estimate a sample CFD database (e.g. NACA0012, RAE2822) from the existing literature, and the prediction performance of these methods have been compared. The results show that, the aerodynamic coefficients predicted using CatBoost, XGB and Bagging are in good agreement with the reference CFD results. Furthermore, the proposed Conv1D method with LeakyReLU activation function showed a promising results in the development of aerodynamic models which can be used in the early stages of the air vehicles design. The obtained results from this work indicate that the CatBoost and the XGB models required much smaller training time compared to the Conv1D method, moreover, the proposed regression trees; CatBoost, Bagging and XGB can reduce the required number of CFD simulations significantly.

AB In the context of learning environments, the learner's attention and mental effort are of primary interest in the process of acquiring knowledge. Due to the skills and abilities of each learner, there is a growing need for generic and adaptive environments. In this work, we introduce a new architecture for such environments to assist the learner with a multi-agent-based approach. Using Electroencephalogram, this architecture generates learning content and interactions adapted for each learner. Moreover, this work presents a new unsupervised approach to estimate and recognize the learner's cognitive load based on the Standardized Euclidean Distance (SED) and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of brain rhythms within low frequencies, namely Theta[4-7 Hz] (theta) and Alpha [8-11 Hz] (alpha). The learner's outcomes and estimated mental efforts are combined in the evaluation process using a fuzzy logic-based approach. Three experimental protocols are adopted in order to validate our study. These protocols are based on cognitive tasks with different difficulty levels. Experimental results show that PSD in theta and alpha bands in the occipital lobe accurately describe changes in the learner's mental efforts and cognitive load according to the cognitive task difficulty level. Based on the Cohen Kappa coefficient, our cognitive load estimation approach, using alpha, is compared to an existing cognitive load index from the literature. This performance assessment process revealed large values (k >= 0.48) in the occipital lobe, which reflects the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results from this study are mainly used in educational engineering and reeducation in order to subjectively assess the approaches and treatments offered in these contexts.

AB In this work, we address the task of tumor cellularity (TC) estimation with a novel framework based on the label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm. We propose a self-ensemble label distribution learning framework (SLDL) to resolve the challenges of existing LDL-based methods, including difficulties for inter-rater ambiguity exploitation, proper and flexible label distribution generation, and accurate TC value recovery. The proposed SLDL makes four main contributions which have been demonstrated to be quite effective in numerous experiments. First, we propose an expertness-aware conditional VAE for diversified single-rater modeling and an attention-based multi-rater fusion strategy that enables effective inter-rater ambiguity exploitation. Second, we propose a template-based label distribution generation method that is tailored for the TC estimation task and constructs label distributions based on the annotation priors. Third, we propose a novel restricted distribution loss, significantly improving the TC value estimation by effectively regularizing the learning with unimodal loss and regression loss. Fourth, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously leverage inter-rater and intra-rater variability to address the label ambiguity issue in the breast tumor cellularity estimation tasks. The experimental results on the public BreastPathQ dataset demonstrate that the SLDL outperforms the existing methods by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results in the TC estimation task. The code will be available from https://github.com/PerceptionComputingLab/ULTRA.

TI Feature independent Filter Pruning by Successive Layers analysis
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING

DT Article
DE Feature independent filter pruning; Convolutional neural networks; Deep
   learning; Adaptive pruning; Model compression
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become deeper and wider over time. However due to low computational power, mobile devices or embedded systems cannot use very deep models. Filter pruning solves this by eliminating redundant filters. Pruning can be performed in a feature dependent or independent manner. Feature dependent methods require extensive time to determine the filter importance as these methods require generation and processing of feature maps for each example. Additionally, in iterative pruning, filter importance is computed several times based on the current state. This increases algorithm execution time further. However, existing feature independent methods are fast, but they perform poor as they compute importance using only current layer filter weights. However, our analysis suggests that both the current and succeeding layer filters are crucial to determine filter importance. We propose 'Filter Pruning by Successive Layers analysis' (FPSL), a novel feature independent algorithm, that considers the effect of pruning a filter on the generation of feature maps for the first time. Moreover, FPSL does not require layer-wise retraining, rigorous hyperparameter search for fine-tuning, or human intervention to set the pruning percentage per layer. These make FPSL extremely fast, efficient, and adaptive. Thus it follows iterative pruning and retraining. FPSL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on extensive experiments with different datasets (CIFAR, ImageNet) and architectures (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet). It decreases the computational burden of VGG16 by half but improves CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 accuracy. Even for ImageNet, FPSL reduces 42.7% floating point operations (FLOPs) while maintaining top-1 accuracy for ResNet50.

AB Solar thermal plants have high nonlinearities and non-manipulated energy source which make their control task a very challenging work. Linear controllers cannot cope with undesirable deviations of the outlet temperature over all the operation range of the dynamics of this type of plants. Moreover, nonlinear predictive control relying on online nonlinear optimization have the drawback of time consuming and numerical calculus issues. In this paper, an infinite gain scheduling neural predictive control is designed and applied to control the temperature in a distributed parabolic trough solar collector field. The performance of both tracking and disturbance rejection of the proposed controller is compared to those of four nonlinear predictive control variants: Two unconstrained neural predictive control using the Levenberg-Marquardt and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithms, and two constrained nonlinear predictive control using interior point algorithm, one is based on a neural network model and the other one is based on a first principal model. The superiority of the proposed control strategy is well demonstrated through simulation results.

AB In this article, a prescribed learning controller is developed for nonminimum phase air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (AHVs) in the presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. In comparison with the current state of the art, the most significant feature of our control design lies in introducing the Koopman operator to construct an intelligent output redefinition to overcome the nonminimum phase behavior. To evaluate the current control behavior and enhance the learning ability, an improved continuous-time performance index is developed under the actor-critic learning structure. Furthermore, combined with a nonlinear disturbance observer, prescribed learning control is proposed to design control commands, while compensating for lumped disturbances, including neural approximation errors and external disturbances. Numerical simulations have been performed to highlight the superiority of the proposed learning control.

AB The abundance of artificial intelligence AI algorithms and growing computing power has brought a disruptive revolution to the smart medical industry. Its powerful data abstraction and representation capabilities enable the modeling of hundreds of millions of medical data, such as sub-Computed Tomography tumor identification, retinal lesion screening, and survival curve analysis. However, all of these applications demonstrate AI's use of unimodal data for specific tasks. In contrast, clinicians deal with multi-modal data from multiple sources when diagnosing, performing prognostic assessments, and deciding on treatment plans. These requirements have facilitated the development of multi-modal AI solutions and improved the performance of AI models in handling complex medical scenarios and data. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of the art and research in multi-modal biomedical AI, including applications, data, methods, and analytics. Additionally, we summarize potential research directions for multi-modal AI technologies in the future of healthcare.

AB In large-scale evolutionary multiobjective optimization, the size of the search space expands exponentially as the number of decision variables increases, which makes it more difficult to find an optimal search region and generate promising offspring. For this purpose, this paper proposes an offspring regeneration-based algorithm driven by finite element mapping, which can be divided into two stages. The first stage uses a competitive swarm optimizer to perform a pre-section of the initial population and then maps each individual into a location in a finite element region. During evolution, the population searches along these locations. The search region changes from an infinite number of points on the search space to a finite number of points, thus accelerating the convergence to the optimal region. In the second stage, a dual sampling strategy that includes convergence-based sampling and diversity-based sampling is proposed to generate more promising offspring, which balances the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. By comparing it with five state-of -the-art large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared algorithms on LSMOPs problems with up to 5000 decision variables and achieves satisfactory results on real-world problems.

AB Multi-objective immunization algorithms have received wide attention in solving multi-objective optimization problems. However, most multi-objective immune algorithms use clone selection strategies to accelerate convergence and focus on only the local information of clone solutions, which damages the diversity of the population and leads the algorithms to fall into local optimum easily. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective immunization algorithm based on dynamic variation distance. First, the algorithm ensures the uniform distribution of the optimal solution by the established dynamic variation distance model. Second, we divide the population into mainpop and auxpop by quality, and design a new evolutionary strategy to achieve specific variants at different evolutionary stages under different constraints. Third, the mating selection strategy and the population selection operator are further explored to handle infeasible solutions adaptively in the late evolutionary stage. And we have conducted extensive experiments on the proposed algorithm. The results prove that our proposed algorithm outperforms 14 existing algorithms in most cases of 16 test problems, which confirms the superiority of the algorithm.

AB This study proposes an accurate asthma detection model using an attention network and machine learning technique. The objective of this study is the automated detection of asthma using an attention network. The lung sounds from 203 subjects involving 767 segments from asthma and 722 segments from healthy subjects were collected using a stethoscope. A novel Attention ResNet18-based deep feature engineering model has been developed in five phases: preprocessing, training the Attention ResNet18 network, extracting deep features, iterative feature selection, and classification using k-nearest neighbor (kNN) or support vector machine (SVM). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to generate heat maps, effectively distinguishing asthma lung sounds from those of normal individuals. By using Grad-CAM, explainable results have been presented. Our proposed model obtained an accuracy of 99.73% using SVM with 10-fold cross-validation, surpassing the performance obtained by previous models. Hence, the developed model has the potential to detect asthma in the real-world scenario. scenario to detect.

TI FedMMD: A Federated weighting algorithm considering Non-IID and Local
   Model Deviation
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; Distributed machine learning; Non-IID; Entropy
   weight method
AB Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning method to protect users' privacy and security. It currently faces the following two problems (McMahan et al., 2017): (1) The performance of the global model degrades when dealing with Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data. Other existing classical methods do not have a rigorous theory based on error processing ; (2) In the process of global model aggregation, the classical FL algorithm either directly averages local models or solely considers the proportion of local data to assign weights to the models, without accounting for the discrepancies between the local models. In this paper, a federated aggregation algorithm Federated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (FedMMD) is proposed to address the deviation between the local models and Non-IID. First of all, this paper utilizes the Dilated Convolution Meet Transformer (DCMT) model for local model feature extraction. This approach aims to capture more feature information and minimize the impact of Non-IID scenarios. Secondly, the learning stability of the local model data participating in the aggregation is compared with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The weights of the local models involved in the aggregation are determined using the SKNQ (Student-Keuls-Newman-Q) method and the entropy weight method. The SKNQ method calculates and compares the MMD across multiple clients, while the entropy weight method assigns different weights to clients based on their deviations. On the standard dataset, the FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017), the FedProx algorithm (Li et al., 2020) and the FedMMD algorithm are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the FedMMD algorithm, used in training the global model, not only enhances the accuracy of learning IID and Non-IID data but also improves the generalization capability of the global model.

AB In real-world routing applications such as waste collection or fuel distribution, multiple products that cannot be mixed should be jointly collected or delivered. Multi-compartment vehicles are applied with great flexibility in routing and assignment decisions for these real-world applications. This study concentrates on the multicompartment vehicle routing problem with fixed compartment size and fixed assignment products to compartments. For this problem, we develop two new formulations in the space-time network and state-space-time network. For the state-space-time network formulation, we dualize the task allocation constraints to the objective function and decompose the Lagrangian relaxed problem (LR) into a series of identical routing subproblems. To produce high-quality feasible solutions, the augmented Lagrangian relaxed problem (ALR) with superior convergence and feasibility is further applied to this problem. The ALR is decomposed into many solvable routing subproblems by alternating direction method of multipliers. A time-dependent dynamic programming algorithm is developed to settle the obtained subproblems of the LR and ALR. The subgradient optimization method solves the Lagrangian dual problems. The solution quality can be evaluated by the relative gap between the global lower and upper bounds at each iteration. In numerical experiments, the proposed method produces solutions with good integrality gaps. Based on Lagrangian relaxation and decomposition techniques, this research provides a novel solving scheme for the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem.

AB The complexity of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) makes it challenging for decision-makers (DMs) to reach an optimal decision. Therefore, this study sought to develop a novel picture fuzzy MCDM framework with partially known criterion weight information to enable DMs to select the most appropriate alternatives. As such, this study made several key contributions. Firstly, this study defined a novel picture fuzzy bidirectional projection measure that simultaneously accounted for distance and direction, thus overcoming the inherent drawbacks of existing picture fuzzy projection measures. Secondly, both objectivity and subjectivity were taken into account in the decision-making process, thus avoiding the limitations of considering only a single subjective weight or an objective weight. Additionally, based on the proposed bidirectional projection measure, Jaynes's maximum entropy principle, and minimal deviations, a nonlinear programming model was constructed to determine the comprehensive weight vector of the criteria. Thirdly, the existing VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method always utilizes distance to measure the closeness degrees to the ideal solutions while ignoring the influence of the direction factor. Therefore, an improved picture fuzzy VIKOR method incorporating bidirectional projection was proposed to conduct selection process. Finally, a picture fuzzy evaluation framework was constructed by coupling bidirectional projection measures and the VIKOR method. The applicability of the proposed MCDM framework was then evaluated by solving a supplier selection problem, after which sensitivity and comparison analyses were performed to illustrate. its robustness and reliability.

AB Under dual constraints of green production responsibility and recycling responsibility, the optimal contract between upstream and downstream firms is crucial to achieve low-carbon development, but information asymmetry poses a great challenge to the above contract design. Based on Stackelberg game theory, this paper develops a contract model in a supply chain with information asymmetry under dual environmental responsibility constraints, in which the producer invests in green technology while the retailer exerts green marketing efforts. The paper aims to explore how the producer designs optimal contracts under the different information structures to improve environmental performance while ensuring profitability. Results indicate that: (i) in the full information scenario, the two-part optimal contract makes the decentralized supply chain to achieve the same channel profit and carbon emissions as the centralized scenario. (ii) In the information asymmetry scenario, the producer should design differentiated contract configurations for different types of retailers to eliminate double marginalization. That is, the producer designs low wholesale price and high side payment for the high-type retailer, which enables the producer to earn high profit with low carbon emissions and makes the retailer to obtain additional information profit. While under some conditions, the producer considers the possibility of terminating cooperation with the retailer of low-type, as such a cutoff policy not only guarantees the profitability of the channel members but also improves environmental performance. Furthermore, the impact of some key factors on firms' decisions, profits, and equilibrium carbon emissions is summarized to guide management decisions.

AB Given the adverse impact of fake news propagation on Social media, fake news mitigation has been one of the main research directions. However, existing approaches neglect fairness towards each community while minimizing the adverse impact of fake news propagation. This results in the exclusion of some minor and underrepresented communities from the benefits of the intervention, which can have important societal repercussions. This research proposes a fairness-aware truth-campaigning method, called FWRRS (Fairness-aware Weighted Reversible Reachable System), which focuses on blocking the influence propagation of a competing entity, in this case, with the use case of fake news mitigation. The proposed method employs weighted reversible reachable trees and maximin fairness to achieve its goals. Experimental analysis shows that FWRRS outperforms fairness-oblivious and fairness-aware methods in terms of both total outreach and fairness. The results show that in the proposed approach, such fairness does not come at a cost in efficiency, and in fact, in most cases, it works as a catalyst for achieving better effectiveness in the future. In real-world networks, we observe up to similar to 10% improvement in the saved nodes and similar to 57% improvement in maximin fairness as compared to the second best-performing baseline, which varies for each network.

ID FIELD SEGMENTATION
AB Lung segmentation is an essential step in a computer-aided diagnosis system for chest radiographs. The lung parenchyma is first segmented in pulmonary computer-aided diagnosis systems to remove the interference of non-lung regions while increasing the effectiveness of the subsequent work. Nevertheless, most medical image segmentation methods nowadays use U-Net and its variants. These variant networks perform poorly in segmentation to detect smaller structures and cannot accurately segment boundary regions. A multi-interaction feature fusion network model based on Kiu-Net is presented in this paper to address this problem. Specifically, U-Net and Ki-Net are first utilized to extract high-level and detailed features of chest images, respectively. Then, cross-residual fusion modules are employed in the network encoding stage to obtain complementary features from these two networks. Second, the global information module is introduced to guarantee the segmented region's integrity. Finally, in the network decoding stage, the multi-interaction module is presented, which allows to interact with multiple kinds of information, such as global contextual information, branching features, and fused features, to obtain more practical information. The performance of the proposed model was assessed on both the Montgomery County (MC) and Shenzhen datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods according to the experimental results.
   Most current medical image segmentation methods use U-Net and its variants. However, these networks are not good at detecting the segmentation of smaller structures and cannot accurately segment the boundary region. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-interaction feature fusion network model based on Kiu-Net, which can be used to achieve high-precision segmentation of chest radiograph lung region.image

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Thanks to their outstanding performance in image translation and generation, they play an increasingly important role in computer vision applications. Most approaches based on GAN focus on proposing task-specific auxiliary modules or loss functions that are tailored to address various challenges of a single application, but often do not perform better when evaluated to improve other image generation tasks. Moreover, the basic ResNet and U-Net based GAN generators reach their limits in many image restoration and enhancement use cases. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic GAN referred to as Multi-Kernel Filter-based Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (MFGAN). We develop a new GAN generator with multiple CNN streams to extract more relevant and discriminative features related to the studied task. The proposed MFNet generator consists of two CNN modules, feature extraction and feature compression, which are combined to connect both the GAN encoder and decoder. It considers the strengths of conventional layers at different scale levels with multi-kernel filtering to capture high to low feature frequencies that reflect the complex image degradations and structural image details. Extensive experiments on five challenging applications for image enhancement, image restoration, and infrared image translation demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed MFGAN in removing image degradation and generating visually appealing fake images. Our MFGAN quantitatively outperforms both state-of-the-art GANs and other CNN-based architectures in all tested benchmarks.

AB Analyzing and understanding large and complex volumes of biological data is a challenging task as data becomes more widely available. In biomedical research, gene expression data are among the most commonly used biological data. Formal concept analysis frequently identifies deferentially expressed genes in microarray data. Top-K formal concepts are effective at producing effective Formal Concepts. To our knowledge, no existing algorithm can complete the difficult task of identifying only important biclusters. For this purpose, a new Top-K formal concepts-based algorithm for mining biclusters from gene expression data is proposed: Top-BicMiner. It extracts biclusters' sets with positively and negatively correlated genes according to distinct correlation measures. The proposed method is applied to both synthetic and real-life microarray datasets. The experimental results highlight the Top-BicMiner's ability to identify statistically and biologically significant biclusters.

AB Pure strategy board games such as chess are popular intellectual activities, and solving them is a challenging task in computer science. In addition to traditional games, many new board games have gained popularity in recent years. Ostle is one such unsolved game published in 2017. It is based on simple rules but is highly competitive. It is a two-player zero-sum game with perfect information in which the game-theoretical values of all game states can be obtained. In this study, we strongly solved Ostle by retrograde analysis. Utilizing various known techniques, including bitboards and succinct indexable dictionaries, significantly reduced the memory consumption in the analyses. We confirmed that the initial position is a draw and found some fundamental properties of Ostle. Additionally, we manually composed a tactical Ostle puzzle with the help of extracted outputs of the analyses. The result demonstrates that solving recent games provided helpful information to compose high-quality problems.

AB In the current era, blockchain technology has emerged as a novel technique to maintain the operations of healthcare management systems. The global COVID-19 disease has led to increase in the utilization of technology for healthcare supply chain, patient data management, and claims settlement. Data management in healthcare industry is a complex procedure where multiple organizations offer appropriate supply chain facilities in everyday life. Inadequate data handling disrupts the supply chain, which has a longstanding impact on the healthcare region. Blockchain-based solutions are renowned for their ability to produce safe and traceable results and effective in the health sector for secure data retrieval and storage, resulting in more effectual product creation and tracking. These technologies can deliver data provenance, sponsors candid healthcare industry demands, and certifies the immutability of multi direction transactions. Due to involvement of multiple factors/ criteria, the selection of an effective blockchain platform-based healthcare supply chain can be treated as a decision support system (DSS) problem. Thus, the objective of this paper is to present a novel interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy DSS for evaluating the blockchain platforms for healthcare supply chain and selecting a suitable one with respect to multiple criteria and uncertainty. The proposed DSS framework is divided into three stages. First, some fairly aggregation operators are presented to combine the individual's information and also discussed their desirable characteristics on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs). Second, an integrated weighting tool is developed using entropy-based tool for objective weight of criteria and pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model for subjective weight of criteria with IVPFSs. For this purpose, new entropy is presented on IVPFSs. Third, the multi-attribute ideal-real comparative analysis (MAIRCA) model is developed with the combination of fairly aggregation operators, entropy-based weighting tool and PIPRECIA model with interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy information. Further, the proposed DSS is used on a case study of blockchain platforms for healthcare supply chain evaluation, which confirms its applicability and usefulness. Sensitivity and comparative assessments are carried out to check the consistency, robustness and efficiency of the presented method.

First, the definition and existence of the EID are given, and the configuration of the EID estimator is provided. Next, estimation errors in the conventional EID approach are explained, and error-suppression methods are exhibited, which improve the disturbance-rejection performance. Then, this article describes how to apply the EID approach and associate challenges in dealing with nonlinearities, time delays, and uncertainties. Moreover, this article reviews some additional meaningful studies that cannot be categorized into the above-mentioned classes. Finally, some conclusions and future directions are given. The EID approach has been successfully used to suppress the influences of exogenous disturbances, nonlinearities, time delays, and uncertainties in many control systems to improve control performance and robustness. Studies can further rich the theory of the EID approach in the future, such as designing evaluation index, improving disturbance-rejection performance, developing new applications, and combining with other control theory.

AB The existing hand gesture classification research based on surface electromyogram (sEMG) faces the challenges of low classification accuracy, weak real-time ability, weak robustness, few categories, and lack of explainability. In this article, we investigate how to classify sEMG signals for grasp recognition and human-robot interaction to consider these issues. A novel interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy classifier based on explainable neural network is proposed for sEMG gesture recognition. Based on fully connected neural network, the adaptive moment estimation is applied to tune the antecedent parameters. The Ninapro data is adopted to test the performance of the proposed model, which realizes recognition of 52 gestures and achieves 95.04% categorization accuracy. Moreover, grasping experiments are conducted on computer, communication, and consumer electronics (3C) experiment platform to test the ability of the classifier in real scenarios. The experiment recognizes six gestures. The results of the 3C grasping experiment show that the proposed method achieves 99.4% offline training accuracy as well as 96.07% online test accuracy. Meanwhile, 89.4% of the classification results can be obtained within 0.5 s. The overall results demonstrate great potential for real-world applications, such as human intent detection and manipulator control.

DE Brain tumor segmentation; Three-dimensional U-Net; External attention;
   Self-calibrated convolution
AB Recently, U-Net architecture with its strong adaptability has become prevalent in the field of MRI brain tumor segmentation. Meanwhile, researchers have demonstrated that introducing attention mechanisms, especially self-attention, into U-Net can effectively improve the performance of segmentation models. However, the self-attention has disadvantages of heavy computational burden, quadratic complexity as well as ignoring the potential correlations between different samples. Besides, current attention segmentation models seldom focus on adaptively computing the receptive field of tumor images that may capture discriminant information effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D U-Net related brain tumor segmentation model dubbed as self-calibrated attention U-Net (SCAU-Net) in this work, which simultaneously introduces two lightweight modules, i.e., external attention module and self-calibrated convolution module, into a single U-Net. More specifically, SCAU-Net embeds the external attention into the skip connection to better utilize encoding features for semantic up-sampling, and it leverages several 3D self-calibrated convolution modules to replace the original convolution layers, which adaptively computes the receptive field of tumor images for effective segmentation. SCAU-Net achieves segmentation results on the BraTS 2020 validation dataset with the dice similarity coefficient of 0.905, 0.821 and 0.781 and the 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 4.0, 9.7 and 29.3 on the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. Similarly, competitive results are obtained on BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2019 validation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCAU-Net outperforms its baseline and achieves outstanding performance compared to various representative brain tumor models.

ID ADAPTIVE OPTIMAL-CONTROL
AB This paper concludes a robust optimal tracking control law for a class of nonlinear systems. A characteristic of this paper is that the designed controller can guarantee both robustness and optimality under nonlinearity and mismatched disturbances. Optimal controllers for nonlinear systems are difficult to obtain, hence a reinforcement learning method is adopted with two neural networks (NNs) approximating the cost function and optimal controller, respectively. We designed weight update laws for critic NN and actor NN based on gradient descent and stability, respectively. In addition, matched and mismatched disturbances are estimated by fixed-time disturbance observers and an artful transformation based on backstepping method is employed to convert the system into a filtered error nonlinear system. Through a rigorous analysis using the Lyapunov method, we demonstrate states and estimation errors remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through two illustrative examples.

AB A combined electric vehicles (EVs) and controllable loads scheduling framework is presented in this paper for a microgrid aimed at minimizing the operating cost and emissions. The microgrid is equipped with renewable power generation by using wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In this respect, EVs would be used for load profile flattening and controllable loads would be used to address the reserve requirements of the system mainly due to intermittent renewable power generation. The problem is formulated as a two-stage scheduling program to specify the expected operating cost and reserve. The first stage aims to minimize the total costs including the generation and reserve costs. The second stage seeks to minimize the redispatch costs due to volatile renewable power generation. The resulting optimization problem is then solved by using the modified manta ray foraging optimization algorithm known as "MMRFO". This algorithm is an efficacious one being capable of handling various types of optimization problems. The findings obtained from a 24-h analysis of an MG model demonstrate the superior performance of the MMRFO algorithm when compared to other established methodologies. The obtained results by applying the MMRFO method indicate high efficiency of this algorithm in comparison with some other well-known algorithms when tackling the combined EV and controllable loads scheduling problem in the presence of wind and solar power generation.

   algorithms and systems; Explanation fidelity
AB Modern machine learning methods allow for complex and in-depth analytics, but the predictive models generated by these methods are often highly complex and lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to improve the interpretability of these complex "black box" models, thereby increasing transparency and enabling informed decision-making. However, the inherent fitness of these explainable methods, particularly the faithfulness of explanations to the decision-making processes of the model, can be hard to evaluate. In this work, we examine and evaluate the explanations provided by four XAI methods, using fully transparent "glass box" models trained on tabular data. Our results suggest that the fidelity of explanations is determined by the types of variables used, as well as the linearity of the relationship between variables and model prediction. We find that each XAI method evaluated has its own strengths and weaknesses, determined by the assumptions inherent in the explanation mechanism. Thus, though such methods are model-agnostic, we find significant differences in explanation quality across different technical setups. Given the numerous factors that determine the quality of explanations, including the specific explanation-generation procedures implemented by XAI methods, we suggest that model-agnostic XAI methods may still require expert guidance for implementation.

AB In this paper, a viable, robust, and highly accurate additive hybrid model employing autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) with functionally expanded inputs (Additive-ARFIMA-SVM) is presented for forecasting the air quality index (AQI). Additionally, thirteen additive and multiplicative hybrid models are introduced. Several alternatives in feature engineering employing functional expansion of inputs are incorporated to boost the performance of hybrid models. Furthermore, a gradient whale optimization algorithm with group best leader strategy (GWOA-GBL) based meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed. The missing values are imputed and a variable weight ensemble forecasting model is developed using the proposed GWOA-GBL algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Additive-ARFIMA-SVM forecasting model with functionally expanded inputs, comparisons are made with sixteen machine learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), five statistical models, seventeen hybrid models, and ten variable weight ensemble models. Extensive statistical analyses are carried out on the obtained results considering four accuracy measures that show the statistical supremacy of the proposed Additive-ARFIMA-SVM model and GWOA-GBL algorithm in predicting the AQI time series. The proposed Additive-ARFIMA-SVM model with functionally expanded inputs improves the AQI forecasting performance by 16.34% than autoregressive integrated moving average, 14.47% than ARFIMA, 33.96% than XGBoost, 43.47% than SVM, 49.39% than LSTM, 8.64% than Multiplicative-ARIMA-SVM model considering symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The proposed Additive-ARFIMA-SVM model is so efficient and reliable that it can be applied to forecast other time series like stock price, electricity load, crude oil price, sunspot number, stream flow, flood, drought etc.

AB The Neural Architecture Search (NAS) problem is typically formulated as a graph search problem where the goal is to learn the optimal operations over edges in order to maximize a graph-level global objective. Due to the large architecture parameter space, efficiency is a key bottleneck preventing NAS from its practical use. In this work, we address the issue by framing NAS as a multi-agent problem where agents control a subset of the network and coordinate to reach optimal architectures. We provide two distinct lightweight implementations, with reduced memory requirements (1/8th of state-of-the-art), and performances above those of much more computationally expensive methods. Theoretically, we demonstrate vanishing regrets of the form O(root T), with T being the total number of rounds. Finally, we perform experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and aware that random search and random sampling are (often ignored) effective baselines, we conducted additional experiments on 3 alternative datasets, with complexity constraints, and 2 network configurations, and achieve competitive results in comparison with the baselines and other methods.

AB Epilepsy is a life threatening neurological disorder. The person with epilepsy suffers from recurrent seizures. Sudden emission of electrical signal in the nerves of the human brain is called seizure event. The most widely used method for diagnosing epi-lepsy is analysing electroencephalogram signals in short called as EEG signals col-lected from the scalp of the patient. The EEG data are normally used for seizure detection. If the recurrent seizure signals are detected in the input EEG dataset, then it can be considered as the presence of epilepsy disorder. Manual inspection of sei-zure signals in the EEG data is a laborious process. An automated system is very cru-cial for the neurologists to identify seizures. In this paper, an automated seizure detection method is presented using deep learning method, pre-trained convolutional neural network architecture. Freely available EEG dataset from Temple University Hospital database is used for the study. The pre-trained CNN networks, VGGNet and ResNet are used for classifying the seizure activities from non-seizure activities. CNNs are extremely good in learning the features of the input data. A very large dataset from TUH is provided as input to the multiple layers of CNN model. The same data is fed to VGGNet and ResNet models. The results of CNN, VGGNet and ResNet models are assessed using performance metrics accuracy, AUC, precision and recall. All the three models gave extremely good performance compared to state-of -the-art works in the literature. In comparison VGGNet performed with little higher results giving 97% accuracy, 96% AUC, 97% precision and 79% recall.

AB In this paper, I describe my artistic project, Igun-a StyleGAN series trained to animate the research question: what bronze objects could have been produced should the 1897 British invasion not have occurred in the Benin Kingdom? In addition to looting over 3000 palace-commissioned artworks, I surmise that the invasion resulted in a 17-year (1897-1914) artistic decline. Although post-invasion colonial reports referred to a thriving art scene and increased colonial art patronage, there is a dearth of visual documentation to identify objects created during this period. Considering this absence, I propose Igun, a series of StyleGAN models trained on a dataset of looted Benin Bronzes. This project is informed by the Igun Eronmwon's (the royal guild of bronze casters) artistic protocols. Finally, I present three prototypes based on emergent themes-infancy and facial expressions, which were underexplored in Benin's classical bronze casting tradition.

AB A comprehensive approach is presented to analyse season's coastal upwelling represented by weekly sea surface temperature (SST) image grids. Our three-stage data recovery clustering method assumes that the season's upwelling can be divided into shorter periods of stability, ranges, each to be represented by a constant core and variable shell parts. Corresponding clustering algorithms parameters are automatically derived by using the least-squares clustering criterion. The approach has been successfully applied to real-world SST data covering two distinct regions: Portuguese coast and Morocco coast, for 16 years each.

AB Golden Jackal Optimization (GJO) is a recently developed nature-inspired algorithm that is motivated by the collaborative hunting behaviours of the golden jackals in nature. However, the GJO has the disadvantage of poor exploitation ability and is easy to get stuck in an optimal local region. To overcome these disadvantages, in this paper, an enhanced variant of the golden jackal optimization algorithm that incorporates the opposition-based learning (OBL) technique (OGJO) is proposed. The OBL technique is implemented into GJO with a probability rate, which can assist the algorithm in escaping from the local optima. To validate the efficiency of OGJO, several experiments have been performed. The experimental outcomes revealed that the proposed OGJO has more efficiency than GJO and other compared algorithms.

   Production workshop
AB Three-dimensional (3D) instance segmentation, as an effective method for scene object recognition, can effectively enhance workshop intelligence. However, the existing 3D instance segmentation network is difficult to apply in workshop scenes due to the large number of 3D instance segmentation labels and 3D information acquisition devices required. In this paper, a monocular 3D instance segmentation network is proposed, which achieves satisfactory results while relying on a monocular RGB camera without 3D instance segmentation labels. The proposed method has two stages. In the first stage, the double-snake multitask network is proposed to solve the problem of a lack of 3D information acquisition devices. It simultaneously performs depth estimation and instance segmentation and uses the features obtained from depth estimation to guide the instance segmentation task. In the second stage, an adaptive point cloud filtering algorithm that performs adaptive point cloud noise filtering on multi-scale objects based on two-dimensional prior information is proposed to solve the problem of a lack of 3D labels. In addition, color information is introduced into the filtering process to further improve filtering accuracy. Experiments on the Cityscapes and SOP datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method. When the IoU threshold is set to 0.35, the mean average precision (mAP) is 50.41. Our approach is deployed in an actual production workshop to verify its feasibility.

DE Tool condition monitoring; Multivariate time series; Feature extraction;

ID WEAR; PREDICTION
AB In intelligent machining, tool condition monitoring (TCM) is crucial to improving tool efficiency and machining accuracy, which requires the real-time analysis and feature extraction of multivariate time series signals collected by multiple sensors. However, multivariate time series are ultra-high-dimensional and difficult to perform representation learning directly, requiring sampling and typical feature extraction. The existing deep feature extractors based on Sequential sampling, Random sampling, or Window sampling, are poor at capturing the critical information from the huge amount of time series data, and ignore the temporal associations, so the actual results are not satisfactory in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, we propose an appending-inspired multivariate time series association fusion method for TCM tasks: after the necessary denoising, we capture typical time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency-domain features of multivariate time series based on the proposed appending-inspired feature capturer to fully consider the temporal associations, and employ the ACNNs (Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) to extract and fuse the multivariate time series features for real-time TCM tasks. The experimental results on NASA and PHM2010 datasets show that our method can real-time and effectively monitor the tool condition and accurately predict the tool wear state.

AB Hesitant Fermatean fuzzy sets (HFFS) can characterize the membership degree (MD) and non-membership degree (NMD) of hesitant fuzzy elements in a broader range, which offers superior fuzzy data processing capabilities for addressing complex uncertainty issues. In this research, first, we present the definition of the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy Bonferroni mean operator (HFFBM). Further, with the basic operations of HFFS in Einstein t-norms, the definition and derivation process of the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy Einstein Bonferroni mean operator (HFFEBM) are given. In addition, considering how weights affect decision-making outcomes, the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy weighted Bonferroni mean (HFFWBM) operator and the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy Einstein weighted Bonferroni mean operator (HFFEWBM) are developed. Then, the properties of the operators are discussed. Based on HFFWBM and HFFEWBM operator, a new multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach is provided. Finally, we apply the proposed decision-making approach to the case of a depression diagnostic evaluation for three depressed patients. The three patients' diagnosis results confirmed the proposed method's validity and rationality. Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, the proposed MADM method is an efficient solution for decision-making issues in the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy environment.

AB Particles that are atomic and subatomic constitute up the entire cosmos. The laws of the quantum world apply to particles as well. It is essential to unravel the still-mysterious enigma of quantum physics in order to comprehend quantum systems. The intricacy of the human brain is almost as complicated as that of the cosmos. All of the aforementioned challenges were addressed in this study from the viewpoint of a quantum system. The comparative study and analysis of the human brain has incorporated use of quantum physics concepts including entanglement, superposition, no-cloning, and uncertainty. Also, this study investigated into how commercial quantum devices may serve hitherto unresolved areas of the brain. Investigations on quantum artificial neural networks that resemble the structure and operation of human neurons have also been undertaken. The effectiveness of the brain with various qubit sizes has then been compared. The authors next examined the efficiency of photon absorption, filtering, and transport as well as the amount of signal lost in the skin, ocular, intracranial, and intercranial spaces. Then, the intra-space and inter-space quantum entanglement error rates were compared using individual qubits, particles, and photons. These research all came to the same conclusion: the quantum mechanical principle may have been directly or indirectly developed from the human brain and other sensory organs. The human body, on the other hand, has a comparatively limited capability for comprehending quantum theory.

ID LEARNING FRAMEWORK
AB Deformable medical image registration (DMIR) is a crucial task in medical image analysis. Current learning-based approaches concatenate two images into two channels, then use convolution or transformer-based networks to extract features for modeling spatial correspondence. However, this approach mixes the features of the two images before searching for correspondence, making the spatial modeling process challenging. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a purely convolutional framework, DIEGraph, for DMIR. The proposed method first extracts features separately from the moving and fixed images using a dual-branch network. Then, it splits the features into patches and constructs a graph by connecting the nearest neighbors of these patches. Based on the graph representation, the proposed method uses an information exchange graph convolutional network module to exchange dual-branch information and model correspondence. Additionally, a dilated residual fusion module is deployed for feature fusion. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative evaluation on two 3D datasets. The proposed method achieved higher Dice scores than Transmorph by 0.9% and 3.8% on the two datasets, respectively, while maintaining a comparable voxel folding percentage. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of the components in the proposed model.

AB Traditional computing architecture (Von Neumann) that requires data transfer between the off-chip memory and processor consumes a large amount of energy when running machine learning (ML) models. Memristive synaptic devices are employed to eliminate this inevitable inefficiency in energy while solving cognitive tasks. However, the performances of energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, which are expected to provide promising results, need to be enhanced in terms of accuracy and test error rates for classification applications. Improving accuracy in such ML models depends on the optimal learning parameter changes from a device to algorithm-level optimisation. To do this, this paper considers the Adadelta, an adaptive learning rate technique, to achieve accurate results by reducing the losses and compares the accuracy, test error rates, and energy consumption of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad and Adadelta optimisation methods integrated into the Ag:a-Si synaptic device neural network model. The experimental results demonstrated that Adadelta enhanced the accuracy of the hardware-based neural network model by up to 4.32% when compared to the Adagrad method. The Adadelta method achieved the best accuracy rate of 94%, while DGD and SGD provided an accuracy rate of 68.11 and 75.37%, respectively. These results show that it is vital to select a proper optimisation method to enhance performance, particularly the accuracy and test error rates of the neuro-inspired nano-synaptic device-based neural network models.

AB With the development of data-centric artificial intelligence, more and more people pay attention to the importance of image information quality. Based on the core idea that images in datasets have different intra-class information richness and inter-class information overlaps, we propose a two-stage image quality assessment method. The images in the area with both a lower intra-class richness and a higher degree of inter-class overlap can provide more image information for the neural network, thus further improve the model performance. Experiments on two public image classification datasets for image classification (CIFAR10 and mini-ImageNet) show that the proposed image information quality assessment method can effectively distinguish high information quality images. Under the same budget, selecting images with higher image information quality can achieve better performances than lower image information quality (Testing accuracy: 1.69% higher on CIFAR10, 2.11% higher on mini-ImageNet).

ID BIO-INSPIRED OPTIMIZER; SEARCH ALGORITHM
AB In order to solve optimization problems, this paper introduces a new metaheuristic algorithm called the Numeric Crunch Algorithm (NCA), which employs the distribution behaviour of the population members and a novel hyperbolic acceleration function for convergence. Each generation's search space exploration and exploitation are ensured by the population's distribution behaviour around its members and their adaptively diversified boundaries, respectively. The convergence of the search solutions in the NCA was also accelerated by the random, adaptive parameters and hyperbolic function. A set of 68 test benchmark functions with (30, 100, 500, and 1000) dimensions was used to examine the NCA's effectiveness in terms of exploration, exploitation, local optimality avoidance, population fitness enhancement, and convergence rate. Firstly, the proposed NCA's behaviour is examined using a collection of 23 standard well-known benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimensional functions. Secondly, the proposed NCA's superiority is examined using the IEEE CEC-2015 and IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark suites. In addition to qualitatively examine NCA's superiority over other metaheuristics, Friedman and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests are performed. In terms of performance metrics, NCA ranked first. For application perspective, the NCA is tested on eight real-world constrained and unconstrained engineering design problems from IEEE CEC-2020 real-world optimization benchmark suits. The NCA algorithm's performance on benchmark functions and engineering design problems indicates that it can handle constrained and uncertain search spaces in real-world scenarios. The source code of the NCA algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/Shivankur07/Numeric-Crunch-Algorithm.git.

TI CoDF-Net: coordinated-representation decision fusion network for emotion

   Multi-modal emotion recognition; Multi-modal fusion; Affective computing
AB Physiological signals, such as EEG and eye movements, have emerged as promising research topics in emotion recognition due to their inherent advantages of objectivity, high recognition accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. However, most existing methods for fusing EEG and eye movement signals use concatenation or weighted summation, which may lead to information loss and limited ability to resist noise. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a Coordinated-representation Decision Fusion Network (CoDF-Net) to efficiently fuse the representation of EEG and eye movement signals. Specifically, CoDF-Net first learns personalized information by maximizing the correlation between modalities. Next, the Decision-level Fusion Broad Learning System (DF-BLS) is developed to construct multiple sub-systems to obtain the final emotional states via the effective decision-making mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments are designed on two public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has superior emotion recognition performance over traditional approaches and current state-of-the-art methods. The CoDF-Net achieves 94.09 and 91.62% in the subject-dependent setting and 87.04 and 83.87% in the subject-independent setting on the SEED-CHN and SEED-GER datasets, respectively. Moreover, it is found that the proposed method exhibits a more significant ability to resist noise by adding Gaussian noise with different standard deviations.

AB Electricity is vital in daily life and crucial for sustainable economic development. Accurate forecasting of energy consumption ensures efficient electricity system operation and supports strategic decision-making for energy distribution. Current time-series methods neglect the influence of neighboring regions' electricity consumption and the varying impact levels caused by multiple factors on the target area. Therefore, we propose the k-nearest neighbor attentive deep autoregressive network (KNNA-DeepAR) model, which combines a k-nearest neighbor approach with an attentive deep autoregressive network, to achieve precise short-term electricity consumption predictions. By extracting informative features from historical time-series data, we incorporate electricity consumption data from the k regions closest to the target area as additional variables. Leveraging the attention mechanism, we assign varying weights to each variable to capture their interdependencies. Experimental results on a public dataset of electricity loads in fourteen U.S. regions demonstrate the superiority of our model. Compared to state-of-the-art time-series models, our model achieves higher predictive accuracy and exhibits significant potential as an effective approach for accurately predicting electricity consumption and other time-series tasks.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Market demands for high-tech products constantly evolve by product specification. To be competitive, a production system must be flexible and reconfigurable when facing mass customization. Flexible assembly line (FAL) enables mixed production with high efficiency. One example is graphic processing unit (GPU) cards. FAL requires comprehensive system design and scheduling to fully utilize the resources. This study adopts agent-based simulation (ABS) modelling for a FAL because of the abilities of ABS in flexibility and scalability. The proposed framework consists of three parts: real environment, virtual environment, and evaluation and analysis. This study uses agent-based simulation modelling to elaborate on sequencing and scheduling performances in the GPU-card assembly line. The Pareto frontier analysis is conducted to resolve conflicts between part tardiness and throughput.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ALLOCATION
AB This study constructs a distributed generation (DG) multi-objective hierarchical optimal planning model. A solution method is proposed based on an improved beluga whale optimization algorithm (IBWO). Reasonable planning of the location and capacity of DG access to the distribution network plays an important role in minimizing actual power losses, reducing grid operating costs, and improving voltage distribution. The output power of DG has uncertainties and the demand response on the load side can also affect the DG planning; however, previous studies have ignored these two critical factors. This study aims to determine the optimal location and capacity of DG access to distribution network considering the demand response and the uncertainty of DG output power to improve the economic benefit, power quality and energy utilization efficiency. This study proposes an IBWO algorithm with better performance, aiming at the multi-objective, multi-constrained and nonlinear DG planning problem and a DG multi-objective hierarchical optimal planning model is established. The results show that proposed method can reduce the annual comprehensive cost, total voltage deviation and power loss of system by 11.66%, 40.55% and 38.61%.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS; RANDOM-WALKS; COMPLEXITY; KERNELS
AB In this paper, we propose a novel framework of computing the Quantum-based Entropic Representations (QBER) for un-attributed graphs, through the Continuous-time Quantum Walk (CTQW). To achieve this, we commence by transforming each original graph into a family of k-level neighborhood graphs, where each k -level neighborhood graph encapsulates the connected information between each vertex and its k-hop neighbor vertices, providing a fine representation to reflect the multi-level topological information for the original global graph structure. To further capture the complicated structural characteristics of the original graph through its neighborhood graphs, we propose to characterize the structure of each neighborhood graph with the Average Mixing Matrix (AMM) of the CTQW, that encapsulates the time-averaged behavior of the CTQW evolved on the neighborhood graph. More specifically, we show how the AMM matrix allows us to compute a Quantum Shannon Entropy for each vertex, and thus compute an entropic signature for each neighborhood graph by measuring the averaged value or the Jensen-Shannon Divergence between the entropies of its vertices. For each original graph, the resulting QBER is defined by gauging how the entropic signat ures vary on its k-level neighborhood graphs with increasing k, reflecting the multi-dimensional entropy-based structure information of the original graph. Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QBER approach in terms of the classification accuracies. The proposed approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art entropic complexity measuring methods, graph kernel methods, as well as graph deep learning methods.

DE Few-shot classification; Generalization error bound; Self-supervised
   learning; Knowledge distillation
AB Recently, transfer learning has generated promising performance in few-shot classification by pre-training a backbone network on base classes and then applying it to novel classes. Nevertheless, there lacks a theoretical analysis on how to reduce the generalization error during the learning process. To fill this gap, we prove that the classification error bound on novel classes is mainly determined by the base-class generalization error, given the base-novel domain divergence and the novel-class generalization error produced by an incremental learner using novel samples. The novel-class generalization error is further decided by the base-class empirical error and the VC-dimension of the hypothesis space. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a Born Again Networks under Self-supervised Label Augmentation (BANs-SLA) method to improve the generalization capability of classifiers. In this method, cross-entropy and supervised contrastive losses are simultaneously used to minimize the base-class empirical error in the expanded space with SLA. Afterward, BANs are adopted to transfer the knowledge sequentially across generations, which acts as an effective regularizer to trade-off the VC-dimension. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of our method, which establishes the new state-of-the-art performance on popular few-shot classification benchmark datasets.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB The discovery of frequent closed high utility itemsets (FCHUIs) and frequent generators of high utility itemsets (FGHUIs) is significant because they serve as important and concise representations of frequent high utility itemsets (FHUIs), offering a brief but essential summary that can be considerably smaller. Besides, they facilitate the generation of nonredundant high utility association rules that are crucial for decision-makers. However, the challenge lies in the difficulty of mining these representations due to scalability issues, high memory usage, and long runtimes, particularly when dealing with dense and large datasets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach for efficiently mining FCHUIs and FGHUIs using a novel weak lower bound named wlbu on the utility. The approach includes effective pruning strategies for early eliminating non-closed and/or non-generator high utility branches in the prefix search tree based on wlbu. These pruning strategies allow faster execution with lower memory usage. In addition, the paper presents two novel algorithms, FCGHUI-Miner and FGHUI-Miner, which can simultaneously discover both FGHUIs and FCHUIs or solely mine FGHUIs, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

AB Although non-interpretable (black-box) deep learning models are well known for their accuracy, interpretable deep learning models should be used for high stake decisions, such as: healthcare. In this paper, we present a novel technique of combining the existing state-of-the-art models, and using them as a base model to build an interpretable deep learning model Comb-ProtoPNet. In contrast to usual technique of combining the logits of two (or more) algorithms to form an ensemble algorithm, we combine the algorithms themselves. Our proposed interpretable model applies a prototype layer on top of the convolutional layers of an ensemble base model. We trained and tested our algorithm over the dataset of chest CT-scan images of COVID-19 patients, pneumonia patients and normal people. The use of a certain combination of blocks from two different state-of-the-art models (statistically) significantly improved the accuracy compared to the individual use of the state-of-the-art models as the base models, and this is where the part of the title "One and one make eleven" comes from.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID RESTORATION
AB Fundus photography is prone to suffer from image quality degradation that impacts clinical examination performed by ophthalmologists or intelligent systems. Though enhancement algorithms have been developed to promote fundus observation on degraded images, high data demands and limited applicability hinder their clinical deployment. To circumvent this bottleneck, a generic fundus image enhancement network (GFE-Net) is developed in this study to robustly correct unknown fundus images without supervised or extra data. Levering image frequency information, self-supervised representation learning is conducted to learn robust structure-aware representations from degraded images. Then with a seamless architecture that couples representation learning and image enhancement, GFE-Net can accurately correct fundus images and meanwhile preserve retinal structures. Comprehensive experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of GFE-Net. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, GFE-Net achieves superior performance in data dependency, enhancement performance, deployment efficiency, and scale generalizability. Follow-up fundus image analysis is also facilitated by GFE-Net, whose modules are respectively verified to be effective for image enhancement.

AB Augmented Reality (AR) is considered to be a promising technology for the guidance of laparoscopic liver surgery. By overlaying pre-operative 3D information of the liver and internal blood vessels on the laparoscopic view, surgeons can better understand the location of critical structures. In an effort to enable AR, several authors have focused on the development of methods to obtain an accurate alignment between the laparoscopic video image and the pre-operative 3D data of the liver, without assessing the benefit that the resulting overlay can provide during surgery. In this paper, we present a study that aims to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the value of an AR overlay in laparoscopic surgery during a simulated surgical task on a phantom setup. We design a study where participants are asked to physically localise pre-operative tumours in a liver phantom using three image guidance conditions - a baseline condition without any image guidance, a condition where the 3D surfaces of the liver are aligned to the video and displayed on a black background, and a condition where video see-through AR is displayed on the laparoscopic video. Using data collected from a cohort of 24 participants which include 12 surgeons, we observe that compared to the baseline, AR decreases the median localisation error of surgeons on non-peripheral targets from 25.8 mm to 9.2 mm. Using subjective feedback, we also identify that AR introduces usability improvements in the surgical task and increases the perceived confidence of the users. Between the two tested displays, the majority of participants preferred to use the AR overlay instead of navigated view of the 3D surfaces on a separate screen. We conclude that AR has the potential to improve performance and decision making in laparoscopic surgery, and that improvements in overlay alignment accuracy and depth perception should be pursued in the future.

AB The impressive recent performance of large language models has led many to wonder to what extent they can serve as models of general intelligence or are similar to human cognition. We address this issue by applying GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to a classic problem in human inductive reasoning known as property induction. Over two experiments, we elicit human judgments on a range of property induction tasks spanning multiple domains. Although GPT-3.5 struggles to capture many aspects of human behavior, GPT-4 is much more successful: for the most part, its performance qualitatively matches that of humans, and the only notable exception is its failure to capture the phenomenon of premise non-monotonicity. Our work demonstrates that property induction allows for interesting comparisons between human and machine intelligence and provides two large datasets that can serve as benchmarks for future work in this vein.

AB The sharply growing volume of time series data due to recent sensing technology advancement poses emerging challenges to the data transfer speed and storage as well as corresponding energy consumption. To tackle the overwhelming volume of time series data in transmission and storage, compressing time series, which encodes time series into smaller size representations while enables authentic restoration of compressed ones with minimizing the reconstruction error, has attracted significant attention. Numerous methods have been developed and recent deep learning ones with minimal assumptions on data characteristics, such as recurrent autoencoders, have shown themselves to be competitive. Yet, capturing long-term dependencies in time series compression is a signifi-cant challenge calling further development. To make a response, this paper proposes a temporal convolutional recurrent autoencoder framework for more effective time series compression. First, two autoencoder modules, the temporal convolutional network encoder with a recurrent neural network decoder (TCN-RNN) and the temporal convolutional network encoder with an attention assisted recurrent neural network decoder (TCN-ARNN), are developed. The TCN-RNN employs only the recurrent neural network decoder to reconstruct the time series in reverse order. In contrast, the TCN-ARNN uses two recurrent neural networks to reconstruct the time series in both forward and reverse order in parallel. In addition, a timestep-wise attention network is developed to incorporate the forward and reverse reconstructions into the ultimate reconstruction with adaptive weights. Finally, a model selection procedure is developed to adaptively select between the TCN-RNN and TCN-ARNN based on their reconstruction performance on the validation dataset. Computational experiments on five datasets show that the proposed temporal convolutional recurrent autoencoder outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarking models in terms of lower reconstruction errors with the same compression ratio, achieving an improvement of up to 45.14% in the average of mean squared errors. Results indicate a promising potential of the proposed temporal convolutional recurrent autoencoder on the time series compression for various applications involving long time series data.

AB In the context of a resilient energy system, accurate residential load forecasting has become a non-trivial requirement for ensuring effective management and planning strategy/policy development. Due to the highly stochastic nature of energy load profiles, it is difficult to predict accurately, and usually, predictions are error-prone. This paper explores the potential of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) in simplifying the dynamics of complex demand profiles. The simplified components are then embedded within a deep learning model, specifically Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to forecast short-term residential loads. The novel modelling framework integrates Bayesian optimisation strategy, feature decomposition technique, feature engineering phase, and percentile-based bias correction algorithm to enhance model accuracy. The model is developed using a case-study residential dwelling located in Fintry (Scotland), and the model performance is assessed over four forecast horizons. The overall efficiency of framework is also investigated for three algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), and an LSTM network. While EMD and feature engineering were found to greatly improve prediction accuracy, the number of IMFs used was shown to significantly impact the model's performance and computational complexity. The model was tested on two further case studies from Fintry.

TI Counterfactual explanations for misclassified images: How human and

ID BLACK-BOX
AB Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular solution for the eXplainable AI (XAI) problem of elucidating the predictions of black-box deep-learning systems because people easily understand them, they apply across different problem domains and seem to be legally compliant. Although over 100 counterfactual methods exist in the XAI literature, each claiming to generate plausible explanations akin to those preferred by people, few of these methods have actually been tested on users (similar to 7%). Even fewer studies adopt a user-centered perspective; for instance, asking people for their counterfactual explanations to determine their perspective on a "good explanation". This gap in the literature is addressed here using a novel methodology that (i) gathers human-generated counterfactual explanations for misclassified images, in two user studies and, then, (ii) compares these human-generated explanations to computationally-generated explanations for the same misclassifications. Results indicate that humans do not "minimally edit" images when generating counterfactual explanations. Instead, they make larger, "meaningful" edits that better approximate prototypes in the counterfactual class. An analysis based on "explanation goals" is proposed to account for this divergence between human and machine explanations. The implications of these proposals for future work are discussed.

AB Tandem solar cells are a key technology for exceeding the theoretical efficiency limit of single-junction cells. One of the most promising combinations is the silicon-perovskite tandem cells, considering their potential for high efficiency, fabrication on a large scale, and low cost. While most research focuses on improving each subcell, another key challenge lies in the tunnel junction that connects these subcells, significantly impacting the overall cell characteristics. Here, we demonstrate the first use of tunnel junctions using a stack of p+/n+ polysilicon passivating contacts deposited directly on the tunnel oxide to overcome the drawbacks of conventional metal oxide-based tunnel junctions, including low tunneling efficiency and sputter damage. Using Random Forest analysis, we achieved high implied open circuit voltages over 700 mV and low contact resistivities of 500 m omega cm2, suggesting fill factor losses of less than 1% abs for the operating conditions of a tandem cell.

AB Image stitching is an important way to achieve large-field high-resolution imaging. The inconsistencies in brightness and structure and defects in ghosting, blurring and misalignment between images, which are inevitable and difficult to eliminate, make a challenge to image stitching, due to the external lighting environment and changes in camera pose and parameters. Here, a novel method is proposed to search for the optimal seamline based on the fast marching method, which can stitch large parallax images with high quality. A feature weight map is first formed based on the similarity in colour, edge, texture and saliency of the images. Then it is used as the cost value of the seamline to search for the optimal seamline by fast marching method. The results show that this new method is more efficient to reduce defects, such as ghosting, misalignment and chromatic aberration, and realize high quality image stitching compared with traditional stitching tools and methods, which provides a new perspective for image stitching technology.

AB Particle swarm optimization algorithms are often applied to solve optimization problems. However, the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm has a single search method and is less capable of exploration and exploitation when solving high-dimensional and complex problems. In this paper, a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for marine predators (HMPPSO) is proposed by combining the multi-stage search strategy of marine predators algorithm (MPA). We divide the search process of HMPPSO into three stages: the first stage uses Brownian motion for exploration; the middle stage divides the population into two parts, the first half remains responsible for exploration through Brownian motion. Besides, in the second half of the population, a random wandering strategy is proposed to randomly select five particles so that it can control the update of particles to prevent falling into the local optimal solution; the learning strategy is improved in the later stage. The control parameters are used to adjust the strategy, while making the single case learning method and the example averaging method alternate. This strategy accelerates the convergence of the algorithm while enhancing the diversity of the algorithm in the later stage and improving the development ability of the algorithm. In addition, the population diversity is enhanced using chaotic initialization and opposition-based learning strategies. The algorithm in this paper is applied to different types of CEC2017 benchmark test functions and four multi-dimensional non-linear structural design optimization problems. Compared with other recent algorithms, the results show that the performance of HMPPSO is significantly better than other algorithms.

ID QUALITY PREDICTION
AB Data-driven soft sensors have been widely used in manufacturing processes for product quality prediction. However, in engineering practice, traditional linear soft sensors are considered to be insufficient when the manufacturing processes present high dimensionality as well as strong nonlinearity and dynamics. Moreover, due to the economic and technical limitations, missing data problem is widespread, which affects the generalization and accuracy of soft sensors. To overcome these issues, a missing manufacturing process data imputation framework is presented for nonlinear dynamic soft sensor modeling with the purpose of quality prediction. Specifically, the generate adversarial imputation network is introduced for data imputation, and the loss functions of discriminator and generator are reasonably designed. Subsequently, a mix gated unit combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit with bidirectional minimal gated unit is proposed for nonlinear dynamic soft sensor modeling aiming at improving the performance of quality prediction. Finally, the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed framework are demonstrated through a representative manufacturing process, the hot rolling process, in which the percentages of missing data are simulated from 20% to 80%. The ideal performance indicators, root mean square error and mean absolute error, have been obtained. It can be shown that the proposed framework can provide better prediction accuracy than the competitive methods in each scenario.

AB Recent research has shown that facial expressions and body gestures are two significant implications in identifying human emotions. However, these studies mainly focus on contextual information of adjacent frames, and rarely explore the spatio-temporal relationships between distant or global frames. In this paper, we revisit the facial expression and body gesture emotion recognition problems, and propose to improve the performance of video emotion recognition by extracting the spatio-temporal features via further encoding temporal information. Specifically, for facial expression, we propose a super image-based spatio-temporal convolutional model (SISTCM) and a two-stream LSTM model to capture the local spatio-temporal features and learn global temporal cues of emotion changes. For body gestures, a novel representation method and an attention-based channel-wise convolutional model (ACCM) are introduced to learn key joints features and independent characteristics of each joint. Extensive experiments on five common datasets are carried out to prove the superiority of the proposed method, and the results proved learning two visual information leads to significant improvement over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

   Density map regression
AB Automatically counting fish in sonar images has been attracting increasing attention in recent years because extreme efforts are needed in manual counting. Density map regression provides a promising approach in the counting field, but two obstacles are placed in front of fish counting in low resolution sonar images: the difficulty in distinguishing fish from the similar background noise and the inconsistency between the strip-shaped fishes in input images and dot-shaped ground truth density map. To address these issues, we present GPNet, a novel encoder-decoder network with global attention and point supervision, to boost sonar image-based fish counting accuracy. To alleviate the impact of background noise, we incorporate a segmentation module (SM) with global self-attention to the neck of the network to identify the fish region and space out background noise. Furthermore, feature enhancement modules (FEM) with a global receptive field are introduced to the encoder to enhance the feature representation and discrimination. To break down the performance upper bound resulting from target shape inconsistency between input and ground truth, we leverage fish center coordinates instead of the Gaussian density map to supervise the network training directly. Extensive experiments on a challenging public sonar image-based fish counting dataset, the ARIS dataset, demonstrate that GPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance both in counting accuracy and noise removal.

AB Many challenging real-world problems require the deployment of ensembles - multiple complementary learning models - to reach acceptable performance levels. While effective, applying the entire ensemble to every sample is costly and often unnecessary. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a cost-effective alternative, where detectors are dynamically chosen based on the output of their predecessors, with their usefulness weighted against their computational cost. Despite their potential, DRL-based solutions are not widely used in ensemble management. This can be attributed to the difficulties in configuring the reward function for each new task, the unpredictable reactions of the DRL agent to changes in the data, and the inability to use common performance metrics (e.g., True and False-Positive Rates, TPR/FPR) to guide the DRL model in a multi-objective environment. In this study, we propose methods for fine-tuning and calibrating DRL-based policies to meet multiple performance goals. Moreover, we present a method for transferring effective security policies from one dataset to another. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is highly robust against adversarial attacks.

AB The primary objective of this study is to establish and introduce generalized symmetric type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy set, a type-2 fuzzy set extension. The major goal of such an extension is to enable the concept of fuzzy outranking relation which is known as foot print of uncertainty (FOU) to be employed in generalized symmetric type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy number (GST2IFN) for the first time. This is interesting to deal this GST2IFNs and it is complicated to find the equivalent crisp quantities due to this special structure. Hence, we have introduced a new ranking function using the mean level set of membership and non-membership functions. Besides, the arithmetic operations of the GST2IFNs are discussed. To express the effectiveness and application of the proposed GST2IF variables, a transportation problem (TP) is formulated with all cost parameters are GST2IFNs. In addition, few different algorithmic approaches are applied to find the initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) and optimal solution of the TP. Finally, the feasibility and richness of the obtained optimal solution is discussed.

AB Wall segmentation is a special case of semantic segmentation, and the task is to classify each pixel into one of two classes: wall and no-wall. The segmentation model returns a mask showing where objects like windows and furniture are located, as well as walls. This article proposes the module's structure for semantic segmentation of walls in 2D images, which can effectively address the problem of wall segmentation. The proposed model achieved higher accuracy and faster execution than other solutions. An encoder-decoder architecture of the segmentation module was used. Dilated ResNet50/101 network was used as an encoder, representing ResNet50/101 network in which dilated convolutional layers replaced the last convolutional layers. The ADE20K dataset subset containing only interior images, was used for model training, while only its subset was used for model evaluation. Three different approaches to model training were analyzed in the research. On the validation dataset, the best approach based on the proposed structure with the ResNet101 network resulted in an average accuracy at the pixel level of 92.13% and an intersection over union (IoU) of 72.58%. Moreover, all proposed approaches can be applied to recognize other objects in the image to solve specific tasks.

DE Disambiguation; Deduplication; Author name disambiguation
AB Scholarly knowledge graphs (SKG) are knowledge graphs representing research related information, powering discovery and statistics about research impact and trends. Author name disambiguation (AND) is required to produce high-quality SKGs, as a disambiguated set of authors is fundamental to ensure a coherent view of researchers' activity. Various issues, such as homonymy, scarcity of contextual information, and cardinality of the SKG, make simple name string matching insufficient or computationally complex. Many AND deep learning methods have been developed, and interesting surveys exist in the literature, comparing the approaches in terms of techniques, complexity, performance, etc. However, none of them specifically addresses AND methods in the context of SKGs, where the entity-relationship structure can be exploited. In this paper, we discuss recent graph-based methods for AND, define a framework through which such methods can be confronted, and catalog the most popular datasets and benchmarks used to test such methods. Finally, we outline possible directions for future work on this topic.

AB Classical backstepping control of fractional-order nonlinear systems (FONSs) needs to calculate fractional derivatives of virtual control inputs recursively, which usually results in the "explosion of complexity" problem. This article proposes a command-filtering adaptive control scheme based on fractional-order echo state networks (FOESNs) for strict-feedback uncertain FONSs. Finite-time command filters are introduced to estimate instead of calculating the complicated fractional-order derivatives of virtual control inputs, which not only has the advantages of the conventional command-filters, but also guarantees the finite-time convergent property. An FOESN with stronger approximation ability is presented to approach uncertainties. Compared with conventional adaptive neural network or fuzzy control, the proposed method with similar computational complexity has more design freedom and better approximation effect. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is verified by two simulation examples.

AB In the era of big data, data information has exploded, and all walks of life are impacted by big data. The arrival of big data provides the possibility for the realization of intelligent financial analysis of enterprises. At present, most enterprises' financial analysis and decision-making based on the analysis results are mainly based on human resources, with poor automation and obvious problems in efficiency and error. In order to help the senior management of enterprises to conduct scientific and effective management, the study uses big data web crawler technology and ETL technology to process data and build an intelligent financial decision support system integrating big data together with Internet plus platform. J Group in S Province is taken as an example to study the effect before and after the application of intelligent financial decision support system. The results show that the crawler technology can monitor the basic data and the big data in the industry in real time, and improve the accuracy of decision-making. Through the intelligent financial decision support system which integrates big data, the core indexes such as profit, net asset return, and accounts receivable of the enterprises can be clearly displayed. The system can query the causes of financial changes hidden behind the financial data. Through the intelligent financial decision support system, it is found that the asset liability ratio, current assets growth rate, operating income growth rate, and financial expenses of J Group are 55.27, 10.38, 20.28%, and 1,974 million RMB, respectively. The growth rate of real sales income of J Group is 0.63%, which is 31.27% less than the excellent value of the industry 31.90%. After adopting the intelligent financial decision support system, the monthly financial statements of the enterprises increase significantly, and the monthly report analysis time decreases. The maximum number of financial statements received by the Group per month is 332, and the processing time at this time is only 2 h. According to the results, it can be seen that the intelligent financial decision support system integrating big data as the research result can effectively improve the financial management level of enterprises, improve the usefulness of financial decision-making, and make practical contributions to the field of corporate financial decision-making.

AB Many real-world cooperative problems can be implemented using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques, such as urban traffic control or multi-role games. However, the policy learning of MARL algorithms contains features of long-trajectory training and partial observability, which leads to the sparsity of reward and the lack of decision information. To solve the above issues, this article studies hierarchical deep MARL and proposes a novel model named Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Communication Network (HSTCN). HSTCN designs hierarchical policies with two-time granularities: high-level and low-level policies. All agents are jointly entered into a joint policy containing the above two policies, and each has its execution policy. Specifically, the high-level policy provides intrinsic goals and continuous reward samples for the low-level policy to alleviate reward sparsity. The Low-level policy absorbs the above information to improve the efficiency of the agents' execution policies and interact with the environment to optimize the next reward. What's more, the high-level policy designs a graph-like structural model with Spatio-Temporal abstract. The Spatio-Temporal model expands receptive fields to receive neighborhood information and facilitates learning more robust policies by capturing the underlying graph's spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, an evaluation network is added to increase the robustness. Empirically, we demonstrated the effectiveness of HSTCN in a long-trajectory training environment through Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), while StarCraft II maps are tested as abstract environment. The above experimental results prove that the performance of HSTCN is superior to other advanced algorithms and verify the rationality of HSTCN design.

AB This work presents a human memory augmentation system that uses augmented reality (AR), computer vision (CV), and artificial intelligence to replace the internal mental representation of objects in the environment with an external augmented representation. The system consists of two components: 1) an AR headset; and 2) a computing station. The AR headset runs an application that senses the indoor environment, sends data to the computing station for processing, receives the processed data, and updates the external representation of objects using a virtual 3-D object projected into the real environment in front of the user's eyes. The computing station performs CV-based indoor environment self-localization, object detection, and object-to-location binding using first-person view data received from the AR headset. We designed a behavioral study to evaluate the usability of the system. In a pilot study with 26 participants (12 females and 14 males), we investigated human performance in an experimental task that involved remembering the positions of objects in a physical space and displaying the positions of the learned objects on the 2-D map of the space. We conducted the studies under two conditions-that is, with and without using the AR system. We investigated the usability of the system, subjective workload, and performance variables under both conditions. The results showed that the AR-based augmentation of the mental representation of objects indoors reduced cognitive load and increased performance accuracy.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs), an important family of neuroscience-oriented intelligent models, play an essential role in the neuromorphic computing community. Spike rate coding and temporal coding are the mainstream coding schemes in the current modeling of SNNs. However, rate coding usually suffers from limited representation resolution and long latency, while temporal coding usually suffers from under-utilization of spike activities. To this end, we propose spike attention coding (SAC) for SNNs. By introducing learnable attention coefficients for each time step, our coding scheme can naturally unify rate coding and temporal coding, and then flexibly learn optimal coefficients for better performance. Several normalization and regularization techniques are further incorporated to control the range and distribution of the learned attention coefficients. Extensive experiments on classification, generation, and regression tasks are conducted and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed coding scheme.

AB The effective modal fusion and perception between the language and the image are necessary for inferring the reference instance in the referring image segmentation (RIS) task. In this article, we propose a novel RIS network, the global and local interactive perception network (GLIPN), to enhance the quality of modal fusion between the language and the image from the local and global perspectives. The core of GLIPN is the global and local interactive perception (GLIP) scheme. Specifically, the GLIP scheme contains the local perception module (LPM) and the global perception module (GPM). The LPM is designed to enhance the local modal fusion by the correspondence between word and image local semantics. The GPM is designed to inject the global structured semantics of images into the modal fusion process, which can better guide the word embedding to perceive the whole image's global structure. Combined with the local-global context semantics fusion, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed GLIPN over most state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Visual affordance grounding aims to segment all possible interaction regions between people and objects from an image/video, which benefits many applications, such as robot grasping and action recognition. Prevailing methods predominantly depend on the appearance feature of the objects to segment each region of the image, which encounters the following two problems: 1) there are multiple possible regions in an object that people interact with and 2) there are multiple possible human interactions in the same object region. To address these problems, we propose a hand-aided affordance grounding network (HAG-Net) that leverages the aided clues provided by the position and action of the hand in demonstration videos to eliminate the multiple possibilities and better locate the interaction regions in the object. Specifically, HAG-Net adopts a dual-branch structure to process the demonstration video and object image data. For the video branch, we introduce hand-aided attention to enhance the region around the hand in each video frame and then use the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to aggregate the action features. For the object branch, we introduce a semantic enhancement module (SEM) to make the network focus on different parts of the object according to the action classes and utilize a distillation loss to align the output features of the object branch with that of the video branch and transfer the knowledge in the video branch to the object branch. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two challenging datasets show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art results for affordance grounding.

AB Recent years have seen the successful application of large pretrained models of source code (CodePTMs) to code representation learning, which have taken the field of software engineering (SE) from task-specific solutions to task-agnostic generic models. By the remarkable results, CodePTMs are seen as a promising direction in both academia and industry. While a number of CodePTMs have been proposed, they are often not directly comparable because they differ in experimental setups such as pretraining dataset, model size, evaluation tasks, and datasets. In this article, we first review the experimental setup used in previous work and propose a standardized setup to facilitate fair comparisons among CodePTMs to explore the impacts of their pretraining tasks. Then, under the standardized setup, we re-pretrain CodePTMs using the same model architecture, input modalities, and pretraining tasks, as they declared and fine-tune each model on each evaluation SE task for evaluating. Finally, we present the experimental results and make a comprehensive discussion on the relative strength and weakness of different pretraining tasks with respect to each SE task. We hope our view can inspire and advance the future study of more powerful CodePTMs.

   network (GNN); intraclass and interclass neighbors
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability in modeling graphs; however, their performance would significantly degrade when there are noisy edges connecting nodes from different classes. To alleviate negative effect of noisy edges on neighborhood aggregation, some recent GNNs propose to predict the label agreement between node pairs within a single network. However, predicting the label agreement of edges across different networks has not been investigated yet. Our work makes the pioneering attempt to study a novel problem of cross-network homophilous and heterophilous edge classification (CNHHEC) and proposes a novel domain-adaptive graph attention-supervised network (DGASN) to effectively tackle the CNHHEC problem. First, DGASN adopts multihead graph attention network (GAT) as the GNN encoder, which jointly trains node embeddings and edge embeddings via the node classification and edge classification losses. As a result, label-discriminative embeddings can be obtained to distinguish homophilous edges from heterophilous edges. In addition, DGASN applies direct supervision on graph attention learning based on the observed edge labels from the source network, thus lowering the negative effects of heterophilous edges while enlarging the positive effects of homophilous edges during neighborhood aggregation. To facilitate knowledge transfer across networks, DGASN employs adversarial domain adaptation to mitigate domain divergence. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGASN achieves the state-of-the-art performance in CNHHEC.

ID TOTAL VARIATION REGULARIZATION; REMOVAL; MINIMIZATION; MODELS
AB Image restoration with impulse noise is an important task in image processing. Taking into account the statistical distribution of impulse noise, the l(1)-norm data fidelity and total variation (l(1)TV) model has been widely used in this area. However, the l(1)TV model usually performs worse when the noise level is high. To overcome this drawback, several nonconvex models have been proposed. In this paper, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve nonconvex models arising in impulse noise. Compared to existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm is a completely explicit algorithm in which every subproblem has a closed-form solution. The key idea is to transform the original nonconvex models into an equivalent constrained minimization problem with two separable objective functions, where one is differentiable but nonconvex. As a consequence, the proximal linearized alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to solve it. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

DE Information extraction; Chinese event detection; Mesh transformer;
   Entity knowledge
AB Chinese event detection (CED) often suffers from the problem of word-trigger mismatches due to the absence of natural delimiters in Chinese sentences. Recently many neural network models have been proposed to solve this problem by learning both character-level and word-level representation, however, their performance is limited by the insufficient ability of capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Mesh Transformer to model character-word interaction for the CED task. The Mesh Transformer has three kinds of nodes: character nodes, word nodes and a relay node. Compared with the fully-connected standard Transformer, each character node interacts with its neighboring character nodes and its self-matched word nodes to capture local semantic information in the Mesh Transformer. Additionally, the relay node is connected to each character node and word node, where long-range dependencies can be captured by a two-step update. Furthermore, entity knowledge is utilized to deal with the label confusion problem by improving the capability of modeling semantic representation. Experiment results on the ACE 2005 Chinese dataset show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than the peer and state-of-the-art ones in terms of F1-score on both trigger identification and trigger classification.

ID REPLACEMENT STRATEGIES
AB This paper deals with a variation of the knapsack problem called the quadratic bottleneck knapsack problem (QBKP). In QBKP, there is a quadratic cost associated with each pair of objects and the objective is to minimize the maximum quadratic cost such that sumtotal of weights of objects should be at least equal to the capacity of knapsack. Despite the practical application of this NP-hard problem in selecting investments for a portfolio, it remains an under-studied problem as only a few exact and heuristic approaches exist in the literature. This has motivated us to develop a metaheuristic approach based on steady-state genetic algorithm (SSGA) for the QBKP. Our SSGA approach uses worst among most similar replacement strategy to preserve useful population diversity which has a significant impact on the performance of our algorithm. Further, our crossover and mutation operators are designed as per the characteristics of the QBKP. We have experimentally compared the performance of our proposed approach with those available in the literature and clearly demonstrated our approach to be better.

ID SUPERRESOLUTION; ENHANCEMENT
AB The demand for high-resolution videos has been consistently rising across various domains, propelled by continuous advancements in societal. Nonetheless, limitations in imaging and economic factors often result in obtaining low-resolution images. The currently available space-time video super-resolution methods often fail to fully exploit the information existing within the spatio-temporal domain. To address this problem, the issue is tackled by conceptualizing the input low-resolution video as a cuboid structure. An innovative methodology called "Cuboid-Net", which incorporates a multi-branch convolutional neural network, is introduced. Cuboid-Net is designed to collectively enhance the spatial and temporal resolutions of videos, enabling the extraction of rich and meaningful information across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically, the input video is taken as a cuboid to generate different directional slices as input for different branches of the network. The proposed network contains four modules, that is, a multi-branch-based hybrid feature extraction module, a multi-branch-based reconstruction module, a first-stage quality enhancement module, and a second-stage cross frame quality enhancement module for interpolated frames only. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is not only effective for spatial and temporal super-resolution of video but also for spatial and angular super-resolution of light field.
   A multi-branch convolutional neural network (Cuboid-Net) for joint space-time video super resolution is proposed. Specifically, the input video is taken as a cuboid to generate different directional slices as input for different branches of the network.image

DE image processing; image watermarking; signal processing
AB Blind watermark extraction in discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain has a wide application prospect as well as a challenging subject. The imperceptibility of watermark signal makes watermark extraction a weak signal reception issue in essence. For DCT coefficients of host image generally disobey Gaussian distribution, at which the performance of linear correlated reception is no longer optimal. Aiming at this, a novel blind watermark extraction scheme combining the uncorrelated reception with adaptive bistable stochastic resonance (ABSR) technique is proposed. First, by block DCT transformation for host image, an additive watermark embedding algorithm is introduced, in which the watermarked image can be converted to one dimensional time domain weak signal (binary watermark image) reception under additive Laplacian noise (selected DCT coefficients). On this basis, through the key technology research on quantitatively cooperative resonance relationship under Laplacian noise, the ABSR system can be implemented by bistable system parameters self-adaptive adjustment, in which the ABSR system output signal will be enhanced rather than be weakened by random noise. Finally, the ABSR-based watermark extraction scheme is investigated, and both the visual effect, bit error ratio performance and robustness of proposed scheme are testified to be superior to that of traditional uncorrelated extraction.
   A novel blind watermark extraction scheme combining the uncorrelated reception with adaptive bistable stochastic resonance (ABSR) technique is proposed, the advantage of the ABSR technique, i.e. noise assisted signal transmission, is well represented in blind watermark extraction. It testifies both the visual effect, bit error ratio performance and robustness of the ABSR-based watermark extraction scheme are testified to be superior to that of traditional uncorrelated extraction.image

ID MODEL
AB The current technology of foundation pit deformation measurement is inefficient, and its accuracy is not ideal. Therefore, an intelligent prediction model of foundation pit deformation based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed to predict the foundation pit deformation intelligently, with high accuracy and efficiency, so as to improve the safety of the project. Firstly, to address the shortcomings of BPNNs, which rely on the initial parameter settings and tend to fall into local optimum and unstable performance, this study adopts the modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) to optimise the parameters of BPNNs and constructs a pit deformation prediction model based on the MPSO-BP algorithm to achieve predictive measurements of pit deformation. After training and testing the data samples, the results show that the prediction accuracy of the MPSO-BP pit deformation prediction model is 99.76%, which is 2.25% higher than that of the particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) pit deformation prediction model and 3.01% higher than that of the BP pit deformation prediction model. The aforementioned results show that the MPSO-BP pit deformation prediction model proposed in this study can effectively predict the pit deformation variables of construction projects and provide data support for the protective measures of the staff, which is helpful for the cause of construction projects in China.

AB Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, due to differences in imaging modalities and imaging devices, known as domain shift, the segmentation performance of deep learning models lacks reliability. In this paper, we propose a two-stage progressive unsupervised domain adaptation network (TSP-UDANet) to reduce domain shift when segmenting cardiac images from various sources. We alleviate the domain shift between the feature distribution of the source and target domains by introducing an intermediate domain as a bridge. The TSP-UDANet consists of three sub-networks: a style transfer sub-network, a segmentation sub-network, and a self-training sub-network. We conduct cooperative alignment of different domains at image level, feature level, and output level. Specifically, we transform the appearance of images across domains and enhance domain invariance by adversarial learning in multiple aspects to achieve unsupervised segmentation of the target modality. We validate the TSP-UDANet on the MMWHS (unpaired MRI and CT images), MS-CMRSeg (cross-modality MRI images), and M & Ms (cross-vendor MRI images) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate excellent segmentation performance and generalizability for unlabeled target modality images.

AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common retinal complication led by diabetes over the years, considered a cause of vision loss. Its timely identification is crucial to prevent blindness, requiring expert humans to analyze digital color fundus images. Hence, it is a time-consuming and expensive process. In this study, we propose a model named Attention-DenseNet for detecting and severity grading of DR. We apply a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract features and get a hierarchical representation of color fundus images. What is essential for the correct diagnosis of DR is to recognize all the retinal lesions and discriminative regions. However, convolutional neural networks may overlook some tiny lesions of color fundus images. So, we use an attention model to solve this issue, which helps the model focus more on distinctive areas than others. We use APTOS 2019 dataset and fivefold cross-validation to assess the model's performance. The method achieves an overall accuracy of 98.44%, an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 99.55%, and quadratic weighted kappa of 96.88% for the detection task, and an overall accuracy of 83.69%, an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 97%, and quadratic weighted kappa of 89.26% for grading task. Our experimental results indicate that the model is superior to recent studies and can be suitable for DR classification in real life, especially for DR detection.

AB Emphatic temporal-difference (ETD) learning (Sutton et al. 2016) is a pioneering off-policy reinforcement learning method involving the use of the followon trace. The recently proposed gradient emphasis learning (GEM, Zhang et al. 2020) algorithm is used to fix the problems of unbounded variance and large emphasis approximation error introduced by the followon trace from the perspective of stochastic approximation. In this paper, we rethink GEM and introduce a novel generalized GEM(b) algorithm to learn the true emphasis. The key to the construction of the generalized GEM(b) algorithm is introducing a tunable hyperparameter b that is not necessarily the same as the discount factor c to the GEM operator. We then apply the emphasis estimated by the proposed GEM(b) algorithm to the value estimation gradient and the policy gradient, respectively, yielding the corresponding ETD variant for off-policy evaluation (OPE) and actor-critic algorithm for off-policy control. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms on the diagnostic linear OPE benchmark as well as classic control tasks with neural network function approximators.

AB Psychiatric diseases are very common worldwide, including schizophrenia (SZ) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early diagnosis is very important for medical intervention. Proper diagnosis of these diseases requires long-term observations and extensive testing to recognize their clinical features. These observations and tests may be subjective, expensive, incomplete, or inaccurate. EEG is a strong candidate for the diagnosis of diseases with the advantages of being noninvasive, based on findings, less costly and getting results in a short time. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based solution for the diagnosis of psychiatric diseases using a fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) and deep learning approach. Two different publicly available datasets were combined. SZ, AD and healthy controls (HC) were automatically multi-classified in experiment 1 and SZ and AD groups were classified in experiment 2. Features were extracted using the FWHT. The performances of support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, and bidirectional long-short-term memory (BLSTM) algorithms were compared for each experiment using the extracted features. In the experiments, the BLSTM algorithm displayed the best performance. The BLSTM algorithm demonstrated promising results with 91.05% overall accuracy, 0.86 kappa statistics in experiment 1, and with 98.38% overall accuracy, 0.96 kappa statistics in experiment 2. The results of the experiment provided evidence that people with different psychiatric diseases have different EEG signals. Moreover, it is a rare attempt that SZ, AD and HC groups can be classified automatically and effectively from EEG signals using deep learning model and accuracy was higher than related literature studies.

Furthermore, the controller design respects the structure of the equations so that we can characterize the stabilization by a limited controller action. Our proofs rely on the unified matrix-measure theory and the generalized Halanay inequality on time scales. We validate our theoretical results with several simulation examples on various time domains.

DE Virtual reality; Smart glove; Multimodal fusion; MR experiment
AB The value and significance of intelligent experiments have gained widespread consensus and formed an industry chain in the education field. However, the interaction issues in such systems have severely constrained their extensive application. These issues manifest in weak operational feedback, problems with traditional interactive devices such as obstructed views and inability to observe subtle experimental phenomena at close range. The most prominent challenge is the inability of existing virtual experiments to accurately perceive user intentions. Therefore, in response to the aforementioned challenging problems in intelligent experiment interaction tools, this paper proposes an overall approach to design a multimodal fusion perception-based Smart gloves system for middle school experiments. It adopts a combination of virtual and real experiments, utilizing the Smart gloves to facilitate the experiment process. The paper designs the hardware structure of the Smart gloves and proposes the YSA algorithm and ICAM algorithm to capture user multimodal intentions, constructing the MAG algorithm to achieve multimodal fusion comprehension of user intentions at the decision-making level. This enhances the system's ability to accurately comprehend and analyze user intentions, thereby strengthening the Smart gloves's intent understanding capability. Experimental results demonstrate that the designed Smart gloves can promptly infer users' experimental intentions and provide corresponding feedback. The experiments further indicate that the developed Smart gloves interaction tool exhibits unique advantages in addressing challenging technical issues faced by existing intelligent experiment tools and traditional data gloves, offering encouraging potential application prospects.

AB Ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry is widely used for gestational age prediction and abnormal fetal growth diagnosis. However, manual biometric measurements require time-consuming procedures and current automated measurement approaches remain challenging in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. This paper proposes deep learning-based efficient automatic fetal biometry measurement method for system-on-chip (SoC) solution. For end-to-end automated measurements, a hardware-friendly bilateral segmentation network (H-BiSeNet) was designed and optimized for multiple fetal objects (i.e., head, abdomen and femur), and fetal biometric parameters were then calculated with a robust multiple keypoint detection algorithm. For hardware implementation with a SoC, a deep learning processing unit (DPU) was employed to accelerate the proposed segmentation network, and biometric measurements with image pre-and postprocessing were conducted on an application processing unit (APU). A total of 6000 fetal ultrasound images in the three regions were collected from 2568 subjects, and the dataset was utilized to train the proposed network. In the performance evaluation, the proposed segmentation network with optimal quantization (H-BiSeNet-Q) outperformed other segmentation networks (i.e., U-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, DeepLabv3 + and BiSeNetv2) in terms of the average Dice coefficient, and automated measurements with H-BiSeNet-Q were highly correlated with manual measurements (r >= 0.983, p < 0.01 for all parameters, i.e., biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length). In the execution time analysis, H-BiSeNet-Q ran at 4.25 frames per second (FPS) with parallelism corresponding to 80% resource utilization in the SoC. These results showed feasibility in low-resource hardware settings such as portable ultrasound systems.

AB Algorithmic trading rules are widely used in financial markets as technical analysis tools for security trading. However, traditional trading rules are not sufficient to make a trading decision. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic trading method called CR-DQN, which incorporates deep Q-learning with two popular trading rules: moving average (MA) and trading range break-out (TRB). The input of deep Q-learning is combinational rule vectors, whose component is a linear combination of 140 rules produced by MA and TRB with different parameters. Due to non-stationary characteristics, we devise a reward driven combination weight updating scheme to generate combinational rule vectors, which can capture intrinsic features of financial data. Since the sparse reward exists in CR-DQN, we design a piecewise reward function which shows great potential in the experiments. Taking combinational rule vectors as input, the LSTM based Deep Q-learning network is used to learn an optimal algorithmic trading strategy. We apply our model to both Chinese and non-Chinese stock markets, and CR-DQN exhibits the best performance on a variety of evaluation criteria compared to many other approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Coffee is regarded as the highest consumed drink around the globe and has accounted as a major source of income in the regions where it is cultivated. To meet the coffee marketplace's requirements around the globe, cultivators must boost and analyze its cultivation and quality. Several factors like environmental changes and plant diseases are the major hindrance to increasing the yield of coffee. The development in the field of computer vision has facilitated the earliest diagnostic of diseased plant samples, however, the incidence of various image distortions i.e., color, light, size, orientation changes, and similarity in the healthy and diseased portions of examined samples are the major challenges in the effective recognition of various coffee plant leaf infections. The proposed work is focused to overwhelm the mentioned limitations by proposing a novel and effective DL model called the CoffeeNet. Explicitly, an improved CenterNet approach is proposed by introducing spatial-channel attention strategy-based ResNet-50 model for the computation of deep and disease-specific sample characteristics which are then classified by the 1-step detector of the CenterNet framework. We investigated the localization and cataloging outcomes of the suggested method on the Arabica coffee leaf repository which contains the images captured in the more realistic and complicated environmental constraints. The CoffeeNet model acquires a classification accuracy number of 98.54%, along with an mAP of 0.97 that is presenting the usefulness of our technique in localizing and categorizing various sorts of coffee plant leaf disorders.

AB This paper presents a new initialization method that combines adaptive visibility graphs and the A* algorithm to improve the exploration, accuracy, and computing efficiency of hybrid path planning for mobile robots. First, segments/links in the full visibility graphs are removed randomly in an iterative and adaptive manner, yielding adaptive visibility graphs. Then the A* algorithm is applied to find the shortest paths in these adaptive visibility graphs. Next, high-quality paths featuring low fitness values are chosen to initialize the subsequent heuristic optimization in hybrid path planning. Specifically, in the present study, the genetic algorithm (GA) is imple-mented on a CPU/GPU edge computing device (Jetson AGX Xavier) to exploit its massively parallel processing threads, and the strategy for judicious CPU/GPU resource utilization is also developed. Numerical experiments are conducted to determine proper hyperparameters and configure GA with balanced performance. Various optimal paths with differential consideration of practical factors for robot path planning are obtained by the proposed method. Compared to the other benchmark methods, ours significantly improves the diversity of initial path and exploration, optimization accuracy, and computing speed (within 5 s with most less than 2 s). Furthermore, real-time experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and application of the proposed algorithm on mobile robots.

AB Existing deep learning based methods have shown their advantages in multi-focus image fusion task. However, most methods still suffer from inaccurate focus region detection. In this paper, we employ the property of partwhole relationships embedded by the Capsule Network (CapsNet) to solve the problem. Specifically, we introduce CapsNet in multi-focus image fusion task, and design a structure-guided flow module, which fully utilizes structure information to help locate focus regions. CapsNet is introduced to extract structure features by supervising gradient information of the image. Compared with traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CapsNet takes into account the correlation of features from different positions, such that it encodes more compact features. Once structure features are obtained, a flow alignment module is introduced to learn flow field between structure and image features, and propagate effectively structure features to image features to make confident focus region detection. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves robust fusion performance on three publicly available multi-focus datasets, and outperforms or is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

DE Domain generalization; Fault diagnosis; Domain -invariant feature;
   Mutual learning; Unseen working conditions
AB Machinery fault diagnosis based on deep learning methods is cost-effective to guarantee safety and reliability of mechanical systems. Due to the variability of machinery working condition and difficulty of data obtaining under different health states, it is desirable to enhance the generalization capability to unseen working conditions for the fault diagnosis models trained by available data sets under limited number of working conditions. Considering that labeling industrial data is also a laborious work, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised domain generalization model, termed domain-invariant feature fusion networks (DIFFN) for intelligent fault diagnosis under unseen target working conditions. The main contributions are that, intra-domain-invariant features are considered to capture the intrinsic semantic information within the domain and are fused with inter-domaininvariant features to enhance the discrimination and generalization abilities in fault diagnosis. First, a domain-invariant representation learning method is established to learn the inter- and intra-domain-invariant features using two network branches and fuse them via a fusion module. Second, a mutual learning strategy is designed to enable the network branches and the fusion module to learn from each other, thereby improving the discrimination of the extracted features for accurate fault diagnosis. Lastly, a feature divergence maximization strategy is embedded between the two network branches to improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. Experiments on two bearing data sets demonstrate that the proposed model has better diagnostic accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain generalization methods, indicating its great potential for application in generalization fault diagnosis of machinery under unseen target working conditions.

ID LEARNING APPROACH
AB Artificial intelligence and deep learning have aided ocular disease through experiments including automatic illness recognition from images of the iris, fundus, or retina. Automated diagnosis systems (ADSs) provide services for the benefit of humanity and are essential in the early detection of harmful diseases. In fact, early detection is essential to avoid total blindness. In real life, several diagnostic tests such as visual ocular tonometry, retinal exam, and acuity test are performed, but they are conclusively time demanding and stressful for the patient. To consume time and detect the retinal disease earlier, an efficient prediction method is designed. In this proposed model, the first process is data collection that consists of a retinal disease dataset for testing and training. The second process is pre-processing, which executes image resizing and noise filter for feature extraction. The third step is feature extraction, which extracts the image's form, size, color, and texture for classification with CNN based on Inception-ResNet V2. The classification process is done by using the SVM with the extracted features. The prediction of diseases is classified such as normal, cataract, glaucoma, and retinal disease. The suggested model's performance is assessed using performance indicators such as accuracy, error, sensitivity, precision, and so forth. The suggested model's accuracy, error, sensitivity, and precision are 0.96, 0.962, 0.964, and 0.04, respectively, higher than existing techniques such as VGG16, Mobilenet V1, ResNet, and AlexNet. Thus, the proposed model instantly predicts retinal disease.

AB The traditional FER techniques have provided higher recognition accuracy during FER, but the utilization of memory storage size of the model is high, which may degrade the performance of the FER. In order to address these challenges, an adaptive occlusion-aware FER technique is introduced. The occlusion is significantly detected by employing convolutional neural network (CNN). The face inpainting is accomplished via generative adversarial network (GAN). Lastly, the facial expressions are determined using the patch-based adaptive residual network with attention mechanism (PAResAM), where some hyperparameters are tuned optimally by using an improved arithmetic optimization algorithm (IAOA). The performance is evaluated and measured with diverse metrics. Thus, the outcome of the model ensures that it exploits a higher detection accuracy value.

AB Algorithmic decision-making systems have the potential to amplify existing discriminatory patterns and negatively affect perceptions of justice in society. There is a need for a revision of mechanisms to address discrimination in light of the unique challenges presented by these systems, which are not easily auditable or explainable. Research efforts to bring fairness to ADM solutions should be viewed as a matter of justice and trust among actors should be ensured through technology design. Ideas that move us to explore the notions of justice within the field of political thinking, aiming to identify the elements that frame the social context of the discriminatory decisions produced by algorithmic decision-making solutions. Our explorations suggest that the efforts to bring fairness to ADMs should be seen as a matter of justice and that trust in these systems can be ensured through careful technology design.

AB Offline handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) is a significant area in mathematical expression recognition. However, offline HMER is often viewed as a much more complex problem than online HMER due to a lack of temporal information and variability in writing style. This paper proposes an encoder-decoder model that uses paired adversarial learning. Semantic-invariant features are extracted from handwritten mathematical expression images and their printed mathematical expression counterpart in the encoder. Learning semantic-invariant features combined with the DenseNet encoder and transformer decoder helped us to improve the expression rate from previous studies. Evaluated on the CROHME dataset, we have improved the latest CROHME 2019 test set results by 4% approx.

AB Solar Irradiance depicts the light energy produced by the Sun that hits the Earth. This energy is important for renewable energy generation and is intrinsically fluctuating. Forecasting solar irradiance is crucial for efficient solar energy generation and management. Work in the literature focused on the short-term prediction of solar irradiance, using meteorological data to forecast the irradiance for the next hours, days, or weeks. Facing climate change and the continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the use of fossil fuels, the reliance on renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, is expanding. Consequently, governments and practitioners are calling for efficient long-term energy generation plans, which could enable 100% renewable-based electricity systems to match energy demand. In this paper, we aim to perform the long-term prediction of daily solar irradiance, by leveraging the downscaled climate simulations of Global Circulation Models (GCMs). We propose a novel Bayesian deep learning framework, named DeepSI (denoting Deep Solar Irradiance), that employs bidirectional long short-term memory autoencoders, prefixed to a transformer, with an uncertainty quantification component based on the Monte Carlo dropout sampling technique. We use DeepSI to predict daily solar irradiance for three different locations within the United States. These locations include the Solar Star power station in California, Medford in New Jersey, and Farmers Branch in Texas. Experimental results showcase the suitability of DeepSI for predicting daily solar irradiance from the simulated climate data, its superiority over related machine learning methods, and its ability to reproduce the daily variability. We further use DeepSI with future climate simulations to produce long-term projections of daily solar irradiance, up to year 2099.

AB Due to the complexity of natural language, the current relation extraction methods can no longer meet people's requirements. Dependency trees have been proved to be able to capture the long-distance relation between the target entity pairs, this study mainly focuses on how to prune the dependency tree more effectively, and improve the model's performance by retaining the original dependency structure of the sentence and dependency relation weighting without man-made noise. We propose a new weighted-dependency with attention-based graph convolutional network (WAGCN), which changed the dependency matrix from a 0-1 matrix to a weighted matrix by weighting each dependency class to enable the dependency matrix to fully express the syntactic dependency information in the sentence. Moreover, we improve the connection structure of the attention mechanism, densely connected network and GCN to extract important information by applying the attention mechanism directly to the text, and compute it in parallel with the dependency matrix GCN module. We conducted experiments on three popular datasets, WAGCN is superior to baseline models, such as C-AGGCN and LST-AGCN, in most experiment metrics.

LA English
DT Article; Early Access

   image segmentation
AB Colonic polyps are highly correlated with colorectal cancer. Prevention of colorectal cancer is the detection and removal of polyps in the early stages of the disease. But the detection process relies on the physician's experience and is prone to missed diagnoses. The drawbacks motivate us to design an algorithm to automatically assist physicians in detection to reduce the rate of missed polyps. However, polyp segmentation encounters challenges due to the variable appearance and blurred borders with the surrounding mucosa. And it is difficult for existing CNN-based polyp segmentation algorithms to learn long-range dependencies. Therefore, we propose a region-enhanced attention transformer network (RT-Net) for polyp segmentation. Unlike existing CNN-based approaches, it employs a pyramid Transformer encoder to promote the learning ability and robustness of the network. In addition, we introduce three modules, including the residual multiscale (RMS) module, the region-enhanced attention (REA) module and the feature aggregation (FA) module. Specifically, the RMS module learns multiscale information from the features of the encoder. The REA module adopts the prediction maps of each decoder layer to guide the network in building target regions and boundary cues to compensate for the missing local fields of view in the encoder. The role of the FA module is to efficiently aggregate the features from REA with those from the decoding layer to achieve better segmentation performance. RT-Net is evaluated on five benchmark polyp datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RT-Net exhibits excellent performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB During human-machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annota-tions in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the im-plantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D recon-struction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably.

AB With the increasing availability of consumer depth sensors, 3D face recognition (FR) has attracted more and more attention. However, the data acquired by these sensors are often coarse and noisy, making them impractical to use directly. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Depth map denoising network (DMDNet) based on the Denoising Implicit Image Function (DIIF) to reduce noise and enhance the quality of facial depth images for low-quality 3D FR. After generating clean depth faces using DMDNet, we further design a powerful recognition network called Lightweight Depth and Normal Fusion network (LDNFNet), which incorporates a multi branch fusion block to learn unique and complementary features between different modalities such as depth and normal images. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four distinct low-quality databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods. Furthermore, when combining DMDNet and LDNFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the Lock3DFace database.

DE User cold-start problem; User relevance; Meta-learning; Heterogeneous
   information network; Representation learning
AB User cold-start recommendation is a critical problem due to the sparse user-item interactions of new users. To address this issue, an emerging popular direction employs the meta-learning paradigm, which can quickly adapt to new tasks with sparsely labeled data. Early meta-learning recommendation works use the same global prior to initialize the parameters for each user's preference learning task, which may be insufficient to discern users' complex behaviors and leads to poor generalization. As a result, recent works have proposed the concept of relevance-based meta-learning recommendation, which ensures that similar priors are locally shared by related users with similar preferences, and have yielded promising results. However, as an important factor influencing the performance of relevance based meta-learning recommendation, related user information is still not sufficiently explored and exploited in existing works. To that end, in this paper, we present a novel adaptive meta-learning model based on user relevance (AdaML) to further improve the user cold-start recommendations. Specifically, AdaML firstly proposes a related user recognition component, which recognizes related users with similar preferences by integrating the meta-path-based and the clustering-based strategies. The retrieved high-quality information of related users is then effectively utilized by a well-designed user relevance enhanced recommender, on one hand, to enhance user representations and tailor relevancespecific priors from the globally shared prior, on the other. Finally, extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate AdaML's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in the user cold-start scenario.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Modern artificial intelligence (AI) approaches mainly rely on neural network (NN) or deep NN methodologies. However, these approaches require large amounts of data to train, given, that the number of their trainable parameters has a polynomial relationship to their neuron counts. This property renders deep NNs challenging to apply in fields operating with small, albeit representative datasets such as healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture which trains spatial positions of neural soma and axon pairs, where weights are calculated by axon-soma distances of connected neurons. We refer to this method as distance-encoding biomorphic-informational (DEBI) neural network. This concept significantly minimizes the number of trainable parameters compared to conventional neural networks. We demonstrate that DEBI models can yield comparable predictive performance in tabular and imaging datasets, where they require a fraction of trainable parameters compared to conventional NNs, resulting in a highly scalable solution.

AB In recent years, many dynamic graph representation learning methods have emerged due to the ubiquity of dynamic graph networks, such as social networks, medical networks, citation networks and traffic networks. Many researchers only consider the unitary relational topological information in a dynamic graph. However, real dynamic networks contain a large amount of multi-relational topological information. For example, there are different interactive relations such as sending a message, adding a friend, making a phone call, and sending an email in a social network, and they have different effects on node representation and should be distinguished. In addition, the non-topological information of nodes plays an important role in the node representation. Although these two types of information have been shown to improve the performance of many dynamic graph tasks, existing dynamic graph representation learning models could not integrate them well. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MRDGNN, a Multi-Relational Dynamic Graph Neural Network model, which can capture the dynamic evolution under each relational topology in the graph through a temporal multi-relational topology updater, including the participation of multi-relational topological and non-topological information of nodes. These two kinds of information will be adaptively fused into the representation of nodes by a merger. MRDGNN is continuously updated with the evolution of dynamic graphs and is a real-time learnable representation learning framework. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of MRDGNN for link prediction and relation prediction on four real datasets.

DE Image restoration; Mobile ISP systems; Computational photography; Deep

AB In the photograph of mobile terminal, image degradation is a multivariate problem, where the spectral of the scene, the lens imperfections, the sensor noise, and the field of view together contribute to the results. Besides eliminating it at the hardware level, the post-processing system, which utilizes various prior information, is significant for correction. However, due to the content differences among priors, the pipeline that directly aligns these factors shows limited efficiency and unoptimized restoration. Here, we propose a prior quantization model to correct the degradation introduced in the image formation pipeline. To integrate the multivariate messages, we encode various priors into a latent space and quantify them by the learnable codebooks. After quantization, the prior codes are fused with the image restoration branch to realize targeted optical degradation correction. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive synthetic flow to acquire data pairs in a relative low computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method and validate its potential to accomplish targeted restoration for mass-produced mobile terminals. Furthermore, our model promises to analyze the influence of various priors and the degradation of devices, which is helpful for joint soft-hardware design.

AB Pedicle drilling is a complex and critical spinal surgery task. Detecting breach or penetration of the surgical tool to the cortical wall during pilot-hole drilling is essential to avoid damage to vital anatomical structures adjacent to the pedicle, such as the spinal cord, blood vessels, and nerves. Currently, the guidance of pedicle drilling is done using image-guided methods that are radiation intensive and limited to the preoperative information. This work proposes a new radiation-free breach detection algorithm leveraging a non-visual sensor setup in combination with deep learning approach. Multiple vibroacoustic sensors, such as a contact microphone, a free-field microphone, a tri-axial accelerometer, a uni-axial accelerometer, and an optical tracking system were integrated into the setup. Data were collected on four cadaveric human spines, ranging from L5 to T10. An experienced spine surgeon drilled the pedicles relying on optical navigation. A new automatic labeling method based on the tracking data was introduced. Labeled data was subsequently fed to the network in mel-spectrograms, classifying the data into breach and non-breach. Different sensor types, sensor positioning, and their combinations were evaluated. The best results in breach recall for individual sensors could be achieved using contact microphones attached to the dorsal skin (85.8%) and uni-axial accelerometers clamped to the spinous process of the drilled vertebra (81.0%). The best-performing data fusion model combined the latter two sensors with a breach recall of 98%. The proposed method shows the great potential of non-visual sensor fusion for avoiding screw misplacement and accidental bone breaches during pedicle drilling and could be extended to further surgical applications.

AB Efficient reasoning about the spatial and temporal structure of the environment is crucial for perception in autonomous driving, particularly in an end-to-end approach. Although different sensor modalities are employed to capture the complex nature of the environment, they each have their limitations. For example, frame-based RGB cameras are susceptible to variations in illumination conditions. However, these limitations at the sensor level can be addressed by complementing them with sensor fusion techniques, enabling the learning of efficient feature representations for end-to-end autonomous perception. In this study, we address the end-to-end perception problem by fusing a frame-based RGB camera with an event camera to improve the learned representation for predicting lateral control. To achieve this, we propose a convolutional encoder- decoder architecture called DRFuser. DRFuser encodes the features from both sensor modalities and leverages self-attention to fuse the frame-based RGB and event camera features in the encoder part. The decoder component unrolls the learned features to predict lateral control, specifically in the form of a steering angle. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on three datasets: our collected Dataset, Davis Driving dataset, and the EventScape dataset for simulation. The results demonstrate the generalization capability of our method on both real-world and simulated datasets. We observe qualitative and quantitative improvements in the performance of the proposed method for predicting lateral control by incorporating the event camera in fusion with the frame-based RGB camera. Notably, our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the Davis Driving Dataset, achieving a 5.6% improvement in the root mean square error (RMSE) score.

AB Our study contributes to the empirical literature in two ways: 1) We propose an innovative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to estimate the cost efficiency of Chinese banks; 2) We propose a Stochastic Structural Relationship Programming (SSRP) Model based on neural networks to evaluate the interrelationships between efficiency and other bank-specific variables. The findings show that Chinese commercial banks experienced a gradual increase in the level of efficiency from 2010 up to 2015, after which the efficiency level experienced slight volatility and, by the end of 2018, ended up with an efficiency score of 0.746 on a scale of 0 to 1. We find that for banks with lower levels of efficiency, improvement in the efficiency level has a favorable effect on profitability, and these banks will also focus their business on traditional banking activities. Banks with higher levels of efficiency need to find alternative, profitable banking businesses in order to sustain their higher level of efficiency.

AB Pest control is essential for crop planting as crops are highly susceptible to pest damage. In general, pest recognition is a fundamental element of pest control. Previous works have used computer vision to achieve automatic pest recognition. However, only a few of them have focused on the open-world pest recognition problem. That is, most methods cannot process new pest categories without expensive network retraining. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an open-world pest image classifier based on two observations: (1) convolutional features learned from previous pest classes are generally applicable to new pest categories, and (2) removing fully-connected neural layers allows a deep network to be exempted from model fine-tuning in case of a new class. First, an optimized lightweight ResNet8-based matching network is developed as the image feature extractor, which saves computational resources. To prevent model collapse, the proposed ResNet8-based matching network is trained with the normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss function instead of the triplet loss function. The trained ResNet8-based matching network is then used to compute similarities between support class prototypes and query image representations for the pest classification. Compared with the state -of-the-arts, the proposed method has achieved the highest 40-way 5-shot classification accuracy of 84.29 +/- 0.23% with 14.18 frames per second on the D0 dataset. It is significantly superior to the ResNet12-based baseline. These suggest that the proposed method is a technically feasible solution to the open-world pest recognition problem.

AB Supercomputing power is one of the fundamental pillars of the digital society, which depends on the accurate scheduling of parallel applications in High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers to minimize computing times. However, precedence-constraint task scheduling is a well-known NP-Hard optimization problem, and no optimal polynomial-time algorithm exists to solve it. Therefore, as accurate as possible to the optimal values, heuristic algorithms are of relevant interest. Our new scheduling proposal name is EFT-GVNS, which stands for Earliest Finish Time -General Variable Neighborhood Search. EFT-GVNS uses a Composite Local Search (CLS), making our proposal more efficient than traditional GVNS. EFT-GVNS accuracy against four high-performance algorithms from the state-of-the-art (EDA, EFT-ILS, GRASP-CPA, MPQGA) and one reference algorithm in the literature (HEFT) is studied. Experimental results over four real-world applications (Fpppp, LIGO, Robot, Sparse) and 14 synthetic instances from the literature show that EFT-GVNS outperforms in terms of the median achieved results, with a global improvement of 37.6%, 27.4%, 17.8%, 6.1%, 2.2% to HEFT, EDA, EFT-ILS, GRASP-CPA, and MPQGA, respectively. EFT-GVNS achieves all the 14 optimal values of the synthetic benchmark.

   bottleneck; Node classification; Node clustering
AB Graph contrastive learning aims to learn informative and discriminative node representations for downstream tasks by maximizing the mutual information between representations of different augmentation views of the same node. However, according to the multi-view information bottleneck principle, redundant information in learned representations can negatively impact the performance of downstream tasks. To avoid this issue, we propose Adversarial Cluster-Level and Global-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (ACG-GCL) for learning minimal sufficient node representations. ACG-GCL is optimized alternately under an adversarial learning framework with a min-max objective. At the min step, ACG-GCL eliminates redundant information in both the graph structure and feature content of nodes while producing a new graph that provides multi-view information. At the max step, ACG-GCL seeks to preserve shared task-relevant information in the learned representation by maximizing the mutual information of node-cluster level and node-global level representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the tasks of node classification and node clustering tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tangq123/ACG-GCL.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Aiming at the problems of single optimization strategy and poor comprehensive performance of MOFA, multi-objective firefly algorithm with adaptive region division is proposed in this paper. By leveraging the convergence index, our algorithm intelligently divides the dominant and non-dominant solution groups into three sub-regions, namely balance, exploration, and development areas, each with a distinct learning strategy that complements the strengths of fireflies. Specifically, fireflies in the balance area learn from global optimal particles with diversity to achieve a balanced exploration and development ability. Fireflies in the exploration area jointly learn from globally optimal particles with convergence and diversity, increasing the algorithm's likelihood of discovering Pareto optimal solutions. Lastly, fireflies in the development area rapidly converge under the guidance of the globally optimal particle of convergence, thus improving the algorithm's development ability. To further enhance the comprehensive optimization performance, we introduce a novel fusion index as an external archive update strategy that preserves solutions with superior convergence and diversity. Our experiments on 20 benchmark functions and a multi-objective optimization power flow example demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other multi-objective optimization algorithms, highlighting its superior optimization performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The corporate bankruptcy prediction literature has traditionally relied on data from public, audited companies. However, the vast majority of firms worldwide are privately-held and lack the same level of scrutiny over their financial statements. As a result, these businesses usually produce less accurate and transparent accounting reports. Our research problem is to address this gap: how stakeholders deal with these less reliable information? Using a novel dataset of 503 private firms that filed for reorganization in Brazil between 2007 and 2020, we found that financial ratios had a significantly lesser effect on explaining default and bankruptcy than what previous research suggested, due in part to the lower information content in the accounting statements within our database. Instead, lenders seem to focus on harder-to-conceal variables, such as collateralizable assets, as well as on institutional factors, like proxies of financial statement quality. There is also concerning evidence that specialized attorneys can "work the system" in favor of distressed companies regardless of their financial fundamentals. Additionally, we found that machine learning models outperformed traditional statistical ones in different sorts of metrics, corroborating the literature on the superior performance of non-linear approaches on datasets having synergistic causality among its features.

AB The nonlinear, time correlation, and non-Gaussian features in data present significant challenges for effective fault detection. While the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is renowned for its capacity to manage time correlation, it falls short in capturing non-Gaussian features in process data, which can likely lead to suboptimal monitoring results. To address this limitation, the Enhancement Gate Recurrent Unit (ENGRU) is developed to perfect the fault detection accuracy of the network. Specifically, The ENGRU effectively extracts high order statistics information by employing the overcompleted independent component analysis method, thereby augmenting its ability to capture non-Gaussian properties. The extracted features information are then entered into the ENGRU model further to uncover additional hidden features beyond what the GRU can achieve. The ENGRU network, which is built upon the extracted characteristic information, even farther enhances the accuracy of the fault detection. The merits of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing it with excellent fault detection algorithms on a benchmark platform.

ID PENETRATION
AB Despite the high efficiency of keyhole plasma arc welding (K-PAW), it still has several deficiencies, such as narrow welding parameter ranges, easily disturbed welding process and instability of welding quality, etc. It is a significant prerequisite to predict the keyhole/penetration status accurately for maintaining the welding process stability and improving the welding quality. Most researchers have focused on visual inspection techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN), establishing a mathematical model of the correlation between weld pool images and penetration status. While CNN could extract the features of single weld pool images, it is difficult to predict the evolution trend of the incoming moments. In this paper, a novel model based on CNN and LSTM (long-short term memory) was developed to extract both the spatial and temporal features of topside weld pool images, and consequently the complex keyhole behaviors were predicted and described. The comparative study is carried out on different models, i.e. the single CNN model, the single LSTM model, and the CNN-LSTM model that integrates both spatial features of single images and temporal features of sequence. The keyhole initialization and establishing period, as the typical and critical welding scenario in full-penetration welding, is investigate and compared, resulting in a predicted value that is close to reality. Furthermore, ahead prediction of keyhole status was adopted, maintaining over 80% accuracy even when predicting keyhole behaviors 2 s into the future. Consequently, the unified CNN-LSTM model effectively improves the prediction accuracy of keyhole/ penetration status, promising for intelligent K-PAW technology.

AB Pansharpening is a technique that combines a high-resolution panchromatic image (HRPAN) and a low-resolution multi-spectral image (LRMS) to generate a high-resolution multi-spectral image (HRMS). Traditional methods perform sharpening based on given image pairs, but their performance is limited due to the employment of scale-varying linear mapping assumptions. Existing deep-learning-based methods can establish arbitrary non-linear sharpening functions based on large-scale training data. However, supervised methods suffer from scale-variance generalization for training on the simulated reduced resolution data, while unsuper-vised methods arise distortion for the absence of reference and introduction of inaccurate spectral observation assumptions. Besides, the generic satellite-specific learning (i.e. training and testing on the homologous satellite data) causes low generalization when processing the heterologous satellite data. To this end, we combine the advantages of deep learning and variational optimization, to propose a universal pansharpening method that can be applied across different satellites with reducing the scale variance, termed as Zero-Sharpen. On the one hand, we build image-pair-specific neural networks to extend the spatial mapping and spectral observation assumptions to the nonlinear space. These assumptions are incorporated as deep spatial prior and deep spectral observation prior for regularization, assisting variational models to iteratively adapt to the full-resolution scale. On the other hand, the variational optimization mechanism also promotes the optimization of deep networks so as to achieve the preservation of spectral and spatial information in a zero-shot learning manner. In doing so, our method can be easily available across different satellites. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB Attribute reduction with an accelerator is an efficient strategy to handle large-scale information systems, but it is rarely suitable for information systems with fuzzy decision (ISFD). Meanwhile, both three-way approximations (TA) and fuzzy knowledge distance (FKD) are two types of attractive uncertainty measures in ISFD. Therefore, it prompts us to deliberate on how to interact the merits of TA with FKD to develop an attribute reduction with a three-way accelerator for ISFD. Driven by this concern, the TA of fuzzy decision is used as prior knowledge to interact with FKD, then a model named ITA-FKD is constructed to explore the monotonicity of uncertainty in multi-granularity spaces and measure the significance of every attribute. A three-way accelerator is implemented to eradicate redundant objects and attributes with the aid of the ITA-FKD model. Subsequently, a filter-wrapper approximate attribute reduction with the unique accelerator is successfully devised. Ultimately, some comprehensive experiments with high-dimensional datasets containing biomedicine field exemplified the higher efficiency of the explored algorithm.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID NETWORK
AB Few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention due to its applicability to real world scenarios in which each novel class contains only a few labelled data. Although existing methods have made great progress, a great challenge still remains: inaccurate decision boundaries are induced by the scarcity of labelled data. In this paper, a Prototype Expansion and Feature Calibration (PEFC) method is proposed, which fully exploits the information contained in query data to increase the amounts of class prototypes and calibrate these prototypes. To this end, a Prototype Expansion Module (PEM) is designed, which clusters query data into pseudo prototypes and expands the set of class prototypes with pseudo prototypes that have a high similarity to the class prototypes. Then, a Feature Calibration Module (FCM) is designed to calibrate these class prototypes, which is achieved by enabling bidirectional information flow between class prototypes and query features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed PEFC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all experimental settings.

AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes that have no labeled samples during the training phase, which leads to the domain shift problem. In reality, there exists a large number of compounded unlabeled samples. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate the data distribution of these compounded unlabeled samples and improve the performance of ZSL. This paper proposes a zero-shot learning boosting framework. Specifically, ZSL is transformed into a co-training problem between the data distribution estimation of the unlabeled samples and ZSL. The data distribution estimation is modeled as concept-constrained clustering. Furthermore, we design an alternative optimization strategy to realize mutual guidance between the two processes. Finally, systematic experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed concept-constrained clustering for alleviating the domain shift problem in ZSL and the universality of the proposed framework for boosting different base ZSL models.

DE LIDAR point clouds; Object tracking; Gaussian sampling; Candidate

AB LIDAR point clouds are less affected by the weather and possess more depth of field than 2D images. However, sparsity and disorder of point clouds bring challenges for 3D object tracking due to the difficulty in detecting and encoding. In addition, ineffective candidate proposals increase the phenomenon of the loss of target tracking or wrong target tracking. In this paper, we propose an Orientation-variant Siamese 3D object tracking network that utilizes a Detection based Sampling module to generate candidate proposals (OS-DS tracker). The Detection based Sampling module is used to cut the excessive and useless proposals. And the multivariate Gaussian sampling generates the candidate proposals when the objects are not detected. Concretely, we first pre-train PointRCNN Network to globally detect objects from LIDAR point clouds. Then the 3D detected objects are refined by Candidate Regions Sampling to generate candidate proposals. Meanwhile, to make the feature vectors more discriminative, we design an Orientation-variant Siamese Auto-encoder, i.e., tracking loss regress to the intersection over union (IOU) of the template box and the candidate region boxes. Our method is tested on the KITTI dataset and the SHIP Tracking dataset. Compared with the previous state-of-the-arts, the proposed method outperforms in vessel tracking with 5.2%/2.1% improvement in Success and Precision.

ID DEMAND; POLICIES
AB Revenue management (RM) is essential for a wide range of industries such as airlines, hotels, cruise lines, fashion, and seasonal retail. This paper focuses on the multi-perishable-product dynamic pricing (MPPDP) problem, a significant research field in RM, where a company sells multiple interactive and perishable products over a limited selling window without replenishment. Most studies in this field assume customer behavior, which is modeled by demand function, is known in advance. Even when considering uncertainty in customer behavior, most studies still assume the mathematical form or structural properties of the underlying demand function are known in advance. However, these assumptions are usually inconsistent with the actual market situation. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), a potent technique for handling sequential decision-making problems, has been increasingly applied to solve complex dynamic pricing problems without relying on any assumption about demand functions. However, the curse of dimensionality poses a challenge for currently used centralized RL algorithms when solving the MPPDP problem due to the exponential expansion of the joint price space with the number of products. To address this issue, our paper proposes a distributed dynamic pricing framework and innovatively models the MPPDP problem as a Fully Cooperative Markov Game solved by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Additionally, we use counterfactual baselines to design appropriate agent-specific reward signals that facilitate faster learning for the agents in our established multi-agent cooperative system. Finally, two MARL-based distributed dynamic pricing algorithms, Counterfactual Q-learning, and Counterfactual DQN, are proposed for the MPPDP problem. Through the case studies on four computer-simulated markets, we show that our algorithms can alleviate the curse of dimensionality faced by centralized RL algorithms, expedite the learning process, and demonstrate satisfactory performance without relying on any assumption about demand functions. In conclusion, our work provides an effective MARL-based distributed dynamic pricing framework and algorithms for companies to efficiently price their multiple perishable products in modern highly uncertain markets.

ID NETWORK
AB Deep hashing techniques have received considerable attention and are widely used in the field of crossmodal retrieval. The training mode of deep cross-modal hashing models has also gradually converged. However, the commonly used training mode ignores noisy labels from different modality original datasets and can only generate fixed-length hash codes, resulting in poor robustness and flexibility of the training generated hash models. Therefore, to effectively optimize the training mode, we propose a multilabel aware framework for bit-scalable deep cross-modal hashing (MAFH) with the following contributions. First, we introduce a label network module to indirectly used the hash representation of multilabels to more accurately supervise the model training process across all modalities. Second, we design a scalable coding strategy to freely manipulate the length of the hash code, which makes the trained model flexible to adapt to different scenarios. Third, we propose a layered multilabel similarity algorithm to preserve more complete feature information, which avoids the loss of discriminative feature information during model training. The training mode of MAFH can effectively enhance model robustness, flexibility and accuracy. We selected thirteen representative hash methods to compare with the proposed method, and experimental results on four public datasets show that the proposed method achieves good performance. https://github.com/x-28/MAFH.git.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The energy of a graph, defined as the absolute sum of the eigenvalues (EIGs) of its adjacency matrix, has been applied to numerous research fields, including decision-making techniques. It can be defined for a fuzzy graph when the graph has uncertain vertices and edges. A bipolar intuitionistic fuzzy graph (BIFG) is an extended version of fuzzy graph that helps to deal with uncertainty in an effective manner. Therefore, this study unites the above-said concepts to examine the energy concepts with additional information and utilizes them in the decision-making problem to explore their applicability. Initially, the notions, relations and bounds of the energy, Laplacian energy (LE) and signless Laplacian energy (SLE) are defined. Further, a novel energy-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique is designed by utilizing the energy of BIFG to obtain the objective weights for the decision experts. The selection problem of five COVID-19 vaccines with respect to eight important criteria is taken to elucidate the proposed decision-making technique, where Moderna has resulted as the finest vaccine among other vaccines. Moreover, a comparative is done with the correlation and distance measures to show the superiority of the proposed method. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is done to depict the reliability of the proposed technique.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) on a single language has increased greatly in the last few years thanks to the use of deep learning techniques. However, cross-lingual SER remains a challenge in real world applications due to two main factors: the first is the big gap among the source and the target domain distributions; the second factor is the major availability of unlabeled utterances in contrast to the labeled ones for the new language. Taking into account previous aspects, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) method for cross-lingual emotion recognition when only few labeled examples in the target domain (i.e. the new language) are available. Our method is based on a Transformer and it adapts to the new domain by exploiting a pseudo-labeling strategy on the unlabeled utterances. In particular, the use of a hard and soft pseudo-labels approach is investigated. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a speaker-independent setup on both the source and the new language and show its robustness across five languages belonging to different linguistic strains. The experimental findings indicate that the unweighted accuracy is increased by an average of 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

ID MAINTENANCE; UNCERTAINTY; SELECTION
AB Pavement evaluation using multiple performance indicators has been a critical challenge in the field due to limitations in relying on pavement engineers to simultaneously assess several performance attributes, which usually leads to subjectivity and variability. In this study, a data-driven multidimensional framework is proposed to compact this issue by utilizing multilayer network representation learning. The key to this framework is to capture not only the performance conditions per se, but also the nonlinear interactions among these attributes. This provides an in-depth higher-order property of pavements' service condition. Specifically, pavement performance attributes are modeled into multilayer network with each layer representing an aspect of pavement condition. Subsequently, this multilayer pavement condition network is mapped into low -dimensional space through the network representation learning for systematic evaluation. Finally, unsupervised cluster analysis derives groups of pavements which share similar overall condition for future decision-making process. The proposed method is validated with a case study in the Research Institute of Highway Ministry track (RIOHTrack) and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in categorizing pavement condition based on multi-attributes.

   agnostic summarization; TxLASM; Text shape-encoding
AB In Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, the majority of automatic text summarization approaches depend on a prior knowledge of the language and/or the domain of the text being summarized. Such approaches requires language dependent part-of-speech taggers, parsers, databases, pre-structured lexicons, etc. In this research, we propose a novel automatic text summarization model, Text Documents -Language Agnostic Summarization Model (TxLASM), which is able to perform extractive text summarization task in language/domain agnostic manner. TxLASM depends on specific characteristics of the major elements of the text being summarized rather than its domain, context, or language and thus rules out the need for language dependent pre-processing tools, taggers, parsers, lexicons or databases. Within TxLASM, we present a novel technique for encoding the shapes of major text elements (paragraphs, sentences, n-grams and words); moreover, we present language independent pre-processing algorithms to normalize words and perform relative stemming or lemmatization. Those algorithms and its Shape-Coding technique enable the TxLASM to extract intrinsic features of text elements and score them statistically, and subsequently extract a representative summary that is independent of the text language, domain and context. TxLASM was applied on an English and Portuguese benchmark datasets, and the results were compared to twelve state-of-the-art approaches presented in recent literature. In addition, the model was applied on French and Spanish news datasets, and the results were compared to those obtained by standard commercial summarization tools. TxLASM has outperformed all the SOTA approaches as well as the commercial tools in all four languages while maintaining its language and domain agnostic nature.

TI DeepMatcher: A deep transformer-based network for robust and accurate

DE Deep learning; Local feature matching; Efficient transformer
ID MOTION
AB Local feature matching constitutes the cornerstone of multiple computer vision applications (e.g., 3D recon-struction and long-term visual localization), and has been successfully resolved by detector-free methods. To further improve the matching performance, more recent research has focused on designing sophisticated architectures but endures additional computational overhead. In this study, with a different perspective from previous studies, we aim to develop a deep and compact matching network to improve performance while reducing computing cost. The key insight is that a local feature matcher with deep layers can capture more human-intuitive and simpler-to-match features. To this end, we propose DeepMatcher, a deep transformer -based network that tackles the inherent obstacles of not being able to build a deep local feature matcher with current methods. DeepMatcher consists of: (1) a local feature extractor (LFE), (2) a feature-transition module (FTM), (3) a slimming transformer (SlimFormer), (4) a coarse matches module (CMM), and (5) a fine matches module (FMM). The LFE is utilized to generate dense keypoints with enriched features from the images. We then introduce the FTM to ensure a smooth transition of feature scopes from LFE to the subsequent SlimFormer because of their different receptive fields. Subsequently, we develop SlimFormer dedicated to DeepMatcher, which leverages vector-based attention to model the relevance among all keypoints, enabling the network to construct a deep Transformer architecture with less computational cost. Relative position encoding is applied to each SlimFormer to explicitly disclose the relative distance information, thereby improving the representation of the keypoints. A layer-scale strategy is also employed in each SlimFormer to enable the network to adaptively assimilate message exchange, thus endowing it to simulate human behavior, in which humans can acquire different matching cues each time they scan an image pair. By interleaving the self-and cross-SlimFormers multiple times, DeepMatcher can easily establish pixel-wise dense matches at the coarse level using the CMM. Finally, we consider match refinement as a combination of classification and regression problems and design an FMM to predict confidence and offset concurrently, thus generating robust and accurate matches. Compared with our baseline LoFTR in indoor/outdoor pose estimation, DeepMatcher surpasses it by 3.32%/2.91% in AUC@5 degrees. Besides, DeepMatcher and DeepMatcher-L significantly reduce computational cost and only consume 77.89% and 92.46% GFLOPs of LoFTR. Large DeepMatcher considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including outdoor pose estimation (MegaDepth dataset), indoor pose estimation (ScanNet dataset), homography estimation (HPatches dataset), and image matching (HPatches dataset), demonstrating the superior matching capability of a deep local feature matcher.

TI Network pruning via resource reallocation

DE Network pruning; Resource reallocation; Searching cost
AB Channel pruning is broadly recognized as an effective approach to obtain a small compact model through eliminating unimportant channels from a large cumbersome network. Contemporary methods typically perform iterative pruning procedure from the original over-parameterized model, which is both tedious and expensive especially when the pruning is aggressive. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective channel pruning technique, termed network Pruning via rEsource rEalLocation (PEEL), to quickly produce a desired slim model with negligible cost. Specifically, PEEL first constructs a predefined backbone and then conducts resource reallocation on it to shift parameters from less informative layers to more important layers in one round, thus amplifying the positive effect of these informative layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PEEL , we perform extensive experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental results show that structures uncovered by PEEL exhibit competitive performance with state-of-the-art pruning algorithms under various pruning settings. Encouraging results are also observed when applying PEEL to compress the semantic segmentation model. Our code is available at https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-PEEL.

AB Most previous studies on the scheduling problem in remanufacturing systems have focused on single or two production stages and economic criteria such as makespan or tardiness. However, environmental criteria like energy consumption or carbon emissions, as well as the lot-streaming production mode, have not been adequately addressed. This paper presents a novel approach to the energy-efficient remanufacturing system scheduling problem with lot-streaming production mode (ERSSP-LS) for the first time, which integrates disassembly, reprocessing, and reassembly three pivotal production stages. Firstly, a multi-objective mathematical model aimed at simultaneously minimizing the total energy consumption (TEC) and makespan (Cmax) is established and presented. To further reduce the TEC, the well-accepted energy-saving measure, known as the turn off and on strategy, is also integrated. Subsequently, a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm called HMOFFO, which combines the fruit fly optimization algorithm and simulated annealing mechanism is developed to seek the promising Pareto solution set. Finally, several experiments on a real-life case and a group of ten random test instances are carried out and the computational results affirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed HMOFFO in solving the ERSSP-LS.

TI PEPNet: A barotropic primitive equations-based network for wind speed

AB In wind speed prediction technologies, deep learning-based methods have achieved promising advantages. However, most existing methods focus on learning implicit knowledge in a data-driven manner but neglect some explicit knowledge from the physical theory of meteorological dynamics, failing to make stable and long-term predictions. In this paper, we explore introducing explicit physical knowledge into neural networks and propose Physical Equations Predictive Network (PEPNet) for multi-step wind speed predictions. In PEPNet, a new neural block called the Augmented Neural Barotropic Equations (ANBE) block is designed as its key component, which aims to capture the wind dynamics by combining barotropic primitive equations and deep neural networks. Specifically, the ANBE block adopts a two-branch structure to model wind dynamics, where one branch is physic-based and the other is data-driven-based. The physic-based branch constructs temporal partial derivatives of meteorological elements (including u-component wind, v-component wind, and geopotential height) in a new Neural Barotropic Equations Unit (NBEU). The NBEU is developed based on the barotropic primitive equations mode in numerical weather prediction (NWP). Besides, considering that the barotropic primitive mode is a crude assumption of atmospheric motion, another data-driven-based branch is developed in the ANBE block, which aims at capturing meteorological dynamics beyond barotropic primitive equations. Finally, the PEPNet follows a time-variant structure to enhance the model's capability to capture wind dynamics over time. To evaluate the predictive performance of PEPNet, we have conducted several experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and achieve optimal performance.

AB Multimodal data provide complementary information on the same context, leading to performance improve-ment in video action recognition. However, in reality, not all modalities are available at test time. To this end, we propose Cross-Modal Alignment and Translation (CMAT) framework for action recognition that is robust to missing modalities. Specifically, our framework first aligns representations of multiple modalities from the same video sample through contrastive learning, effectively alleviating the bias with respect to the type of missing modality. Then, CMAT learns to translate representations of one modality into that of another modality. This allows the representations of the missing modalities to be generated from the remaining modalities during the testing. Accordingly, CMAT fully utilizes multimodal information obtained through abundant interactions across modalities. The proposed CMAT achieves state-of-the-art performances in both complete and missing modality settings on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets. Moreover, extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our design.

AB Fifth-generation (5G) technology provides new possibilities for a variety of applications, but it also comes with challenges influenced by distinct aspects, such as the size of organizations that use such technology. Therefore, it is important to understand which architecture of 5G-radio access networks (RANs) is best for a given purpose; this requires an evaluation platform for assessment. This paper tackles this problem by presenting a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) solution based on a new integrated fuzzy set. The proposed integrated approach, which is based on a Type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy environment, is developed to address the application challenges of 5G-RANs architecture evaluation, as also to face the MCDM theoretical challenge represented by ambiguities and inconsistencies among decision makers within the decision making context of the presented case study. Many MCDM techniques for weighting and selection were presented from the literature, yet many of them still suffer from inconsistencies and uncertainty. Therefore, the chosen methods in this research are unique in a way that previous issues are addressed, making them suitable for integration with Type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy environment, and therefore creating a more robust decision platform for the presented challenge in this research, as a theoretical contribution. First, a new "Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency" (T2NN-FWZIC) technique is formulated for weighting the evaluation criteria of RAN architectures. Second, another new method, namely, "Type2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score Method" (T2NN-FDOSM), was formulated to select the optimal RAN architecture using the obtained weights. The weighting results by T2NN-FWZIC for the (n = 25) evaluation criteria revealed that (C21 latency and C22 reliability) as the most important criteria, with 0.06 value for each as opposed to (C15 Data Processing) as the lowest weighted criteria with 0.0186 value. As for T2NN-FDOSM, a total of four 5G-RAN architectures were evaluated, including "virtualized cloud RAN" coming as the optimal one, followed by "fog RAN," "cloud RAN," and finally "heterogeneous cloud RAN." The results were confirmed by carrying out a sensitivity analysis. The outcome of this study can be used to assist future 5G-RAN developments according to business needs and to establish an assessment platform for 5G technology in different domains and applications.

DE Short-term traffic flow prediction; Spatio-temporal multidimensional;
   Tensor decomposition; Grey model
AB Short-term traffic flow prediction is the key to traffic guidance and control and can directly affect the performance of intelligent transportation systems. Traffic flow data has the characteristics of volatility, chaos, and randomness, which affect the accuracy of the prediction model. Based on the multi-dimensional spatio-temporal data characteristics of traffic flow data, this paper combines the tensor higher-order singular value decomposition theory and the modeling mechanism of the classical grey model GM(1,1) model and establishes the grey GM(1,1) model with tensor higher-order singular values. The tensor higher-order singular value decomposition reflects the periodic, multi-modal, and holistic nature of traffic flow data, which can mitigate the volatility and randomness of traffic flow data and improve the accuracy of the model. Then, the new model is applied to highway short-time traffic flow prediction, analyzing the spatio-temporal nature of traffic flow data, giving the detailed steps of model modeling, and analyzing the correlation between the original traffic flow data and tensor approximation data using grey correlation degrees. There are three cases to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. Case 1 shows that the results of MAPE from nine modeling objects are stable at about 5%, which indicates that the new model has some stability; Case 2 shows that the new model is more adaptable to short-time traffic flow prediction based on the results of three different modeling and prediction objects; Case 3 uses the new model to compare it with two traditional grey forecasting models and two optimization models, and the results indicate that the new model has a total MAPE value of 5.172%, which is better than the other four grey forecasting models. Finally, the new model is applied to short-time traffic flow prediction, and its prediction results are consistent with the trend of the original traffic flow data, indicating that it can reveal the real-time characteristics of the traffic system to a certain extent and provide a reliable theoretical basis for traffic planning, control, and optimization.

TI ROUGE-SEM: Better evaluation of summarization using ROUGE combined with

DE Automatic summarization evaluation; Semantic similarity; Lexical
   similarity; Contrastive learning; Back-translation
AB With the development of pre-trained language models and large-scale datasets, automatic text summarization has attracted much attention from the community of natural language processing, but the progress of automatic summarization evaluation has stagnated. Although there have been efforts to improve automatic summarization evaluation, ROUGE has remained one of the most popular metrics for nearly 20 years due to its competitive evaluation performance. However, ROUGE is not perfect, there are studies have shown that it is suffering from inaccurate evaluation of abstractive summarization and limited diversity of generated summaries, both caused by lexical bias. To avoid the bias of lexical similarity, more and more meaningful embedding-based metrics have been proposed to evaluate summaries by measuring semantic similarity. Due to the challenge of accurately measuring semantic similarity, none of them can fully replace ROUGE as the default automatic evaluation toolkit for text summarization. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a compromise evaluation framework (ROUGE-SEM) for improving ROUGE with semantic information, which compensates for the lack of semantic awareness through a semantic similarity module. According to the differences in semantic similarity and lexical similarity, summaries are classified into four categories for the first time, including good-summary, pearl-summary, glass-summary, and bad-summary. In particular, the back-translation technique is adopted to rewrite pearl-summary and glass-summary that are inaccurately evaluated by ROUGE to alleviate lexical bias. Through this pipeline framework, summaries are first classified by candidate summary classifier, then rewritten by categorized summary rewriter, and finally scored by rewritten summary scorer, which are efficiently evaluated in a manner consistent with human behavior. When measured using Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall rank coefficients, our proposal achieves comparable or higher correlations with human judgments than several state-of-the-art automatic summarization evaluation metrics in dimensions of coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance. This also suggests that improving ROUGE with semantics is a promising direction for automatic summarization evaluation

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Given the often enormous effort required to train GANs, both computationally as well as in dataset collection, the re-use of pretrained GANs largely increases the potential impact of generative models. Therefore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method for generative models based on mining the knowledge that is most beneficial to a specific target domain, either from a single or multiple pretrained GANs. This is done using a miner network that identifies which part of the generative distribution of each pretrained GAN outputs samples closest to the target domain. Mining effectively steers GAN sampling towards suitable regions of the latent space, which facilitates the posterior finetuning and avoids pathologies of other methods, such as mode collapse and lack of flexibility. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on small target domains, we introduce sparse subnetwork selection, that restricts the set of trainable neurons to those that are relevant for the target dataset. We perform comprehensive experiments on several challenging datasets using various GAN architectures (BigGAN, Progressive GAN, and StyleGAN) and show that the proposed method, called MineGAN, effectively transfers knowledge to domains with few target images, outperforming existing methods. In addition, MineGAN can successfully transfer knowledge from multiple pretrained GANs. MineGAN.

TI Assessing the Potential of Data Augmentation in EEG Functional

AB Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are acquired non-invasively from electrodes placed on the scalp. Experts in the field can use EEG signals to distinguish between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal control (NC) subjects using classification models. However, the training of deep learning or machine learning models requires a large number of trials. Datasets related to Alzheimer's disease are typically small in size due to the lack of AD patient samples. The lack of data samples required for the training process limits the use of deep learning techniques for further development in clinical settings. We propose to increase the number of trials in the training set by means of a decomposition-recombination system consisting of three steps. Firstly, the original signals from the training set are decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions via multivariate empirical mode decomposition. Next, these intrinsic mode functions are randomly recombined across trials. Finally, the recombined intrinsic mode functions are added together as artificial trials, which are used for training the models. We evaluated the decomposition-recombination system on a small dataset using each subject's functional connectivity matrices as inputs. Three different neural networks, including ResNet, BrainNet CNN, and EEGNet, were used. Overall, the system helped improve ResNet training in both the mild AD dataset, with an increase of 5.24%, and in the mild cognitive impairment dataset, with an increase of 4.50%. The evaluation of the proposed data augmentation system shows that the performance of neural networks can be improved by enhancing the training set with data augmentation. This work shows the need for data augmentation on the training of neural networks in the case of small-size AD datasets.

DE Ambiguous set; Ambiguous logic; Four-valued logic; Ambiguous inference

AB Ambiguous set has recently been introduced as a new branch of mathematics and computer science dealing with the nature of ambiguity of uncertain events. There is much scope for the development of new theories based on the principles of the ambiguous set. In this direction, an idea of ambiguous logic is proposed, which can be regarded as a family of four-valued logic. In this study, the limitations of existing theories such as fuzzy logic, intuitionistic fuzzy logic, and neutrosophic logic that are used to deal with uncertainty are first discussed. Then an introduction to the ambiguous set and ambiguous logic is given. In ambiguous logic, there are four membership degrees for each proposition, which can be characterized as true, false, true-ambiguous, and false-ambiguous. We then analyze the membership degrees of propositions using various connectives, including negation, conjunction, and disjunction. In this study, we discuss various laws that support the different algebraic operations for comparing propositions in terms of membership degrees. An approach is presented to define a rule using a proposition consisting of membership degrees, called an ambiguous rule. The modus ponens rule of inference is defined by combining various ambiguous rules, and is called ambiguous inference. Finally, to demonstrate the real-time application of ambiguous logic, an ambiguous inference system is designed that can be used in machine control systems.

DE Salient object detection; Low-light images; Position-aware;

AB Due to insufficient photons and undesirable noise, salient objects in low-light scenes are ambiguous, thus limiting the performance of existing salient object detection (SOD) works. To solve this problem, inspired by the hunting mechanism of predators in biology, we propose a position-aware and identification-aware network (PaIaNet) for SOD. First, we design a position-aware decoder (PaD) for obtaining position encodes by locating the edges and main bodies of salient objects. Second, we construct an identification-aware decoder (IaD) to reason accurate saliency maps by aggregating adjacent features under the guidance of position encodes. Moreover, we propose a reverse loss to suppress background interference effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably from comparisons of qualitative and quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art methods in SOD of low-light images, and even achieves competitive performance when extended to normal-light scenes. Code will be available at https://github.com/yuehuihui000/PaIaNet.

DE Second-order cone programming; Support vector machine; Linear
   programming SVM
AB A new second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation inspired by the soft-margin linear programming support vector machine (LP-SVM) formulation and cost-sensitive framework is proposed. Our proposed method maximizes the slack variables related to each class by appropriately relaxing the bounds on the VC dimension using the l(infinity)-norm, and penalizes them using the corresponding regularization parametrization to control the trade-off between margin and slack variables. The proposed method has two main advantages: firstly, a flexible classifier is constructed that extends the advantages of the soft-margin LP-SVM problem to the second-order cone; secondly, due to the elimination of a conic restriction, only two SOCP problems containing second-order cone constraints need to be solved. Thus similar results to the SOCP-SVM problem are obtained with less calculational effort. Numerical experiments show that our method achieves the better classification performance than the conventional SOCP-SVM formulations and standard linear SVM formulations.

AB The influence maximization problem is one of the most fundamental topics in social networks. However, most existing studies have focused on non-attributed networks, neglecting the consideration of users' properties during information propagation. Additionally, specific scenarios may involve external queries that target a particular subset of users, which has not been adequately addressed in prior research. To address these limitations, this study first formulates the customized influence maximization (CIM) problem in the context of attributed social networks. The node score and influence probability are derived by fully considering the user's attributes and the external queries. Then, we develop two algorithms to identify a group of most influential nodes in CIM. The first is a heuristic algorithm based on discounted degree, which is able to find relatively high-quality solutions in a short time. The second is a meta-heuristic algorithm, which makes several adjustments to the original ant colony algorithm to make it efficient to the CIM problem. Specifically, multiple CIM-related heuristics are derived, and a heuristic adaptation strategy is designed to automatically assign the heuristic information to ants according to the search environments and stages. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

ID AGGREGATION OPERATORS
AB In multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM), the attributes can be placed into independent groups based on their properties through partitioning. First, the partitioned dual Hamy mean (PDHM) operator is introduced, along with its essential properties. This operator integrates these separate groups while preserving the relationships between the attributes within each group. Furthermore, the partitioned Hamy mean (PHM) and the PDHM operators are also constructed in the generalized orthopair fuzzy environment, namely the q-rung orthopair fuzzy PHM (q-ROFPHM), the q-rung orthopair fuzzy PDHM (q-ROFPDHM), and their weighted forms. Their essential properties are verified to ensure the validity of the proposed aggregation operators (AOs). Subsequently, a new MAGDM approach is developed, employing the proposed AOs. The MAGDM problem of selecting the best person is examined. Moreover, the research includes a sensitivity analysis in three directions and a comparative analysis of the proposed MAGDM approach with five different approaches. The findings indicate that applying attribute partitioning in the proposed approach mitigates the adverse impact of irrelevant attributes, leading to more feasible and reliable outcomes. Additionally, a practical case study focuses on selecting a suitable industry for investment among the five available options. This case study demonstrates the approach's effectiveness by considering five distinct qualities and results that make the Internet industry the best place to invest. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with four similar papers is also performed, indicating that the developed method's results are more reliable and consistent.

AB This paper presents the design and development of PepperOSC, an interface that connects Pepper and NAO robots with sound production tools to enable the development of interactive sonification in human-robot interaction (HRI). The interface uses Open Sound Control (OSC) messages to stream kinematic data from robots to various sound design and music production tools. The goals of PepperOSC are twofold: (i) to provide a tool for HRI researchers in developing multimodal user interfaces through sonification, and (ii) to lower the barrier for sound designers to contribute to HRI. To demonstrate the potential use of PepperOSC, this paper also presents two applications we have conducted: (i) a course project by two master's students who created a robot sound model in Pure Data, and (ii) a museum installation of Pepper robot, employing sound models developed by a sound designer and a composer/researcher in music technology using MaxMSP and SuperCollider respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the potential use cases of PepperOSC in social robotics and artistic contexts. These applications demonstrate the versatility of PepperOSC and its ability to explore diverse aesthetic strategies for robot movement sonification, offering a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness and appeal of human-robot interactions.

AB Compressive sensing provides a promising sampling paradigm for video acquisition for resource-limited sensor applications. However, the reconstruction of original video signals from sub-sampled measurements is still a great challenge. To exploit the temporal redundancies within videos during the recovery, previous works tend to perform alignment on initial reconstructions, which are too coarse to provide accurate motion estimations. To solve this problem, the authors propose a novel reconstruction network, named TSRN, for compressive video sensing. Specifically, the authors utilise a number of stacked temporal shift reconstruction blocks (TSRBs) to enhance the initial reconstruction progressively. Each TSRB could learn the temporal structures by exchanging information with last and next time step, and no additional computations is imposed on the network compared to regular 2D convolutions due to the high efficiency of temporal shift operations. After the enhancement, a bidirectional alignment module to build accurate temporal dependencies directly with the help of optical flows is employed. Different from previous methods that only extract supplementary information from the key frames, the proposed alignment module can receive temporal information from the whole video sequence via bidirectional propagations, thus yielding better performance. Experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a granular sentiment classification task that involves identifying sentiment polarities toward aspects in a sentence. Performing ABSA on online e-commerce reviews is essential for understanding customers' opinions about specific aspects of a product or service, which can help businesses make informed decisions to improve overall customer satisfaction. Although previous research on ABSA has demonstrated considerable achievements, ABSA remains challenging in Chinese. First, most previous approaches ignored the extraction of aspect multiword in Chinese ABSA tasks, leading to the omission of aspect words. Moreover, words with a specific part-of-speech (POS) in Chinese text may contain sentiment information. To effectively capture the information of sentiment words, POS information can be more extensively applied in the ABSA model. Herein, we propose a novel model named POS-ATAEPE-BiLSTM for ABSA in Chinese. The proposed model considers words and the corresponding POS information for training word vectors. In addition, the embedding layer contains text embedding, aspect embedding, and POS embedding. This study provides several key contributions. First, we propose a multiple-aspect-word extraction algorithm based on POS tagging and consider single aspect words and aspect multiwords for pre-training, reducing the omission of aspect words. Second, we introduce a novel framework for ABSA, which is based on POS-driven word embedding-training and contains POS information in the embedding layer to improve the performance of the ABSA model. We use three pre-training corpora (i.e., Chinese Wikipedia, online reviews, and news articles) for pre-training and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model in Chinese ABSA tasks.

ID MODEL
AB Groundwater resource analysis is an important technological means of avoiding disease and controlling water pollution. In this field of study, water quality assessments are conducted using sequential parametric values collected in real time. For evaluation reasons, several state-of-the-art water quality evolution mechanism typically employs a single time-invariant model to determine the quality of Water. As a result, it is challenging to illustrate the importance of randomness and contingency in the process of water quality assessment, leading to variations and errors in the procedure of quality assessment. In consideration of these limitations, this study proposes a Digital Twin inspired Hybrid System (DTHS) for water quality assessment in real time. In addition, the degree of water quality is offered as an indication for quantitatively assessing the health risk status. Observational data from a monitoring station in Chaheru, a locality in the Phagwara district of the Indian state of Punjab, are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of water quality determination, computational cost, and stability. The framework has achieved higher prediction accuracy (94.14%), sensitivity (93.74%), specificity (91.47%), and f-measure (92.37%), indicating its ability to accurately determine water quality. Additionally, the framework offers reduced computational delay and improved reliability and stability, making it a trustworthy solution for timely predictions with respect to water quality.

AB This research study proposes a novel mutation scheme mainly based on the manipulation equations of Tangent Search Optimization and mutualism phase of Symbiotic Organism Search algorithms to be implemented on the Equilibrium Optimization algorithm to enhance the solution diversity among the population individuals. Beneficial coordination between these governing search mechanisms enables maintaining diversity in the population. It eliminates the stagnation towards the local sub-optimal solutions over the search domain, significantly alleviating the inherent drawbacks of Equilibrium Optimizer. To assess the efficiency of the proposed diversity-enhanced Equilibrium Optimization algorithm (DEQUIL) on unconstrained problems, thirty-four multidimensional optimization test instances comprised of unimodal and multimodal benchmark problems have been solved, and respective performances are verified against those obtained from well-reputed new emerged metaheuristic algorithms. A comprehensive comparison based on the decisive metrics, including statistical analysis, performance index analysis, scalability tests, diversity analysis, and convergence rates demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid search methodology. Later, fourteen real-world constrained engineering problems with varying complexities were solved by the proposed DEQUIL method. The prediction performance of DEQUIL is compared with a wide range of available literature optimizers to scrutinize the improvements in problem-solving capabilities and seen that it can successfully cope with the complex constrained design problems outperforming the majority of the compared algorithm in most design cases.

AB Underwater images suffer from color distortion, low clarity and halos problems due to light absorption, particle scattering and non-uniform illumination. To address these degradation issues, a multi-cues underwater image restoration algorithm combined with light field technology is proposed. First, based on Epipolar Plane Image, the light field cue transmittance containing depth information is calculated. Then, according to the turbidity of the underwater image, the light field cue transmittance and the polarization cue transmittance are fused to obtain the multi-cues transmittance, which can effectively reduce the effect of particle scattering and color bias. Finally, the background light is estimated through the all-focus operation, which can effectively overcome the distortion of an underwater single image and simultaneously reduce the halo phenomenon. Experimental results show that the method achieves the best results evaluated by UCIQE, UIQM, PSNR, and SSIM, and the restored color under the method is closer to the actual image than other underwater restoration methods.

AB Singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular datasets has proved to be a useful multivariate data decomposition approach because of its ability to decompose both square and rectangular matrices. A variant of SVD approach utilizes the median as a robust location estimate other than the mean estimate used in the ordinary SVD. Since insufficient dataset and in addition, inefficiency of the median estimate seems to be a major setback of the existing robust SVD systems, this study envisaged an integrated algorithm that incorporated the Bootstrapped SVD and the sample myriad estimate in cropping a new SVD system, the Robust Bootstrapped SVD (RobBootSVD). The new RobBootSVD was appraised alongside the existing ones using the Principal Component Analysis biplot quality measures and the new RobBootSVD T2 measure. Applications on tobacco process datasets with both short and long runs and simulated datasets with various percentages of outliers showcase the viability of the new approach.

AB Offering Product-Service Systems (PSS) becomes an established strategy for companies to increase the provided customer value and ensure their competitiveness. Designing PSS business models, however, remains a major challenge. One reason for this is the fact that PSS business models are characterized by a long-term nature. Decisions made in the development phase must take into account possible scenarios in the operational phase. Risks must already be anticipated in this phase and mitigated with appropriate measures. Another reason for the design phase being a major challenge is the size of the solution space for a possible business model. Developers are faced with a multitude of possible business models and have the challenge of selecting the best one. In this article, a simheuristic optimization approach is developed to test and evaluate PSS business models in the design phase in order to select the best business model configuration beforehand. For optimization, a proprietary evolutionary algorithm is developed and tested. The results validate the suitability of the approach for the design phase and the quality of the algorithm for achieving good results. This could even be transferred to already established PSS.

AB Recently, the population density in cities has increased at a higher pace, so waste generation is on the rise in most societies due to population growth. Given this concern, it would be highly important to manage waste generation. Intelligent city planning is necessary to improve the quality of city life and make cities more livable. This paper presents an intelligent waste management system (IWMS) in smart cities based on Internet of Things components like sensors, detectors, and actuators. IWMS contains three main phases. The first phase of the system is to adapt the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy approach as an optimization process to better balance the energy consumption of smart waste bins (SBs), thus leading to extending the life of the smart waste network. The second phase is handling the missing values which are retrieved from SBs using an improved version of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm based on artificial hummingbird optimization (AHA), while the third phase presents an optimal energy-efficient route process for the routing of waste trucks that improves fuel efficiency and reduces the time to get an appropriate SB. According to the experimental results, the proposed system has achieved energy savings of 34% for the smart waste bin network. Moreover, compared to other systems, it has a lower mean error rate when generating missing values, and the results related to convergence and running time validate its superiority compared with other metaheuristic algorithms.

AB To study the evolution of specific cultures and times different kinds of pictures could be adopted. Family album photos may reveal socio-historical insights regarding those specific cultures and times. Along this path, this work addresses the problem of automatically dating an image by resorting to the analysis of an analog family album photo dataset. In particular, the IMAGO collection, which contains Italian photos shot in the 20th century, was considered. Thanks to the IMAGO dataset, it was possible to apply different deep learning-based architectures to date images belonging to photo albums without needing any other sources of information. In addition, we carried out cross-dataset experiments, which also involved models trained on American datasets, observing temporal shifts which may be due to known intercultural influences. We further explore such a possibility by qualitatively analyzing the cross-dataset interpretation of the trained deep-learning models with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm. In conclusion, deep learning models revealed their potential in terms of possible applications to intercultural research, from different points of view.

AB Music expresses thoughts and emotions in artistic form and is made up of different components including harmony, rhythm, and melody. Several musical elements are tied together during the songwriting process in order to generate melodies that are harmonic. A music melody is the essential element of any music to generate strong feelings from listeners and capture their interest. In the process of music appreciation, melody controls the emotional changes of music. It is an efficiently perceived part and the tone of a song. In recent years, Sichuan unvoiced music has developed rapidly and attracted much attention. This paper selects Sichuan unvoiced music as the main research theme and constructs a melody generation algorithm by utilizing the state-of-the-art techniques of deep learning (DL) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) and genetic algorithm (GA). Firstly, this paper briefly describes the concept of DL algorithms, the deep generation model, and sequence to sequence model, as they constitute the technological foundation for this research. Secondly, this paper proposes a melody generation algorithm that utilizes RNN-LSTM for melody generation and GA for melody optimization. More specifically, the melody is generated by preprocessing data, creating, and training the RNN-LSTM model. A GA was used to determine the melodic fitness function for eight songs as the fitness function directly affects the selected termination condition. The fitness function can be thought of as either a person or an evolutionary rule. Finally, the average score of these songs, before and after evolution, is calculated, which demonstrates that the analysis and rotation creation methods are more precise and that the song's average melody score is higher. The method proposed in this study has been thoroughly compared to the existing approaches proposed in earlier studies, and it was found that the approach we propose is more effective in terms of accuracy and the average melody score.

AB In recent years, there has been a surge in research addressing the question which properties predictive algorithms ought to satisfy in order to be considered fair. Three of the most widely discussed criteria of fairness are the criteria called equalized odds, predictive parity, and counterfactual fairness. In this paper, I will present a new impossibility result involving these three criteria of algorithmic fairness. In particular, I will argue that there are realistic circumstances under which any predictive algorithm that satisfies counterfactual fairness will violate both other fairness criteria, that is, equalized odds and predictive parity. As will be shown, this impossibility result forces us to give up one of four intuitively plausible assumptions about algorithmic fairness. I will explain and motivate each of the four assumptions and discuss which of them can plausibly be given up in order to circumvent the impossibility.

AB We tackle the insufficient context pattern limitation of existing Word-Word Attention caused by its spatial-shared property. To this end, we propose the Word-Context Attention method that utilizes item-wise filters to perform both temporal and spatial combinations. Specifically, the proposed method first compresses the global scale left and right context words into fixed-length vectors respectively. Then, a group of specific filters are learned to select features from the word and its context vectors. Last, a non-linear transformation is adopted to merge and activate the selected features. Since each word has its exclusive context filters and non-linear semantic transformations, the proposed method has the property of being spatial-specific, and thus can generate flexible context patterns. Experimental comparisons demonstrate the feasibility of our model and its attractive computational performance.

AB Many highways are acquiring smart transportation systems to improve traffic efficiency, safety and management. Intelligent transportation systems can monitor traffic congestion by providing estimated time of arrival or suggesting a diversion route. However, due to the chaotic complexity of the highway traffic road network and the short-term mobility of the population, traffic flow prediction is affected by many complex factors, and the development of an effective traffic flow forecasting system is very challenging. This paper establishes a novel framework to enhance the prediction of highway traffic flow based on the integration of Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Gaussian Mixture Model (CEEMD-GMM). Firstly, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose and reduce the noise of traffic flow data. The empirical modal components are combined by calculating the sample entropy (SE), which makes the time series stable and reduces the time cost of forecasting. Secondly, the histogram of oriented gradient (HoG) is computed to extract the distinct features of various traffic flows and enhance the traffic flow prediction. Furthermore, the highway traffic data is classified using Gaussian mixture model to realize the feature extraction of different types of highway traffics. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and average correlation. The model is extensively verified using traffic flow data under individual weather conditions and different traffic flow datasets. Compared with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and Adaboost algorithms, the proposed model shows 2.90% MAE, 6.07% RMSE, 0.38% MAPE and average correlation coefficient of 0.74 for traffic flow detection. It is concluded that the model can predict the highways traffic flow with high accuracy as compared to other contemporary models.

AB This paper proposes field programmable gate array (FPGA) realization of fuzzy PI controller for typical industrial process called stirred tank heater system. Due to the complex nature of fuzzy controller families, its implementation on digital signal processors (DSPs) result computational time delay which, in other words, makes the processing speed slower. To address the limitations of DSP implementation, an alternative digital hardware programmable device called FPGAs are being largely used for digital implementation of algorithms with higher computational speed and accuracy. The proposed work is inspired by this quality of FPGAs and aims to take advantage of reliable performance of fuzzy PI controllers with its complexity and having no considerable impact on processing speed. Here, fast and novel design approach for rapid prototyping of fuzzy PI controller for stirred tank heater is presented thoroughly. Xilinx system generator SIMULINK add on from VIVADO is used to generate very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL) directly from MATLAB. The developed controller for stirred tank system is verified in fixed point arithmetic using Xilinx Simulink blocks. The VHDL code is then generated, synthesized, implemented, and made ready for physical implementation on Kintex-7 evaluation board.

ID ECG; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Arrhythmias can pose a significant threat to cardiac health, potentially leading to serious consequences such as stroke, heart failure, cardiac arrest, shock, and sudden death. In computer-aided electrocardio-gram interpretation systems, the inclusion of certain classes of arrhythmias, which we term "aggressive"or "bullying,"can lead to the underdiagnosis of other "vulnerable"classes. To address this issue, a method for arrhythmia diagnosis is proposed in this study. This method combines morphological -char-acteristic-based waveform clustering with Bayesian theory, drawing inspiration from the diagnostic reasoning of experienced cardiologists. The proposed method achieved optimal performance in macro-recall and macro-precision through hyperparameter optimization, including spliced heartbeats and clusters. In addition, with increasing bullying by aggressive arrhythmias, our model obtained the highest average recall and the lowest average drop in recall on the nine vulnerable arrhythmias. Further-more, the maximum cluster characteristics were found to be consistent with established arrhythmia diag-nostic criteria, lending interpretability to the proposed method.

TI Communication-efficient federated learning with stagewise training

DT Article
DE Federated learning; Optimization algorithm; Communication complexity;
   Convergence rate
AB The efficiency of communication across workers is a significant factor that affects the performance of federated learning. Though periodic communication strategy is applied to reduce communication rounds in training, the communication cost is still high when the training data distributions are not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) which is common in federated learning. Recently, some works introduce variance reduction to eliminate the effect caused by non-IID data among workers. Nevertheless the provable optimal communication complexity O(log(ST)) and convergence rate O(1/(ST)) cannot be achieved simultaneously, where S denotes the number of sampled workers in each round and T is the number of iterations. To deal with this dilemma, we propose an optimization algorithm SQUARFA that adopts stagewise training framework coupling with variance reduction and uses a quick-start phase in each loop. Theoretical results show that SQUARFA achieves both optimal convergence rate and communication complexity for both strongly convex objectives and non-convex objectives under PL condition, thus fills the gap mentioned above. Then, a variant of SQUARFA yields the optimal theoretical results for general non-convex objectives. We further extend the technique in SQUARFA to the large batch setting and achieve optimal communication complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms.

ID PREDICTION MODEL; VALIDATION; POLICY
AB Machine-learning (ML) methods have gained prominence in the quantitative sciences. However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. We systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based science. Through a survey of literature in fields that have adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields where leakage has been found, collectively affecting 294 papers and, in some cases, leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we introduce a detailed taxonomy of eight types of leakage, ranging from textbook errors to open research problems. We propose that researchers test for each type of leakage by filling out model info sheets, which we introduce. Finally, we conduct a reproducibility study of civil war prediction, where complex ML models are believed to vastly outperform traditional statistical models such as logistic regression (LR). When the errors are corrected, complex ML models do not perform substantively better than decades-old LR models.

Such methods can be broadly categorized into two main types: post hoc explanations and inherently interpretable algorithms. We aimed at analyzing the possible associations between COVID-19 and the push of explainable AI (XAI) to the forefront of biomed-ical research. We automatically extracted from the PubMed database biomedical XAI studies related to con-cepts of causality or explainability and manually labeled 1,603 papers with respect to XAI categories. To compare the trends pre-and post-COVID-19, we fit a change point detection model and evaluated significant changes in publication rates. We show that the advent of COVID-19 in the beginning of 2020 could be the driving factor behind an increased focus concerning XAI, playing a crucial role in accelerating an already evolving trend. Finally, we present a discussion with future societal use and impact of XAI technologies and potential future directions for those who pursue fostering clinical trust with interpretable machine learning models.

ID MODEL
AB The fast evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and the IoT gained more interest in the development of autonomous vehicles. The main challenges faced by autonomous car manufacturers are high computation costs and the lag of intelligent task management systems. The accident rates created by autonomous vehicles are increasing rapidly due to their unrestrained traffic, inaccurate location, and mapping methods. So, secure driving becomes the main concern in self-driving vehicle design. Moreover, the inadequate battery life and computation power made the system complex to minimize execution time as well as resource computation. Therefore, to handle all these complications, an intelligent task-managing system for autonomous vehicles is proposed in this paper. In this, each task is optimally executed by invoking the supervised resource predictor kernel data adaptive support vector machine-based multimodal bacterial foraging (KDASVM-MBF) method. The KDASVM-MBF intelligent task scheduling method is proposed to distribute all the tasks to the suitable processor based on central processing unit (CPU) usage and emergency. The proposed model is implemented in Python IDE-version 3.8 and examined using two multicore processors (Nvidia and AIIoT). The potential capability of the introduced type is evaluated by computing the performance methods such as response time, resource utilization, CPU utilization, execution time, prediction accuracy, and task miss rate. The experimental results reveal that the established KDASVM-MBF method accomplishes prediction accuracy of about 97% and 98% for Nvidia and AIIoT processors respectively with minimum task miss rate and execution time.

AB Violent assaults and homicides occur daily, and the number of victims of mass shootings increases every year. However, this number can be reduced with the help of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and weapon detection models, as generic object detectors have become increasingly accurate with more data for training. We present a new semi-supervised learning methodology based on conditioned cooperative student-teacher training with optimal pseudo-label generation using a novel confidence threshold search method and improving both models by conditional knowledge transfer. Furthermore, a novel firearms image dataset of 458,599 images was collected using Instagram hashtags to evaluate our approach and compare the improvements obtained using a specific unsupervised dataset instead of a general one such as ImageNet. We compared our methodology with supervised, semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques, outperforming approaches such as YOLOv5 m (up to +19.86), YOLOv5l (up to +6.52) Unbiased Teacher (up to +10.5 AP), DETReg (up to +2.8 AP) and UP-DETR (up to +1.22 AP).(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Visually secure image encryption method can provide an added dimension of protection for image compared to conventional image encryption scheme that encrypts a plain image to a noise-like cipher image. Here we introduce a novel perspective based on image transformation to perform visually secure image encryption by constructing an optical reservoir computing (ORC) system. In this paper, we first design a novel optical dynamics model to construct a dual-channel signal injection ORC system, and to provide chaotic keys when the optical dynamics model operating at chaotic states. Then, the established ORC system is used to reveal the underlying transformation relationship between a plain image and a visually meaningful image both with the same size. One important role of such relationship is to provide evidence for the determination of cipher image that allows visually meaningful image to be directly set as cipher image, prompting a high visual security of that, and another role is to facilitate the calculation of necessary decryption keys in order to obtain a high-quality decrypted image. Compared with other existing encryption methods, this work overcomes a challenge of the inability in simultaneously achieving low burden cost, high visual security of cipher image, and high quality of decrypted image, and the simulation results and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and secure. Moreover, this study also offers an inspirational implication to develop novel alternative framework with respect to the study of visually secure image encryption and will help other researchers to develop new image security techniques based on transformation methods.

AB Dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) are optimization problems with time evolution characteristics. In this type of problem, the decision variables and the state variables change over time and produce results that will impact the future. To effectively address DOPs, this paper proposes a fast density peak clustering based particle swarm optimizer for dynamic optimization (DPCPSO). The main innovations of DPCPSO contain three critical components. First, a fast density peak clustering is applied to create multiple sub-populations, which can help the algorithm locate peaks. Second, stagnation detection is used to tackle the loss of diversity. Third, an optimal particle calibration strategy which can find the optimal solution quickly in a changing environment is proposed in response to environmental changes. Moreover, the hill climbing method is applied to help the memory quickly locate new peaks if the environment changes. The performance of our proposed algorithm has been tested on Mobile Peak Benchmark (MPB), Generalized Dynamic Benchmark Generator (GDBG) and Generalized Moving Peaks Benchmark (GMPB) problems and compared with seven state-of-the-art dynamic optimization algorithms. The experimental results validate the proposed algorithm performed competitively while solving DOPs.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) models for automatic generation of narrative radiology reports from images have the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce the workload of radiologists. However, evaluating the correctness of these reports requires metrics that can capture clinically pertinent differences. In this study, we investigate the alignment between automated metrics and radiologists' scoring of errors in report generation. We address the limitations of existing metrics by proposing new metrics, RadGraph F1 and RadCliQ, which demonstrate stronger correlation with radiologists' evaluations. In addition, we analyze the failure modes of the metrics to understand their limitations and provide guidance for metric selection and interpretation. This study establishes RadGraph F1 and RadCliQ as meaningful metrics for guiding future research in radi-ology report generation.

AB Hyperparameter optimization in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) plays a vital role in ensuring the effectiveness of the models. However, with the depth of the existing CNN expanding, this task becomes very challenging due to the high-dimensional and computationally expensive characteristics. Given these difficulties, this study proposes a surrogate-assisted highly cooperative hyperparameter optimization (SHCHO) algorithm for large-scale chain-styled CNNs. SHCHO tackles the original hyperparameter optimization problem by cooperatively optimizing its subproblems. Specifically, it first decomposes the whole CNN into several overlapping sub-CNNs, which conforms to the inherent overlapping interaction structure among hyperparameters and significantly reduces the search space. The resulting hyperparameter optimization subproblems on these sub-CNNs are then coevolved collaboratively and competitively, facilitating a proper hyperparameter configuration for the whole CNN. Besides, SHCHO also employs the computationally efficient surrogate technique to assist in each subproblem optimization. As a result, the expensive computational cost can be greatly reduced. Extensive experimental results on three widely-used image classification datasets indicate that SHCHO shows competitive performance when compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both hyperparameter superiority and computational cost.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Grey prediction evolutionary algorithm (GPE) is an emerging category of meta-heuristic algorithm based on mathematical model. It generates offspring by predicting the macroscopic evolutionary trend of population series. On the contrary, the mining of local evolutionary trend are flawed. To address this imperfection, this paper introduces a quadratic function as a surrogate model to mine the local evolutionary trend of population series for the first time. Thereby an improved grey prediction evolutionary algorithm called grey prediction evolutionary algorithm with a surrogate model based on quadratic interpolation (GPE-QI) is designed. The surrogate model based on quadratic interpolation is regarded as an external auxiliary tool to mine the local evolutionary trend of population series by using currently superior individuals. Through utilizing the mined local trend information, a donor population closer to the optimal solution is formed to improve the prediction direction of the algorithm. The performance of GPE-QI is tested on CEC2019, CEC2020 benchmark functions and six engineering design problems. The experimental results demonstrate the stronger competitiveness of GPE-QI to well-established algorithms in terms of solving accuracy and convergence rate.If this paper is accepted, MATLAB codes associated with this paper will be uploaded to https://github.com/ Zhongbo-Hu/Prediction-Evolutionary-Algorithm-HOMEPAGE.

AB Practical realization of lithium-sulfur batteries requires designing optimal electrolytes with controlled dissolution of polysulfides, high ionic conductivity, and low viscosity. Computational chemistry techniques enable tuning atomistic interactions to discover electrolytes with targeted properties. Here, we introduce ComBat (Computational Database for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries), a public database of ⠁2,000 quantum-chemical and molecular dynamics properties for lithium-sulfur electrolytes composed of solvents spanning 16 chemical classes. We discuss the microscopic origins of polysulfide clustering and the diffusion mechanism of electrolyte components. Our findings reveal that polysulfide solubility cannot be determined by a single sol-vent property like dielectric constant. Rather, observed trends result from the synergistic effect of multiple factors, including solvent C/O ratio, fluorination degree, and steric hindrance effects. We propose binding energy as a proxy for Li+ dissociation, which is a property that impacts the ionic conductivity. The insights obtained in this work can serve as guiding maps to design optimal lithium-sulfur electrolyte compositions.

ID CANCER; CHALLENGES; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM
AB Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) allows screening, follow up, and diagnosis for breast tumor with high sensitivity. Accurate tumor segmentation from DCE-MRI can provide crucial information of tumor location and shape, which significantly influences the downstream clinical decisions. In this paper, we aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant to automatically segment breast tumors by capturing dynamic changes in multi-phase DCE-MRI with a spatial-temporal framework. The main advantages of our AI assistant include (1) robustness, i.e., our model can handle MR data with different phase numbers and imaging intervals, as demonstrated on a large-scale dataset from seven medical centers, and (2) efficiency, i.e., our AI assistant significantly reduces the time required for manual annotation by a factor of 20, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of physicians. More importantly, as the fundamental step to build an AI-assisted breast cancer diagnosis system, our AI assistant will promote the application of AI in more clinical diagnostic practices regarding breast cancer.

AB Rain streaks, which can be viewed as a type of noise, have the potential to destroy the structural integrity of objects within an image, leading to a dramatic degradation in the performance of advanced vision algorithms. Therefore, it is important to develop an effective deraining algorithm. There are three challenges in the current deraining task: First, it is difficult to separate rain streaks from the image background because of the complexity of rain types. Second, most of the existing methods use encoder-decoder-based structures, but the models are designed to be too bulky and inflexible to accommodate complex rain streaks. Third, many models perform the same operation for all rain types, which can reduce the generalizability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a scale constraint iterative update network which divides the network structure into feature extraction block, multi-scale constraint block, and iterative update block. In the feature extraction block, the deep mixed attention is used to extract complex rain streak features, and the mixed convolution block is used to extract the background details. The multi-scale constraint block aggregates contextual features across different scales, while the Global GateUnit captures long-range dependencies. We followed a coarse-to fine pipeline. In the iterative update block, the feature maps are updated based on features from different scales, gradually refining the image. The final optimized result is obtained by performing learnable up sampling. During the whole iteration process, the parameters are shared to reduce the complexity of the model while maintaining the performance. Additionally, We also designed a dynamic inference mechanism, which dynamically selects the number of iterations for different types of rain streaks, effectively enhancing the generalization of the model. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rain datasets, as well as a raindrop dataset. The results of our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deraining methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization ability.

AB B factors provide critical insight into protein dynamics. Predicting B factors of an atom in new proteins remains challenging as it is impacted by their neighbors in Euclidean space. Previous learning methods developed have resulted in low Pearson correlation coefficients beyond the training set due to their limited ability to capture the effect of neighboring atoms. With the advances in deep learning methods, we develop a sequence based model that is tested on 2,442 proteins and outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 30%. We find that the model learns that the B factor of a site is prominently affected by atoms within a 12-15 A radius, which is in excellent agreement with cutoffs from protein network models. The ablation study revealed that the B factor can largely be predicted from the primary sequence alone. Based on the abovementioned points, our model lays a foundation for predicting other properties that are correlated with the B factor.

AB Several classification methods in the task of electroencephalogram (EEG) classification represent input features as symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. By translating the data into a Riemannian space, the classification methods have obtained superior performance; however, the high dimensionality of the data typically results in low computational efficiency and degraded classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dimension selection method named dimension selection for SPD matrices on Riemannian manifold (DSSR). DSSR can eliminate redundant dimensions for SPD matrices in the Riemannian space based on the framework of particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, we treat one column of the SPD matrix and its corresponding row as a group, where upon the PSO is used to find optimal groups. Next, we use Riemannian classifiers to evaluate the goodness of the selected groups. Finally, the dimension selected SPD matrices are classified by the generalized learning Riemannian space quantization (GLRSQ). Experimental results on two motor imagery datasets show the superior performance of the proposed methods over EEG classification. Neuroscience experiments prove that the optimal dimensions selected by our proposed method are consistent with the findings of brain science research.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a hybrid technique is proposed for analyzing the performance of buck converters with fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) controllers. The hybrid approach is a combination of Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA) and Golden Jackal Optimization (GJO). The update behavior of Golden Jackal Optimization2 is enhanced with Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA) therefore it is called the improved GJO (IGJO) technique. The power converters are hard to manage based on their nonlinear nature and therefore the search for smart and effectual controllers is ongoing and continual. In current years, fractional order controllers have shown greater efficiency in power electronic systems. The IGJO technique is used to establish the optimum design of a fractional order proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for the buck converter. The FOPID controller parameters are considered to diminish several performance metrics, with a particular focus on the Integral Squared Error (ISE). The proposed method is performed in the MATLAB, and its execution is analyzed by using the existing methods. From the simulation result, the proposed method reduces the error more effectively than existing methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous affect recognition from facial images aims to estimate the values of multiple affective dimensions from a facial image sequence. To leverage relevant information between multiple affective dimensions, multitask learning has been used in the estimation of continuous affective states. Most of the existing multitask continuous affect recognition methods focus on designing elaborate multitask networks. Meanwhile, a few research works consider using multitask training strategies for continuous affect recognition. In general, existing multitask continuous affect recognition methods face the problem of unstable training effects. In this work, to improve the stability of multitask learning, we propose an ensemble learning-enhanced multitask network architecture for continuous affect recognition. In addition, we introduce a novel adaptive weighted loss-based multitask learning strategy to effectively train the proposed multitask continuous affect recognition model. Experimental results, on the RECOLA, SEMAINE and AFEW-VA datasets for continuous affect recognition, demonstrate the potential of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB The spatial organization of various cell types within the tissue microenvironment is a key element for the for-mation of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. Here, we present S3-CIMA, a weakly supervised convolutional neural network model that enables the detection of dis-ease-specific microenvironment compositions from high-dimensional proteomic imaging data. We demon-strate the utility of this approach by determining cancer outcome-and cellular-signaling-specific spatial cell -state compositions in highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy data of the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we use S3-CIMA to identify disease-onset-specific changes of the pancreatic tissue microenvironment in type 1 diabetes using imaging mass-cytometry data. We evaluated S3-CIMA as a powerful tool to discover novel disease-associated spatial cellular interactions from currently available and future spatial biology datasets.

AB To be able to schedule the charging demand of an electric vehicle fleet using smart charging, insight is required into different charging session characteristics of the considered fleet, including the number of charging sessions, their charging demand and arrival and departure times. The use of forecasting techniques can reduce the uncertainty about these charging session characteristics, but since these characteristics are interrelated, this is not straightforward. Remarkably, forecasting frameworks that cover all required characteristics to schedule the charging of an electric vehicle fleet are absent in scientific literature. To cover this gap, this study proposes a novel approach for forecasting the charging requirements of an electric vehicle fleet, which can be used as input to schedule their aggregated charging demand. In the first step of this approach, the charging session characteristics of an electric vehicle fleet are translated to three parameter values that describe a virtual battery. Subsequently, optimal predictor variable and hyperparameter sets are determined. These serve as input for the last step, in which the virtual battery parameter values are forecasted. The approach has been tested on a real world case study of public charging stations, considering a high number of predictor variables and different forecasting models (Multivariate Linear Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbors). The results show that the different virtual battery parameters can be forecasted with high accuracy, reaching R2 scores up to 0.98 when considering 400 charging stations. In addition, the results indicate that the forecasting performance of all considered models is somehow similar and that only a low number of predictor variables are required to adequately forecast aggregated electric vehicle charging characteristics.

AB Most current deep learning based approaches for image segmentation require annotations of large datasets, which limits their application in clinical practice. We observe a mismatch between the voxelwise ground-truth that is required to optimize an objective at a voxel level and the commonly used, less time-consuming clinical annotations seeking to characterize the most important information about the patient (diameters, counts, etc.).In this study, we propose to bridge this gap for the case of multiple nested star-shaped objects (e.g., a blood vessel lumen and its outer wall) by optimizing a deep learning model based on diameter annotations. This is achieved by extracting in a differentiable manner the boundary points of the objects at training time, and by using this extraction during the backpropagation. We evaluate the proposed approach on segmentation of the carotid artery lumen and wall from multisequence MR images, thus reducing the annotation burden to only four annotated landmarks required to measure the diameters in the direction of the vessel's maximum narrowing. Our experiments show that training based on diameter annotations produces state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentations and performs reasonably compared to full supervision.We made our code publicly available at https://gitlab.com/radiology/aim/carotid-artery-image-analysis/ nested-star-shaped-objects.

ID GIBBS PHENOMENON
AB Time series forecasting (TSF) is a challenging problem in various real-world scenarios, such as industry, energy, weather, traffic, economics, and earthquake warning. TSF demands the model to have a high prediction accuracy. Despite the promising performance of deep learning-based methods in TSF tasks, mainstream forecasting models may sometimes produce results that deviate from the actual ground truth. Our analysis suggests that this may be attributed to the models' limited ability to capture the frequency information that is abundantly present in real-world datasets. Currently, the Fourier Transform (FT) is the most widely used method for extracting frequency information, but it has some issues that lead to poor model performance, such as high -frequency noise caused by the Gibbs phenomenon and computational overhead of the inverse transformation in the FT-IFT process. To address these issues, we propose a novel frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism (FECAM) that models frequency interdependencies between channels based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which inherently mitigates the high-frequency noise caused by problematic periodicity during Fourier Transform. This approach improves the model's capability to extract frequency features and resolves computational overhead concerns that arise from inverse transformations. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a novel frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism that models frequency interdependencies between channels based on DCT, which improves the model's capability to extract frequency features and resolves computational overhead concerns that arise from inverse transformations; (2) We theoretically prove that our method mitigates the Gibbs phenomenon, which introduces high frequency noise during Fourier Transform. We demonstrate that the result of 1D GAP linearly varies with the lowest frequency component of 1D DCT; (3) We demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed method FECAM by embedding it into other networks, resulting in significant performance improvements when compared to the original model, with only a minor increase in parameters. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on six different real-world TSF datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed model and compare it with several existing state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that the FECAM model is superior to these models in terms of accuracy, making it a promising solution for TSF in diverse real-world scenarios. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/Zero-coder/FECAM.

AB This paper introduces a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model aimed at designing a dependable closed-loop supply chain that can function effectively despite disruptions. The model incorporates several strategies to reduce the risks associated with random facility disruptions. First, the concept of p-robustness criterion is employed, which sets upper bounds on the cost in various disruption scenarios to protect against disruptions. To accommodate for the varying levels of reliability of facilities, the network consists of two categories of infrastructure: reliable and defective hybrid infrastructure. Thirdly, a sharing strategy is proposed to mitigate for the capacity loss at unreliable facilities by permitting transportation of products from reliable facilities to unreliable facilities. Additionally, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is devised for the MINLP model efficiently. The efficacy of the model and the tailored algorithm is evaluated by means of computational experiments. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is ultimately performed to furnish managers with meaningful insights. For example, the sharing strategies demonstrate a significant decrease of total cost. This paper contributes to enhancing resilience in logistics networks, ensuring their reliable performance even in the face of disruptions.

AB Congestion is a bane of urban life that affects a large share of the population on a daily basis. Thus, congestion gets tremendous attention from city stakeholders, residents, and researchers. The key challenge to preventing congestion is to accurately predict the traffic status (e.g., speed) of a particular road segment which is greatly affected by many factors, such as spatial, temporal, and road conditions. Although several research studies have focused on preventing congestion, most prediction-based literature came short of accurate predictions regarding precision and time efficiency regarding large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach called GRIZZLY. This approach utilizes an improved Sequence to Sequence Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory Neural Network model that integrates data pre-processing techniques such as normalization and embeddings to improve traffic prediction accuracy. Carried out experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, namely PEMS-BAY and METR-LA, pinpointing that the proposed approach outperformed the pioneering competitors from time-series-based and hybrid neural network-based baselines in terms of the agreed-on evaluation criteria (precision and computation time).

AB An in-depth understanding of uncertainty is the first step to making effective decisions under uncertainty. Machine/deep learning (ML/DL) has been hugely leveraged to solve complex problems involved with pro-cessing high-dimensional data. However, reasoning and quantifying different uncertainties to achieve effective decision-making have been much less explored in ML/DL than in other Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains. In particular, belief/evidence theories have been studied in Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) since the 1960s to reason and measure uncertainties to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Based on our in-depth literature review, only a few studies have leveraged mature uncertainty research in belief/evidence theories in ML/DL to tackle complex problems under different types of uncertainty. Our present survey paper discusses major belief theories and their core ideas dealing with uncertainty causes and types and quantifying them, along with the discussions of their applicability in ML/DL. Particularly, we discuss three main approaches leveraging belief theories in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Evidential DNNs, Fuzzy DNNs, and Rough DNNs, in terms of their uncertainty causes, types, and quantification methods along with their applicability in diverse problem domains. Through an in-depth understanding of the extensive survey on this topic, we discuss insights, lessons learned, limitations of the current state-of-the-art bridging belief theories and ML/DL, and future research directions. This paper conducts an extensive survey by bridging belief theories and deep learning in reasoning and quantifying uncertainty to help researchers initiate uncertainty and decision-making research.

TI SWINN: Efficient nearest neighbor search in sliding windows using graphs
SO INFORMATION FUSION

DT Article
DE Nearest neighbor search; Sliding window; FIFO; Proximity query; Graph
AB Nearest neighbor search (NNS) is one of the main concerns in data stream applications since similarity queries can be used in multiple scenarios. Online NNS is usually performed on a sliding window by lazily scanning every element currently stored in the window. This paper proposes Sliding Window-based Incremental Nearest Neighbors (SWINN), a graph-based online search index algorithm for speeding up NNS in potentially never-ending and dynamic data stream tasks. Our proposal broadens the application of online NNS-based solutions, as even moderately large data buffers become impractical to handle when a naive NNS strategy is selected. SWINN enables efficient handling of large data buffers by using an incremental strategy to build and update a search graph supporting any distance metric. Vertices can be added and removed from the search graph. To keep the graph reliable for search queries, lightweight graph maintenance routines are run. According to experimental results, SWINN is significantly faster than performing a naive complete scan of the data buffer while keeping competitive search recall values. We also apply SWINN to online classification and regression tasks and show that our proposal is effective against popular online machine learning algorithms.

AB Machine learning based decision making systems in safety critical areas place high demands on the accuracy and generalization ability of the underlying model. A common strategy to deal with uncertainties and possible mistakes is offered by learning with reject option, i.e. a model can refrain from prediction in ambiguous cases and leave the decision to a human expert. Yet, as for the models themselves, human decision-making is hampered by the fact that reject options are often implemented as black-box rules: Experts cannot readily understand the reasons for rejection.In this work, we propose a model-agnostic framework that enriches classification with reject option by explanation mechanisms. More specifically, we combine conformal prediction as a popular mathematically based technology of certainty estimation with local surrogates derived for the region of interest. This allows us to provide local explanations in terms of example-based explanation methods, including counterfactual, semi-factual, and factual methods. We demonstrate the performance of this technology through a series of benchmarks using 6 different data sets; the associated code is open source.1

AB Malaria is a significant public health concern, with -95% of cases occurring in Africa, but accurate and timely diagnosis is problematic in remote and low-income areas. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence-based object detection system for malaria diagnosis (AIDMAN). In this system, the YOLOv5 model is used to detect cells in a thin blood smear. An attentional aligner model (AAM) is then applied for cellular classification that consists of multi-scale features, a local context aligner, and multi-scale attention. Finally, a convolutional neural network classifier is applied for diagnosis using blood-smear images, reducing interference caused by false positive cells. The results demonstrate that AIDMAN handles interference well, with a diagnostic ac-curacy of 98.62% for cells and 97% for blood-smear images. The prospective clinical validation accuracy of 98.44% is comparable to that of microscopists. AIDMAN shows clinically acceptable detection of malaria parasites and could aid malaria diagnosis, especially in areas lacking experienced parasitologists and equipment.

AB University Research & Development (R&D) laboratories are facilities used for research and manufactur-ing activities in engineering and basic science fields. Various filling materials are used in plastic R&D laboratories to improve the mechanical properties of thermoplastics or to recycle waste materials. The use of filling materials causes changes in plastic production parameters. This study dealt with the risks arising from extrusion, injection and shredder in a plastic injection laboratory, which led to the inability to manufacture the appropriate product under a holistic methodology. The proposed holistic methodology merges the concepts of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM), and a rule-based three-hierarchical Bayesian network (RB-THBN). First, 15 root risks have been identified under a three-stage hierarchy with the support of laboratory decision makers. Then, questionnaires were created using the FMEA concept. The importance values (degree of belief-DoB) of three different FMEA parameters (severity, occurrence and detection) by experts for each risk have been calculated with FBWM. And finally, the RB-THBN has been created, and the final risk values have been computed using the linear utility function for the network. The system has been analyzed via a Bayesian modeling software. A validity test and a control measures planning has also been executed. According to the results, the highest root risk has been determined as "E2-The prepared mixture is not homogeneous"with a crisp risk score of 0.639559. In addition, "Failure due to extrusion"has been determined as the highest risk category with a score of 0.564059. It was discussed in detail that these risks arise from homogenization and how the used mixture should be homogenized. A comparative study among traditional FMEA, FMEA extended under FBWM and the proposed approach is performed to observe the differences in final ranking of root risks and to highlight the arguments that strengthen the advantages of the proposed method over the other two.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID MODELS
AB Bayesian neural networks harness the power of Bayesian inference which provides an approach to neural learning that not only focuses on accuracy but also uncertainty quantification. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods implement Bayesian inference by sampling from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. In the case of Bayesian neural networks, the model parameters refer to weights and biases. MCMC methods suffer from scalability issues in large models, such as deep neural networks with thousands to millions of parameters. In this paper, we present a Bayesian ensemble learning framework that utilizes gradient boosting by combining multiple shallow neural networks (base learners) that are trained by MCMC sampling. We present two Bayesian gradient boosting strategies that employ simple neural networks as base learners with Langevin MCMC sampling. We evaluate the performance of these methods on various classification and time -series prediction problems. We demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the prediction accuracy of canonical gradient boosting while providing uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the respective methods scale well when the size of the dataset and model increases.

DE Clustering approximation; Distributed clustering ensemble; Multiple
   random samples; Automatic clustering; Ensemble learning
ID K-MEANS; ALGORITHM; DENSITY; NUMBER
AB In big data clustering exploration, the situation is paradoxical because there is no prior or insufficient domain knowledge. Moreover, clustering a big dataset is a challenging task in distributed computing framework. To address this, we propose a new distributed clustering approximation framework for big data with quality guarantees. This innovative framework uses multiple disjoint random samples instead of a single random sample to compute an ensemble result as the estimation of the true result of the entire big dataset. To begin, we modeled a large dataset as a collection of random sample data blocks stored in a distributed file system. Henceafter, a subset of data blocks is randomly selected, and to generate the component clustering results, the serial clustering algorithm is executed in parallel on the distributed computing framework. In each selected random sample, the number of clusters and initial centroids is identified using a density peak-based I-niceDP clustering algorithm, and then the k-means sweep refines them. Since the random samples are disjoint and traditional consensus functions cannot be used, we propose two new methods, a graph similarity and a naturally inspired firefly-based algorithm, to integrate the component clustering results into the final ensemble result. The entire clustering process is displayed through systematic support, extensive measures of clusterability, and quality evaluation. The methods are verified in a series of experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods vividly (1) recognize the correct number of clusters by analyzing a subset of samples and (2) exhibit better scalability, efficiency, and clustering stability.

AB Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second common cause of blindness following diabetic retinopathy. The manual screening of fundus images to detect RVO is time consuming. Deep-learning techniques have been used for screening RVO due to their outstanding performance in many applications. However, unlike other images, medical images have smaller lesions, which require a more elaborate approach. To provide patients with an accurate diagnosis, followed by timely and effective treatment, we developed an intelligent method for automatic RVO screening on fundus images. Swin Transformer learns the hierarchy of low-to high-level features like the convolutional neural network. However, Swin Transformer extracts features from fundus images through attention modules, which pay more attention to the interrelationship between the features and each other. The model is more universal, does not rely entirely on the data itself, and focuses not only on local information but has a diffusion mechanism from local to global. To suppress overfitting, we adopt a regularization strategy, label smoothing, which uses one-hot to add noise to reduce the weight of the categories of true sample labels when calculating the loss function. The choice of different models using a 5-fold cross-validation on our own datasets indicates that Swin Transformer performs better. The accuracy of classifying all datasets is 98.75 & PLUSMN; 0.000, and the accuracy of identifying MRVO, CRVO, BRVO, and normal, using the method proposed in the paper, is 94.49 & PLUSMN; 0.094, 99.98 & PLUSMN; 0.015, 98.88 & PLUSMN; 0.08, and 99.42 & PLUSMN; 0.012, respectively. The method will be useful to diagnose RVO and help decide grade through fundus images, which has the potency to provide patients with further diagnosis and treatment.

AB High-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) models of tooth-bone structures are valuable for virtual dental treatment planning; however, they require integrating data from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral scans (IOS) using methods that are either error-prone or time-consuming. Hence, this study presents Deep Dental Multimodal Fusion (DDMF), an automatic multimodal framework that reconstructs 3D tooth-bone structures using CBCT and IOS. Specifically, the DDMF framework comprises CBCT and IOS segmentation modules as well as a multimodal reconstruction module with novel pixel representation learning architectures, prior knowledge-guided losses, and geometry-based 3D fusion techniques. Experiments on real-world large-scale datasets revealed that DDMF achieved superior segmentation performance on CBCT and IOS, achieving a 0.17 mm average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) for 3D fusion with a substantial processing time reduction. Additionally, clinical applicability studies have demonstrated DDMF's potential for accurately simulating tooth bone structures throughout the orthodontic treatment process.

DT Article
DE Active learning; Automated optical inspection; Label quality control
AB Training deep neural networks requires a large number of labeled samples, which are typically provided by crowdsourced workers or professionals at a high cost. To obtain qualified labels, samples need to be relabeled for inspection to control the quality of the labels, which further increases the cost. Active learning methods aim to select the most valuable samples for labeling to reduce labeling costs. We designed a practical active learning method that adaptively allocates labeling resources to the most valuable unlabeled samples and the most likely mislabeled labeled samples, thus significantly reducing the overall labeling cost. We prove that the probability of our proposed method labeling more than one sample from any redundant sample set in the same batch is less than 1/k, where k is the number of the k-fold experiment used in the method, thus significantly reducing the labeling resources wasted on redundant samples. Our proposed method achieves the best level of results on benchmark datasets, and it performs well in an industrial application of automatic optical inspection.

AB Resource sharing between multiple workloads has become a prominent practice among cloud service providers, motivated by demand for improved resource utilization and reduced cost of ownership. Effective resource sharing, however, remains an open challenge due to the adverse effects that resource contention can have on high-priority, user-facing workloads with strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Although recent approaches have demonstrated promising results, those works remain largely impractical in public cloud environments since workloads are not known in advance and may only run for a brief period, thus prohibiting offline learning and significantly hindering online learning. In this paper, we propose RAPID, a novel framework for fast, fully-online resource allocation policy learning in highly dynamic operating environments. RAPID leverages lightweight QoS predictions, enabled by domain-knowledge-inspired techniques for sample efficiency and bias reduction, to decouple control from conventional feedback sources and guide policy learning at a rate orders of magnitude faster than prior work. Evaluation on a real-world server platform with representative cloud workloads confirms that RAPID can learn stable resource allocation policies in minutes, as compared with hours in prior state-of-the-art, while improving QoS by 9.0x and increasing best-effort workload performance by 19%-43%.

DT Article
AB The availability of large-scale electronic health record datasets has led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for clinical risk prediction that help improve patient care. However, existing studies have shown that AI models suffer from severe performance decay after several years of deployment, which might be caused by various temporal dataset shifts. When the shift occurs, we have access to large-scale pre-shift data and small-scale post-shift data that are not enough to train new models in the post-shift environment. In this study, we propose a new method to address the issue. We reweight patients from the pre-shift environment to mitigate the distribution shift between pre-and post-shift environments. Moreover, we adopt a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss to force the models to learn similar patient representations in pre-and post-shift environments. Our experimental results show that our model efficiently mitigates temporal shifts, improving prediction performance.

AB Accurate segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images is crucial for reliable diagnosis of diseases and organ morphometry. In recent years, convolutional encoder-decoder solutions have achieved substantial progress in the field of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the inherent bias in the convolution operations, prior models mainly focus on local visual cues formed by the neighboring pixels, but fail to fully model the long-range contextual dependencies. In this article, we propose a novel Transformer-based Attention Guided Network called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip connection are designed to jointly enhance the performance of the semantical segmentation architecture. Inspired by Transformer, the self-aware attention (SAA) module with Transformer Self Attention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions among encoder features. Moreover, we also use additional multi-scale skip connections between decoder blocks to aggregate the upsampled features with different semantic scales. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate the loss of fine details caused by the stacking of convolution layers and the consecutive sampling operations, finally improving the segmentation quality of medical images. Extensive experiments were conducted on multiple medical image segmentation datasets from various imaging modalities, which demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Although degradation modeling has been widely applied to use multiple sensor signals to monitor the degradation process and predict the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of operating machinery units, three challenging issues remain. One challenge is that units in engineering cases usually work under multiple operational conditions, causing the distribution of sensor signals to vary over conditions. It remains unexplored to characterize time-varying conditions as a distribution shift problem. The second challenge is that sensor signal fusion and degradation status modeling are separated into two independent steps in most of the existing methods, which ignores the intrinsic correlation between the two parts. The last challenge is how to find an accurate health index (HI) of units using previous knowledge of degradation. To tackle these issues, this article proposes an adaptation-aware interactive learning (AAIL) approach for degradation modeling. First, a condition-invariant HI is developed to handle time-varying operation conditions. Second, an interactive framework based on the fusion and degradation model is constructed, which naturally integrates a supervised learner and an unsupervised learner. To estimate the model parameters of AAIL, we propose an interactive training algorithm that shares learned degradation and fusion information during the model training process. A case study that uses the degradation data set of aircraft engines demonstrates that the proposed AAIL outperforms related benchmark methods.

AB The key obstacle to the realization of a scalable quantum computer is overcoming environmental and control errors. Topological quantum computation attracts great attention because it emerges as one of the most promising approaches to solving these problems. Various theoretical schemes for building topological quantum computation have been proposed. However, experimental implementation has always been a great challenge because it has proved to be extremely difficult to create and manipulate topological qubits in real systems. Therefore, topological quantum computation has not been realized in experiments yet. Herein, the first experimental simulation of topological quantum computation with classical circuits is reported. Based on the proposed new scheme with circuits, not only Majorana-like edge states are simulated experimentally, but also T junctions are constructed for simulating the braiding process. Furthermore, the feasibility of simulated topological quantum computing through a set of one- and two-qubit unitary operations is demonstrated. Finally, the simulation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that simulated topological quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. The developed circuit-based topological quantum-computing simulator can provide important references for developing future topological quantum circuits.

AB Learning a latent embedding to understand the underlying nature of data distribution is often formulated in Euclidean spaces with zero curvature. However, the success of the geometry constraints, posed in the embedding space, indicates that curved spaces might encode more structural information, leading to better discriminative power and hence richer representations. In this work, we investigate the benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalous, open-set, or out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in data. This is achieved by considering embeddings via three geometry constraints, namely, spherical geometry (with positive curvature), hyperbolic geometry (with negative curvature), or mixed geometry (with both positive and negative curvatures). Three geometric constraints can be chosen interchangeably in a unified design, given the task at hand. Tailored for the embeddings in the curved space, we also formulate functions to compute the anomaly score. Two types of geometric modules (i.e., geometric-in-one (GiO) and geometric-in-two (GiT) models) are proposed to plug in the original Euclidean classifier, and anomaly scores are computed from the curved embeddings. We evaluate the resulting designs under a diverse set of visual recognition scenarios, including image detection (multiclass OOD detection and one-class anomaly detection) and segmentation (multiclass anomaly segmentation and one-class anomaly segmentation). The empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposal through consistent improvement over various scenarios. The code is made available at https://github.com/JHome1/GiO-GiT.

AB Moving object detection is one of the key applications of video surveillance. Deep convolutional neural networks have gained increasing attention in the field of video surveillance due to their effective feature learning ability. The performance of deep neural networks is often affected by the characteristics of videos like poor illumination and inclement weather conditions. It is important to design an innovative architecture of deep neural networks to deal with the videos effectively. Here, the convolutional layers for the networks require to be in an appropriate number and it's important to determine the number. In this study, we propose a customized deep convolutional encoder-decoder network, say CEDSegNet, for moving object detection in a video sequence. Here, the CEDSegNet is based on SegNet, and its encoder and decoder parts are chosen to be two. By customizing the SegNet with two encoder and decoder parts, the proposed CEDSegNet improves detection performance, where its parameters are reduced to an extent. The two encoder and decoder parts function towards generating feature maps preserving the fine details of object pixels in videos. The proposed CEDSegNet is tested on multiple video sequences of the CDNet dataset2012. The results obtained using CEDSegNet for moving object detection in the video frames are interpreted qualitatively. Further, the performance of CEDSegNet is evaluated using several quantitative indices. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the performance of CEDSegNet is superior to the state-of-the-network models, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18 and ResNet50.

AB Nowadays, machine learning tools and, in particular, classification methods are often used to diagnose COVID-19 cases. However, these methods use a single view of the dataset and assume that the labels of the datasets are known in advance. Due to the extensive use of COVID-19 and the enormous amount of patient data whose labels are unknown, unsupervised learning may be useful in evaluating these photographs. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we present an improved and generic method for direct multi-view clustering. Second, we apply this method to unsupervised clustering of chest X-ray images. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unsupervised multi-view clustering to chest X-ray images. We can use an unsupervised learning paradigm and benefit from the wealth of unlabeled data without relying on human experts to label a large number of images. Here, we present an improved version of a recently developed direct method that estimates both nonnegative cluster indices and spectral embeddings. The proposed model includes two types of constraints in addition to the advantages of this method: (i) consistent smoothing of cluster labels across all views and (ii) an orthogonality constraint on the nonnegative embedding matrix (cluster assignment). The COVIDx dataset with three classes is used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Chest X-ray images were clustered into different classes with promising results. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy, other image datasets are used to evaluate the proposed clustering method.

AB Non-contact gesture recognition is a novel form of human-computer interaction. It has broad prospects in many applications, such as Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality, smart homes and intelligent medical systems. Therefore, it has become a research hotspot in recent years. This paper investigates a lightweight micro-motion gesture recognition method based on Multiple Input and Multiple Output millimeter wave radar. We employ TI's MMWCAS radar, comprising four cascaded AWR1243 radar boards, to collect gesture data. During the data pre-processing stage, we extract the Range-time Map, Doppler-time Map, Azimuth-time Map and Elevation-time Map of the dynamic gestures to characterize the dynamic motion features. These maps are then simplified into a one-dimensional vector to reduce data volume. We propose an 8HBi-GRU model, which combines the Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, to identify twelve types of micro-motion gestures using feature vectors. The model achieves an accuracy of 98.24%, with precision and recall rates exceeding 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, for ten of the gesture types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 8HBi-GRU model achieves lightweight gesture recognition rapidly and requires minimal storage space compared to image-based deep learning methods.

AB As the pagan classical world was subsumed into Christianity sexually hyperactive gods and goddesses transmuted into saints, their former statues that glorified the perfection of their bodies smashed into pieces and reimagined as austere two-dimensional icons to be worshipped by the new faithful. That dualistic and polemic narrative, where the soul's purpose was to annihilate the body, survives today in the distinction between software and hardware, algorithms and robots, the former as the "ghosts" that animate the empty vessels, the "machines". But how does this narrative impact our cultural and social fantasies in the twenty-first century as we accelerate toward coexisting, uniting, or merging with intelligent artifacts? How does "humanness" blur when it is claimed by no-biological human-like entities too, or when humans augment their perception, consciousness and physical power through genetic engineering, drugs, or software and mechanical prostheses? Suppose we are destined to remake ourselves in the image of our ancient gods. Will it be through the embodiment of technologies in the physical reality, or through the complete disembodiment of our minds inside virtual worlds?

AB Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has recently emerged as an effective treatment for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Accurate prediction of postoperative conduction disturbance after TAVR is crucial for successful surgery planning. Most current risk prediction models for conduction disturbance rely on monomodal data methods, such as images. However, predicting conduction disturbance based on multimodal features becomes a challenge. We propose a new memory-augmented graph neural network (MemGCN) to deal with this challenge. The GCN in the proposed network is constructed by taking the patient's image features as nodes' features and creating the edges based on the patient's clinical features, thus effectively fusing the patients' images and clinical feature information. Moreover, the traditional GCN model trains feature extractors and GCNs independently due to limited computing resources, which can negatively impact the feature learning process. We introduce the memory bank and propose a local update learning algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the proposed method connects the feature extractors and GCN through a memory bank. The CNN module extracts patients' features from their ECG images and updates the memory bank. The GCN constructs the graph using the patients' characteristics in the memory bank as node features. In this way, the node features are cached in the memory bank and gradually updated at each optimization iteration so that the feature extractors and GCN are optimized jointly. The experiments on a real-world TAVR dataset show the proposed method's superior performance. It improves the prediction accuracy by over 4% compared to the traditional GCN model. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method to other multimodal data analysis tasks, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method on an ocular disease intelligent recognition benchmark. The proposed method achieves competitive prediction performance.

AB Billions of documents in data sheet format are shared between various organizations across the globe on a daily basis. The essential information in these documents is presented in tabular format. Extracting and assimilating this information can help organizations make data-driven decisions. Solutions for detecting tables in document images have been well explored. Thus, in this work, we propose TableStrRec, a deep learning-based approach to recognize the structure of such detected tables by detecting rows and columns. TableStrRec comprises two Cascade R-CNN architectures, each with a deformable backbone and Complete IOU loss to improve their detection performance. One architecture detects and classifies rows as regular rows (rows without a merged cell) and irregular rows (groups of regular rows that share a merged cell). The second architecture detects and classifies columns as regular columns (columns without a merged cell) and irregular columns (groups of regular columns that share a merged cell). Both architectures work in parallel to provide the results in a single inference. We show that utilizing TableStrRec to detect four classes of objects improves the table structure recognition performance on three public test sets. We achieve 90.5% and 89.6% weighted average F1 scores on the ICDAR2013 test set for rows and columns, respectively. On the TabStructDB test set, we achieve 72.7% and 78.5% weighted average F1 score for rows and columns, respectively. We also evaluate the proposed method under the FinTabNet dataset using the structure-only TEDS score, achieving 98.34%, which can outperform most state-of-the-art benchmark models.

AB Grid cells play a principal role in enabling cognitive representations of ambient environments. The key property of these cells-the regular arrangement of their firing fields-is commonly viewed as a means for establishing spatial scales or encoding specific locations. However, using grid cells' spiking outputs for deducing geometric orderliness proves to be a strenuous task due to fairly irregular activation patterns triggered by the animal's sporadic visits to the grid fields. This article addresses statistical mechanisms enabling emergent regularity of grid cell firing activity from the perspective of percolation theory. Using percolation phenomena for modeling the effect of the rat's moves through the lattices of firing fields sheds new light on the mechanisms of spatial information processing, spatial learning, path integration, and establishing spatial metrics. It is also shown that physiological parameters required for spiking percolation match the experimental range, including the characteristic 2/3 ratio between the grid fields' size and the grid spacing, pointing at a biological viability of the approach.

TI Learning Intention-Aware Policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; CURIOSITY
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides an agent with an optimal policy so as to maximize the cumulative rewards. The policy defined in DRL mainly depends on the state, historical memory, and policy model parameters. However, we humans usually take actions according to our own intentions, such as moving fast or slow, besides the elements included in the traditional policy models. In order to make the action-choosing mechanism more similar to humans and make the agent to select actions that incorporate intentions, we propose an intention-aware policy learning method in this letter To formalize this process, we first define an intention-aware policy by incorporating the intention information into the policy model, which is learned by maximizing the cumulative rewards with the mutual information (MI) between the intention and the action. Then we derive an approximation of the MI objective that can be optimized efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the intention-aware policy in the classical MuJoCo control task and the multigoal continuous chain walking task.

TI Transfer Learning With Singular Value Decomposition of Multichannel

ID REGULARIZATION
AB The task of transfer learning using pretrained convolutional neural networks is considered. We propose a convolution-SVD layer to analyze the convolution operators with a singular value decomposition computed in the Fourier domain. Singular vectors extracted from the source domain are transferred to the target domain, whereas the singular values are fine-tuned with a target data set. In this way, dimension reduction is achieved to avoid overfitting, while some flexibility to fine-tune the convolution kernels is maintained. We extend an existing convolution kernel reconstruction algorithm to allow for a reconstruction from an arbitrary set of learned singular values. A generalization bound for a single convolution-SVD layer is devised to show the consistency between training and testing errors. We further introduce a notion of transfer learning gap. We prove that the testing error for a single convolution-SVD layer is bounded in terms of the gap, which motivates us to develop a regularization model with the gap as the regularizer. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in solving classification problems and the influence of various parameters. In particular, the regularization is shown to yield a significantly higher prediction accuracy.

AB Images are easily polluted by noise in the process of acquisition and transmission, which will affect people's understanding and utilization of knowledge and information in images. Therefore, image denoising, as a classic problem, has received extensive attention from researchers. At present, many image denoising methods based on deep learning have been proposed and achieved good performance. However, most existing methods are insufficient in acquiring and utilizing crucial information in the image when removing noise under complex image denoising tasks such as blind denoising and real-world denoising, resulting in the loss of fine details in the reconstructed image. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel image denoising algorithm combining attention mechanism and residual UNet network, named Att-ResUNet. Specifically, we propose a novel UNet-based image denoising framework, which employs residual enhancement blocks and skip connections to form global-local residuals, which can fuse multi-scale global context and local features to more thoroughly capture and remove hidden noise in the image. A channel attention mechanism is introduced, which can better focus on the crucial information in the image and improve the denoising performance. In addition, we use adaptive average pooling for down-sampling, which can preserve more image structure information, reduce the loss of edge details, and adopt a residual learning strategy to enhance the learning and expressive capabilities of the denoising model. Extensive experiments on several publicly available standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over 15 state-of-the-art methods and achieve excellent denoising performance. Compared with mainstream methods, our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by up to 0.76 dB and 1.10 dB on PSNR evaluation metrics on BSD68 and Set12 datasets, respectively. Notably, our method achieves an average PSNR value of 37.88 dB on the CC dataset in real-world denoising experiments, a significant improvement of 2.14 dB over the most advanced methods.

AB The significant growth of social media and online websites helps to garner a significant amount of healthcare data and contributes toward the development of the healthcare industry. Authorized health assets, which include specialized healthcare authorities, medical professionals, substandard monitoring and diagnosing equipment, and pharmaceuticals, became insufficient during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2019. Social networks have played a significant role in selling drugs during those times. However, the risk of drug abuse is increased, and also there occurs several challenges in the management and detection of drug activities. This research will focus on identifying relevant features in the drug database by developing a new target label model using deep learning approaches. This helps in avoiding unbalanced data, which in turn results in enhanced overall performance. The objective of this work is to address uneven classification performance by using social media comments as input in order to improve the accuracy of the training model. A new powerful hybrid machine learning method to extract clinical terms from customer feedback and learn the system by categorizing medical conditions and drug names is developed in this work. The Improved Faster Mask-Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (IFM-RCNN), along with natural language processing, is trained with 4589 hand-labeled examples with 18,465 synthetically generated tweets. The suggested IFM-RCNN model attained an (area under the ROC curve) AUC of 0.98 and 0.94, a precision of 86.95% and an accuracy of 92.65%, respectively. The results show an enhanced capacity to anticipate drug activities with minimal differentiation. The proposed methodology has improved performance. It can be utilized for clinical applications, and the findings revealed that the suggested model can be applied in real-time applications.

AB Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is one of the non-parametric approaches for evaluating efficiency. The present paper investigates a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) model for solving DEA problems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no attempt for this kind of problem using RNN. Thus, this paper is going to show the effectiveness of RNN models for solving DEA problems. As a matter of fact, we give a novel RNN model to solve a general linear programming problem. Moreover, the stability in the sense of Lyapunov for the developed RNN model is proved. Finally, to show the performance of the method we consider a general case model and a case study on Iran's Olympic Sports Caravan and solve with the novel proposed RNN model.

AB This paper investigates the sliding mode control problem for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy stochastic impulsive systems. Since considered T-S fuzzy systems contain stochastic impulses, a new continuous fuzzy integral sliding surface is designed so that its reachability is ensured for any a given time. Based on the designed fuzzy integral sliding surface, a fuzzy sliding mode controller is developed, which can guarantee the exponential stability of T-S fuzzy stochastic impulsive system. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, the exponential stability conditions of T-S fuzzy stochastic impulsive systems are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Consequently, a control design algorithm is formulated based on the established the exponential stability conditions. Finally, two simulation examples and comparisons are provided to check the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy SMC scheme.

AB Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), which consists of multiple linguistic terms and their probabilities, has been proposed to tackle qualitative information in informs of linguistic expressions. Since experts are inclined to compare alternatives in pairs, the probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), a matrix whose elements are PLTSs, has attracted wide attention since it was first introduced in 2016. Fruitful research achievements regarding PLPRs have been generated, especially in group decision making (GDM). This paper reviews 88 selected articles published from 2016 to June 4, 2023 regarding PLPRs, and presents a review of researches on theory and applications of PLPRs. First, we conduct a bibliometric study of these selected articles in terms of publication and citation trends, most productive countries/regions, categories of publications and keyword co-occurrence relationships. Next, the theory of PLPRs including definition, missing element deduction, consistency checking, prioritization, and decision-making analysis methods are recalled. We also review real-world applications of these publications and find that PLPRs have been mainly applied in four areas, including healthcare management, project evaluation, environment and energy management, and emergency management. In the end, we propose future research directions related to the probabilistic linguistic decision-making theory and provide insights for researchers and practitioners who have an interest in complex linguistic decision making.

AB This paper aims at the tracking control for a class of nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems with input quantization, asymmetric fuzzy dead zones and unknown control directions. First, a useful coordinate transformation is firstly given such that the problem caused by the unknown control coefficients is figured out, and then the researched system is transformed into an equivalent system. Second, with the combination of the nonlinear decomposition of an asymmetric hysteresis quantizer and a simplified asymmetric dead zone model obtained by adopting the integrated design algorithm, a feasible connection between system input and control signal is established. Then, the difficult control issue that results from the coexistence of the asymmetric hysteresis quantization and asymmetric fuzzy dead zone is overcome. Third, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. By introducing a smooth function, a novel adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed via backstepping technique. It is proved that the integrated fuzzy controller can make all the signals of the closed-loop system bounded and make the tracking error as small as possible. Finally, simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

AB Owing to the deep integration of intelligent control, big data and communication, networked Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control systems is widely studied and applied to the real-world scenarios. This paper studies the issue of resilient event-triggered dynamic output feedback controller design of networked Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks launched by adversaries. Considering the types of the attack limited by frequency and duration, a resilient event-triggered mechanism is established to resist the impact of DoS attacks and improve resource utilization efficiency, and two new switched fuzzy system models are constructed by integrating the underlying system and the event-based static and dynamic output feedback intelligent controllers. Then sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the switched systems are exponential stable and then the control gains are designed by using a novel iterative algorithm. Finally, two examples are employed to verify the effectiveness of the developed method.

ID ALGORITHM; FORMULATION
AB Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DMRI) reconstruction is a challenging theme in image processing. A variety of dimensionality reduction methods using vectorization have been proposed. However, most of them gave rise to a loss of spatial and temporal information. To deal with this problem, this article develops a DMRI reconstruction method in a nonlocal framework by integrating the nonlocal sparse tensor with low-rank tensor regularization. The sparsity constraint employs the Tucker decomposition tensor sparse representation, and the t-product-based tensor nuclear norm is used to set the low-rank constraint. Both constraints are handled in a nonlocal framework, which can take advantage of data redundancy in DMRI. Furthermore, the nonlocal sparse tensor representation we proposed constructs a tensor dictionary in the spatio-temporal dimension, making sparsity more efficient. Consequently, our method can better exploit the multi-dimensional coherence of DMRI data due to its sparsity and lowrankness and the fact that it uses a different tensor decomposition-based method. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been used for optimization. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to several conventional methods.

AB Emotion is usually caused by complex psychological and physiological changes triggered by external stimuli. It is considered one of the abilities to guide one's thinking and action. Emotion-level recognition realizes psychological perception and evaluation by collecting various data characteristics of individual behavior and physiological level, and reversely deriving complex physiological psychological mapping. Emotional Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are not easy to be hidden and forged, and using them for emotion-level recognition has high application value. However, EEG data are often collected in complex environments and scenes, and there are strong time and individual differences in EEG signals. This study proposes a cross-domain transferable discriminant dictionary based sparse representation (CTDDSR) approach for EEG emotion-level recognition. CTDDSR utilizes subspace projection strategy to find a suitable projection subspace. In this subspace, CTDDSR learns the shared dictionary to construct a strong connection between the source and target domains in the framework of dictionary based sparse representation. Different from the traditional projection matrices are completely domain-specific, our projection matrix for each domain is the combination of the domain-specific component and domain-invariable component. The former component is used to retain the individual domain information. By maximizing the cross-domain reconstruction error, the latter component is used to exploit the discriminant knowledge across domains in the shared latent subspace. In addition, to obtain the discriminant dictionary in the subspace, CTDDSR introduces linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to ensure the minimum of the intra-class reconstruction error and the maximum of the inter-class reconstruction error on sparse coding coefficients within each domain. Cross-domain EEG emotion-level recognition experiments are performed on the real EEG emotion dataset and verified that CTDDSR has excellent recognition performance.

ID CHATTER PREDICTION; IDENTIFICATION; SUPPRESSION
AB Accurate milling stability prediction is necessary for selecting chatter-free machining parameters to ensure the machining quality. With the development of machine learning techniques, data-driven methods have demonstrated powerful modelling capabilities for stability prediction. However, the significant performance of data-driven modelling usually requires a large labelled training dataset consisting of stable and unstable experimental data, which is expensive and time-consuming for metal-cutting scenarios. Therefore, how to design an experimental parameter set to build the experimental labelled dataset which is small but can provide sufficient support for data-driven stability prediction has been a critical problem and has received increasing attention. Existing research samples the experimental parameters by the grid or the boundary method, which inevitably brings lots of low-value data points for model training. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Guided High-Value (PGHV) data sampling method to reduce the required experiments for data-driven stability prediction. A novel value function is designed based on the physics information of milling dynamic stability to quantify the potential contribution of different experimental parameters. The optimal experimental parameter set can then be determined by maximising the dataset value. After that, the experimental labelled dataset can be constructed by performing cutting experiments under the sampled experimental parameters. Finally, the stability prediction model can be obtained by the data-driven modelling method with the experimental labelled dataset. Experimental verification shows that the proposed method can reduce the number of experiments by more than 60% compared to the existing sampling methods.

ID DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT
AB It is well known that many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) are difficultly to be balanced diversity and convergence in the search process because diversity and convergence contradict each other. The method of evaluating the diversity of the solution set can directly affect the final performances of the algorithms. In this article, a point crowding-degree (PC) strategy is proposed to evaluate the diversity of solutions. The proposed PC strategy not only considers the distance between any two points as large as possible, but also considers the gap between each dimension component as large as possible. Moreover, The PC only ponders the influence of surrounding neighbor points on the diversity of a point. A selection strategy is designed to balance convergence and diversity. Based on all, a point crowding-degree based evolutionary algorithm (PCEA) for many-objective optimization problems is proposed. The PCEA is compared experimentally with several state-of-the-art algorithms on the 57 many-objective benchmark functions and the experimental results show that the proposed PCEA algorithm has strong competitiveness and better overall performance. In addition, the proposed PC strategy is integrated into other advanced MaOPs methods. The results show that it is beneficial to improve the performance of other MaOEAs algorithms.

AB "On-the-fly" molecule enrichment by micro/nanomotors obviously improves heterogeneous catalysis, trace detection, and environmental monitoring, yet faces challenges of the trade-off between collection range and interaction time. Inspired by the versatile foraging process of predators, this work demonstrates that micromotors doing spontaneous multipattern motion with microvortex can greatly enhance "on-the-fly" enrichment, demonstrated by highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection. It leverages an axis-asymmetric bowl-shaped structure and the nonlinear Ag-AgCl reaction, realizing alternating low-velocity swinging forward and accelerated steering motions for prolonged interaction and large work area. Moreover, the bowl-shaped microstructure bestows a micro-vortex above the Ag side due to the competition of electric potential and pressure gradient, also extending interaction time during the acceleration. Consequently, it exhibits at least an order of magnitude larger enhancement of detection signals than the counterparts. This proof-of-concept study highlights the significance of motion mode and structure design in guiding flow field, offering substantial benefits for applications.
   Leveraging an axis-asymmetric bowl-shaped structure and Ag-AgCl nonlinear chemical reaction can produce a micromotor spontaneously doing switchable multipattern motion between swinging forward and accelerated steering with a microvortex. It demonstrates an enhanced "on-the-fly" molecule enrichment by an order of magnitude larger than the counterparts.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB In wearable robotics, soft actuation principles have been increasingly explored and tested due to their safety and comfort in human-robot interactions. Herein, a braided flat-tube artificial muscle (BFAM) is presented. BFAMs are fabricated by braiding cotton threads together with an inexpensive lay-flat tube (LFT) in a specific conform-to-LFT weaving method. They generate uniaxial contractions when powered by compressed fluids. The basic structure and working mechanism of the proposed BFAM are explained, and a quasistatic model is also developed. A comparison with other fluidic driven soft actuators is made and tabulated. Based on experimental studies, the proposed BFAM can contract close to 30% and yield force outputs more than 150 times their weight at an air pressure of 0.12 MPa. BFAM can be braided with multiple layers of flat tube without large increase of size. Experimental studies have shown that more layers of flat tube give a larger strain and output force up to four layers, beyond which layer increase does not yield visible improvement in strain and output force. Finally, potential applications of BFAM to arm joint actuations are illustrated to show its easy fitting to wearable robotics.
   Herein, a novel textile-like artificial muscle is proposed by braiding cotton threads together with an inexpensive lay-flat tube (LFT) in a specific conform-to-LFT weaving method. This braided flat-tube artificial muscle has broad application prospects and demonstrates remarkable advantages in applications with human-robot interactions.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Based on the observation that live fish caudal fins exhibit softness, flexibility, and active deformation, which are essential for generating thrust, stability, and maneuverability, herein, a comprehensive study on a novel type of bionic robotic fish with an actively deformable caudal fin is presented. The article first presents the design of the robot. Next, the quasisteady model theory is used to establish the hydrodynamic force for modeling the deformable caudal fin. Furthermore, three deformation modes are studied and compared: the conventional nondeformable mode, the sine-based mode, and the instantaneous mode. Finally, a series of extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate various performance metrics of this innovative untethered biomimetic robotic fish, including thrust, swimming speed, yaw stability, turning radius, and turning rate. The results demonstrate that the introduction of active deformation of the caudal fin significantly enhances the swimming performance in the aforementioned indices when compared to the conventional nondeformable mode. Notably, the instantaneous mode exhibits best performance in terms of thrust, swimming speed, turning radius, and turning rate, while the sine-based mode demonstrates the best yaw stability. Consequently, this research contributes to the advancement of robotic fish design and the development of underwater biomimetic robots.
   Based on the observation that live fish caudal fins exhibit active deformation, which is essential for generating thrust, stability, and maneuverability, this article presents a comprehensive study on a novel type of bionic robotic fish with an actively deformable caudal fin.

AB Spatial manipulation of liquid droplets holds great significance in various areas from laboratory research to everyday life. Unfortunately, current manipulators are limited to lower responsivity and unreliable durability together with swinging-dependent manner. Herein, an ultrarobust, sensitive, and swinging-independent droplet-spatial manipulator is reported, namely, magnetically actuated shape-morphing microshutters (MASM) enabled by laser printing and soft transfer technique. Leveraging the loading/discharging of a remote magnet, the MASM can be reversibly switched between a bending mode and an erect mode within 1 s, thereby modulating the three-phase contact line (TCL). The underlying hydrodynamics is that B-mode MASM renders a longer TCL and an exaggerated adhesion force (Fa), thereby pinning the surface droplets under the assistance of a magnetic field. Once the magnetic trigger is removed, the bent shutters reverse back to the E-mode so as to grant a shorter TCL and smaller Fa. Based on this phenomenon, the droplet's capture/release can be readily realized in response to magnetic stimuli. Last but not least, by taking advantage of an optimized MASM, pattern-free configuration and droplets on-demand marriage and targeted chemical reaction together with programmable circuit remedy are deployed. This work provides impetus for researchers in constructing intelligent droplet manipulation systems for multidisciplinary areas.
   Spatial manipulation of droplets unfolds great significance in various areas from laboratory research to everyday life.

AB Many real-world data mining applications involve using imbalanced datasets to obtain predictive models. Imbalanced data can hinder the model performance of learning algorithms in rare cases. Although there are many well-researched classification task solutions, most of them cannot be directly applied to regression task. One of the challenges in imbalanced regression is to find a suitable evaluation and optimization standard that can improve the predictive ability of the model without severe model bias. Based on the importance of rare cases, this study proposes a new evaluation metric called adapted squared error relevance (ASER) by defining new relevance function and weighting functions. This metric weights data points by defining the importance of rare cases and assigns different weights to losses of the same size at different rare cases, thus enabling the model selected by this evaluation metric to better predict rare cases. ASER is compared with SER on 32 real datasets and 9 simulated datasets to verify the predictive performance of the selected model at rare cases. The experimental results show that the new evaluation metric ASER can obtain a high prediction performance at rare cases, while also not losing too much prediction accuracy in common cases.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust election simulation model and independently developed election anomaly detection algorithm that demonstrates the simulation's utility. The simulation generates artificial elections with similar properties and trends as elections from the real world, while giving users control and knowledge over all the important components of the elections. We generate a clean election results dataset without fraud as well as datasets with varying degrees of fraud. We then measure how well the algorithm is able to successfully detect the level of fraud present. The algorithm determines how similar actual election results are as compared to the predicted results from polling and a regression model of other regions that have similar demographics. We use k-means to partition electoral regions into clusters such that demographic homogeneity is maximized among clusters. We then use a novelty detection algorithm implemented as a one-class support vector machine where the clean data is provided in the form of polling predictions and regression predictions. The regression predictions are built from the actual data in such a way that the data supervises itself. We show both the effectiveness of the simulation technique and the machine learning model in its success in identifying fraudulent regions.

AB This work provides a complete framework for the simulation, co-optimization, and sim-to-real transfer of the design and control of soft legged robots. Soft robots have "mechanical intelligence": the ability to passively exhibit behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to program. Exploiting this capacity requires consideration of the coupling between design and control. Co-optimization provides a way to reason over this coupling. Yet, it is difficult to achieve simulations that are both sufficiently accurate to allow for sim-to-real transfer and fast enough for contemporary co-optimization algorithms. We describe a modularized model order reduction algorithm that improves simulation efficiency, while preserving the accuracy required to learn effective soft robot design and control. We propose a reinforcement learning-based co-optimization framework that identifies several soft crawling robots that outperform an expert baseline with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. We study generalization of the framework to new terrains, and the efficacy of domain randomization as a means to improve sim-to-real transfer.

AB The rapid development of the Internet has led to a shift in how people communicate, with social media becoming an essential vehicle for communication and information exchange. In this context, social media influencers have emerged. With expertise in a particular field and strong influence, they can change customers' attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors. Although social media influencers have been widely studied in the marketing field, most scholars at this stage mainly study the change in customers' attitudes and purchasing behaviors towards brands, without considering the contingency of consumers' participation in influencer marketing activities in the context of social media. Plus, researchers did not pay sufficient attention to customers' impulsive purchasing behaviors. Thus, this article investigated the factors influencing customers' impulsive buying behavior in social media influencer marketing situations. This study built an elaboration likelihood model (i.e., ELM) to explore the factors and mediating variables contributing to customers' impulsive buying behavior. Questionnaires were used to explore the factors influencing customers' impulsive buying behavior in a social media influencer marketing context. Respondents' attitudes on each dimension were measured using well-established scales from existing research, and the data were processed to draw conclusions. Findings showed that in the influencer marketing context, consumers' perceived social value and influencer expertise would not directly impact their impulsive buying behavior. Functional and emotional values could lead to impulse buying behavior, while social values would not lead to customer inspiration. Moreover, authenticity and influence both contributed to impulsive buying behaviors. The findings might have important implications for influencer marketing and further studies on impulsive buying. Companies should select authentic and influential influencers; what's more, the influencers should be sincere and enhance their influence to gain consumers' trust.

AB With the change and complexity of the tourism market environment, the financial risks faced by tourism enterprises are increasingly diversified. Effectively evaluating and controlling these financial risks has become the key to the development of tourism enterprises. Therefore, this study builds an accurate and real-time enterprise financial risk assessment and control model with the help of genetic algorithm. The results show that compared with other models, the maximum error value of the research model is only 0.12, and the maximum mean square error is only 0.09. The high reliability of the model is verified by simulating the data of selected tourism enterprises. After increasing the number of samples, the accuracy of the model continues to improve, and the predicted financial indicators are more in line with the actual situation. The model achieves the best results in average fitness, and the required error value is reached within 10 iterations. In the goodness of fit comparison, the goodness of fit of the training set, the test set and the verification set of the model are all over 0.7. In the empirical analysis, the ACC of the research model reached 97.4%, the accuracy rate reached 97.1%, the F1 index of the research reached 98.6%, and the other three research models were all lower than 98%. The above shows that the research model has significant advantages and can effectively evaluate and control the financial risk of tourism enterprises.

AB This paper presents a novel extension of multi-task Gaussian Cox processes for modeling multiple heterogeneous correlated tasks jointly, e.g., classification and regression, via multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP). A MOGP prior over the parameters of the dedicated likelihoods for classification, regression and point process tasks can facilitate sharing of information between heterogeneous tasks, while allowing for nonparametric parameter estimation. To circumvent the non-conjugate Bayesian inference in the MOGP modulated heterogeneous multi-task framework, we employ the data augmentation technique and derive a mean-field approximation to realize closed-form iterative updates for estimating model parameters. We demonstrate the performance and inference on both 1D synthetic data as well as 2D urban data of Vancouver.

TI Improved conversational recommender system based on dialog context

DE Retrieval and generation; Dialog recommender system; Time-series

AB Conversational recommender system (CRS) needs to be seamlessly integrated between the two modules of recommendation and dialog, aiming to recommend high-quality items to users through multiple rounds of interactive dialogs. Items can typically refer to goods, movies, news, etc. Through this form of interactive dialog, users can express their preferences in real time, and the system can fully understand the user's thoughts and recommend corresponding items. Although mainstream dialog recommendation systems have improved the performance to some extent, there are still some key issues, such as insufficient consideration of the entity's order in the dialog, the different contributions of items in the dialog history, and the low diversity of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an improved dialog context model based on time-series features. Firstly, we augment the semantic representation of words and items using two external knowledge graphs and align the semantic space using mutual information maximization techniques. Secondly, we add a retrieval model to the dialog recommendation system to provide auxiliary information for generating replies. We then utilize a deep timing network to serialize the dialog content and more accurately learn the feature relationship between users and items for recommendation. In this paper, the dialog recommendation system is divided into two components, and different evaluation indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the dialog component and the recommendation component. Experimental results on widely used benchmarks show that the proposed method is effective.

AB Quality function deployment (QFD) method allows reviewing of customer requirements (CRs) and design requirements (DRs) simultaneously in order to handle the correlations and relationships of CRs and DRs in calculations. It has been often combined with fuzzy numbers, because it provides to gather the judgments of experts in vagueness environment more correctly and easily. This paper suggests employing q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (q-ROFN) for improving the fuzzy QFD approach. The proposed q-ROFN based QFD method uses q-ROFN to adjust the importance degrees of CRs based the relationships between CRs and DRs with the help of the correlations and relationships of CRs and DRs. q-ROFN presents more information than numbers such as intuitionistic fuzzy number and Pythagorean fuzzy number about the correlations and relationships of CRs and DRs. Furthermore, this work proposes integrating Fine-Kinney method and QFD method to cope with limitations of Fine-Kinney method. VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOm-promisno Resenje) approach based on q-ROFN is also used to rank DRs. The proposed integrated method provides a novel decision support model for the natural gas pipeline project (NGPP) risk assessment. There is no study about the integration of Fine-Kinney, q-ROFN-based QFD, VIKOR methods. The most significant DR and the second most important DR for NGPP risk assessment are electrical sparks and coating type factor, respectively. The results of this model present a road map to the managers of NGPP for an occupational health and safety policy by ordering the failure modes.

AB In recent years, the focus on modernization and advanced communication technologies has shifted to smart cities, where society and families, particularly, are engaged with various means of entertainment, e.g., cinema. In the context of cinema, movies have a pivotal role, where cultural heritage, along with urban and rural images, have gradually been marginalized from the commercial field to an elite position. The real picture of rural life has been narrowed down to explore the local cultural heritage. In China, rural communities have existed for centuries, where the rural images of farmers depict their standard of living, civilization and the way in which the ecological environment is protected. This paper studies the factors relevant to the transmission of rural images for a better understanding of cultural heritage conducive to rural culture's inheritance and development. This paper first constructs water yield and soil conservation models for rural eco-environmental protection. Next, the paper analyzes the main factors that influence the communication of rural images in these models, followed by an analysis of the communication mode used by each factor. Moreover, the proposed study disseminates rural images by creating an imaging action framework. Wuzhen, a famous historic town in China, is taken as a case study for this paper. The study analyzed the representation of Wuzhen's rural pictures over time, with 77% of the content dominated by bridges and rivers. The highest number of shootings, involving 82 households, was recorded in 2018. Therefore, 2019 showed a slight decline in shootings, with 67 households involved, indicating potential fluctuations in interest or external factors affecting video production that year. However, in 2019, bridges and rivers still constituted 75% of the content, underscoring their enduring significance in portraying the rural beauty of Wuzhen. These findings highlight the appeal and importance of these natural features in the region's visual narrative.

AB Currently, electromyography (EMG)-driven lower limb control can be divided into computational intrinsic control and interactive extrinsic control based on the participation of neural information in the controllers. However, the former method lacks detailed measurements of the expected motion, whereas the latter is prone to errors in diverse movement situations. Based on this problem, a multi-intent prediction scheme is proposed that analyzes both rhythmic locomotion and volitional movement intent for AI-based intrinsic and extrinsic hybrid control (AIEC). A 1D residual shrinkage convolutional network is designed to extract EMG features. The motion state is continuously predicted with an accuracy of 91.66% and the angle completion is also estimated with R2$R<^>{2}$ of 0.9540 and 0.9456 for left and right knee angles, respectively. Additionally, the comparison test further indicates that the motion state classification is significantly improved in the multitask analysis compared with the single-task approach. This work demonstrates and verifies a novel method in EMG studies that multi-intent recognition not only compensates for the lack of information in the analysis of single rhythmic or volitional movement, but also enhances the comprehensive performance and makes AIEC feasible, which optimizes the current EMG-driven control for ampler intent collection and more practical robotic control.
   Herein, both rhythmic locomotion and volitional movement intention have been simultaneously analyzed from electromyography (EMG) signals. Knee angles and seven motion states during dynamic locomotion are continuously recognized. And it is discovered that the multitask learning not only compensates for the lack of information in the control system, but also improves the single-task performance in EMG study.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Because of the number of different architectures, numerous settings of their hyper-parameters and disparity among their sizes, it is difficult to equitably compare various deep neural network (DNN) architectures for sentence classification. Evolutionary algorithms are emerging as a popular method for the automatic selection of architectures and hyperparameters for DNNs whose generalisation performance is heavily impacted by such settings. Most of the work in this area is done in the image domain, leaving text analysis, another prominent application domain of deep learning, largely absent. Besides, literature presents conflicting claims regarding the superiority of one DNN architecture over others in the context of sentence classification. To address this issue, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimising the architectural and hyperparameter settings in different DNN types for sentence classification. To enable the representation of the wide variety of architectures and hyperparameters utilised in DNNs, we employed a generalised and flexible encoding scheme in our GA. Our study involves optimising two convolutional and three recurrent architectures to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation of their performance. Furthermore, we explore the effects of using F1 score versus accuracy as a performance metric during evolutionary optimisation of those architectures. Our results, using ten datasets, show that, in general, the architectures and hyperparameters evolved using the F1 score tended to outperform those evolved using accuracy and in the case of CNN and BiLSTM the results were significant in statistical measures. Of the five architectures considered, the GA-evolved gated recurrent unit (GRU) performed the strongest overall, achieving good generalisation performance while using relatively few trainable parameters, establishing GRU as the preferred architecture for the sentence classification task. The optimised architectures exhibited comparable performance with the state-of-the-art, given the large difference in trainable parameters.

AB Deep-sea image is of great significance for exploring seabed resources. However, the information of a single image is limited. Besides, deep-sea image with low contrast and colour distortion further restricts useful feature extraction. To address the issues above, this paper presents a multi-channel fusion and accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE) feature detection algorithm for deep-sea image stitching. First, the authors restore deep-sea image in LAB colour space and RGB colour space, respectively; in LAB space, the authors use homomorphic filtering in L colour channel, and in RGB space, the authors adopt multi-scale Retinex with chromaticity preservation algorithm to adjust the colour information. Then, the authors blend two pre-processed images with dark channel prior weighted coefficient. After that, the authors detect feature points with the AKAZE algorithm and obtain feature descriptors with Boosted Efficient Binary Local Image Descriptor. Finally, the authors match the feature points and warp deep-sea images to obtain the stitched image. Experimental results demonstrate that the authors' method generates high-quality stitched image with minimized seam. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method has better quantitative evaluation, visual stitching results, and robustness.
   A multi-channel image fusion algorithm based on homomorphic filtering and MSRCP is proposed. An accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE) with BEBLID algorithm is used to stitch deep-sea image.image

AB Every type of machine translation system (i.e. neural, statistical, rule-based machine translation system) is equal important to build a sophistical hybrid machine translation system. Keeping this fact in my mind, I concentrate to improve statistical machine translation system with more natural way. In this paper, I try to preserve sentiment after translation to improve the overall accuracy of the machine translation system. So, I introduced senti-model here. A senti-model (sentiment model), translation model, language model, and distortion model are incorporated on the top of the beam search algorithm for decoding. At first, sentiment information is learned and modeled with translation probability by using this algorithm. Thereafter, I decode the source sentences-based on the contextual information. Overall procedure of translation modeling with a sentiment, parameter estimation for it, and senti-translation decoding (decoding with the sentiment model) are presented with empirical evidence. Experiments on a benchmark English-Hindi dataset shows that the proposed model is capable to improve the accuracy (in terms of 4.66 BLEU points, 4.09 LeBleu points, 4.67 NIST points, 5.71 RIBES points) significantly and preserves sentiment 7.79% more than the state-of-the-art technique.

AB In order to optimize the integration of English multimedia resources and achieve the goal of sharing English teaching resources in education, this article reconstructs the traditional college English curriculum system. It divides professional English into learning modules according to different majors integrating public health teaching resources. How optimize the integration of English multimedia resources and achieving the goal of sharing English teaching resources (ETR) is the main direction of English teaching reform during the current COVID-19 pandemic. An English multimedia teaching resource-sharing platform is designed to extract feature items from multimedia teaching resources using the ID3 information gain method and construct a decision tree for resource push. In resource sharing, a structured peer-to-peer network is used to manage nodes, query location and share multimedia teaching resources. The optimal gateway node is selected by calculating the distance between each gateway node and the fixed node. Finally, a collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm recommends Multimedia ETR to different users. The simulation results show that the platform can improve the sharing speed and utilization rate of teaching resources, with maximum throughput reaching 12 Mb/s and achieve accurate recommendations of ETR.

AB This study presents the mutation-crossover slime mold algorithm (MCSMA) to balance the time, cost, quality, and work continuity in a particular construction project. The slime mold algorithm is combined with the mutation-crossover method to modify the operating mechanism and increase the ability of finding optimal solutions in the exploration and exploitation space during the optimization process. The optimal exchange problem considers all the logical aspects of occurring activities and the obvious reasoning applied to choose a compromise solution in the project implementation. The MCSMA is compared with five well-known algorithms (i.e., OMOSOS, MOABC, MODE, MOPSO, and NSGA-II) to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed model. According to the analysis results, the MCSMA generates a diversification measure for both case studies with 0.501 and 0.485 C-Metric, 0.785 and 0.923 Spread, and 0.843 and 0.806 Hyper-volume. The algorithmic model represents development, improvement, and diversification in the problem of achieving model convergence and wide distribution and gives a better uniformity of optimal solutions compared to the other algorithms.

AB The recovery of morphologically accurate anatomical images from deformed ones is challenging in ultrasound (US) image acquisition, but crucial to accurate and consistent diagnosis, particularly in the emerging field of computer-assisted diagnosis. This article presents a novel physics-aware deformation correction approach based on a coarse-to-fine, multi-scale deep neural network (DefCor-Net). To achieve pixel-wise performance, DefCor-Net incorporates biomedical knowledge by estimating pixel-wise stiffness online using a U-shaped feature extractor. The deformation field is then computed using polynomial regression by integrating the measured force applied by the US probe. Based on real-time estimation of pixel-by-pixel tissue properties, the learning-based approach enables the potential for anatomy-aware deformation correction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DefCor-Net, images recorded at multiple locations on forearms and upper arms of six volunteers are used to train and validate DefCor-Net. The results demonstrate that DefCor-Net can significantly improve the accuracy of deformation correction to recover the original geometry (Dice Coefficient: from 14.3 +/- 20.9 to 82.6 +/- 12.1 when the force is 6 N).

ID SEGMENTATION; NETWORK
AB Medical image segmentation methods using the attention mechanism have achieved great results. However, these attention mechanisms primarily focus on the evaluation of explicit response values, ignoring the important information provided by the implicit energy, i.e., the grayscale change frequency contained in the data. The deficiency in the attention mechanism mentioned above limits its ability to aggregate valid features in medical image segmentation tasks. We propose an efficient network for medical image segmentation, named TransMIS. This network innovatively designs an implicit attention mechanism to interoperate with the explicit attention mechanism and fuses multi-level features with long-range and local dependencies to construct a robust feature representation, effectively improving its segmentation performance. Specifically, TransMIS introduces two new components: (1) A MultiScale Compression Self-Attention Mechanism (MSCS) that uses the sparse representation to replace complex feature tensors for matrix multiplication, which can effectively enhance feature representation while reducing the amount of computation. (2) An Explicit-Implicit Channel Mixer Module (CMM) that combines implicit energy quantification and explicit response value evaluation methods, which can bridge the discrepancies between different semantic information and fuse multi-level features effectively. With extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, it shows that TransMIS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for medical image segmentation. We also conduct rigorous ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed components.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural topology optimization is a compute-intensive process due to several iterations of simulations required to evaluate the performance of the component during optimization. Deep learning (DL) based approaches can address this challenge, but these methods were demonstrated mainly using 2D shapes and, at best, in low-resolution 3D geometries (typically 32(3)). Further, due to non-manufacturable geometric features, the predicted optimal geometries from DL may not be manufacturable, even using additive manufacturing. In this paper, we develop a DL framework using a multigrid convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate high-resolution topology-optimized 3D geometries with additional checks on the manufacturability of the predicted shapes. Our framework predicts the final optimal topology using the initial strain energy (objective function of structural topology optimization) and target volume fraction (material fraction to be preserved after optimization) as input. We train the network using a multigrid approach, which enables topology optimization at 1283 resolution, which was previously computationally challenging. We first train the multigrid CNN at a lower resolution and then transfer the learned network to continue training at higher resolutions. We use a distributed deep learning framework on a GPU supercomputing cluster to further speed up the training time. Distributed DL significantly speeds up the training time by more than 4x while achieving similar model performance. Finally, we check the optimal geometries for manufacturability using fused deposition modeling (FDM)-specific manufacturability constraints. The large training dataset (>60,000 high-resolution topology optimization examples) will be released with the paper to enable further research on this topic.

AB Typically, the parameters of a practical problem are considered to be deterministic. Nevertheless, there may be possibility that these parameters are incomplete owing to observational or experimental errors. Fuzzy sets are capable of handling such problems. In addition, the majority of studies on fuzzy fractional heat equations have employed two spatial variables and fuzzy sets with deterministic membership. In some instances, however, there may be more than two spatial variables, and the membership grade associated with an uncertain parameter may also contain imprecise information. Consequently, dealing with such a situation may be fascinating. In this regard, the main objective of this research is to develop alternative methods for solving the n thorn 1-dimensional fractional order heat equation with an external source term in an uncertain environment. The problem is addressed by using the Elzaki transformed homotopy perturbation method and the fractional reduced differential transformation method in the fuzzy environment. Caputo fuzzy fractional derivatives are considered here. In this study, triangular fuzzy numbers and Gaussian fuzzy numbers are utilised to handle type-1 fuzzy uncertainty, whereas triangularly perfect quasi type-2 fuzzy numbers and newly introduced Gaussian-triangular type-2 fuzzy numbers are used to handle type-2 fuzzy uncertainty. Numerical examples with graphical representations are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the approaches. Convergence plots are also provided.

AB We introduce a large-scale neurocomputational model of spatial cognition called 'Spacecog', which integrates recent findings from mechanistic models of visual and spatial perception. As a highlevel cognitive ability, spatial cognition requires the processing of behaviourally relevant features in complex environments and, importantly, the updating of this information during processes of eye and body movement. The Spacecog model achieves this by interfacing spatial memory and imagery with mechanisms of object localisation, saccade execution, and attention through coordinate transformations in parietal areas of the brain. We evaluate the model in a realistic virtual environment where our neurocognitive model steers an agent to perform complex visuospatial tasks. Our modelling approach opens up new possibilities in the assessment of neuropsychological data and human spatial cognition.

DE Generative adversarial networks (GANs); object detection; unsupervised
   knowledge distillation (KD)
AB Object detection techniques have been widely studied, utilized in various works, and have exhibited robust performance on images with sufficient luminance. However, these approaches typically struggle to extract valuable features from low-luminance images, which often exhibit blurriness and dim appearence, leading to detection failures. To overcome this issue, we introduce an innovative unsupervised feature domain knowledge distillation (KD) framework. The proposed framework enhances the generalization capability of neural networks across both low-and high-luminance domains without incurring additional computational costs during testing. This improvement is made possible through the integration of generative adversarial networks and our proposed unsupervised KD process. Furthermore, we introduce a region-based multiscale discriminator designed to discern feature domain discrepancies at the object level rather than from the global context. This bolsters the joint learning process of object detection and feature domain distillation tasks. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments shown that the proposed method, empowered by the region-based multiscale discriminator and the unsupervised feature domain distillation process, can effectively extract beneficial features from low-luminance images, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches in both low-and sufficient-luminance domains.

DE Wavelets; Denoising; Signal processing; Multichannel; Time series;

AB As monitoring multiple signals becomes more cost-effective, combining them through a data fusion-aware denoising method can produce a more robust estimation of the underlying process. Here, we present a method based on the Haar wavelet transform that trades off resolution against accuracy based on statistical significance. By taking advantage of correlations between channels, it offers a superior performance compared to denoising each channel separately. It outperforms standard wavelet methods when the magnitude of interest in the data-fusion process involves a non-linear transformation or reduction of a multichannel signal. We demonstrate its efficacy by benchmarking our method against standard wavelet thresholding for synthetic single and multichannel time series, and a multichannel two-dimensional image. The method has a simple interpretation as an adaptive binning of the signal, and neither requires training data nor specialized hardware to run fast. In addition, a reference Python implementation is available on GitHub and PyPI, making it simple to integrate into any analysis pipeline.

TI 3D detection transformer: Set prediction of objects using point clouds

DT Article
DE Deep learning; 3D object detection; Point clouds; Transformers;
   Single-stage detector
AB Object detection in 3D scenes rely on two main methods: detection based on proposals (two-stage detectors) or detections based on anchors (single-stage detectors), similar to approaches for object detection in 2D. In this paper, we propose the 3DeTR framework that produces 3D detections without the use of anchors or proposals, allowing training of the entire neural network in an end-to-end manner. Raw point cloud scenes are augmented and input into distance-and-reflectiveness-based feature extractor to produce representative points. Then, a transformer encoder-decoder module learns the local object relations and global context to generate parallel detections, which are then passed to a set-based loss function to map predictions to the set of ground truth labels uniquely. The model's architecture produces 3D detections by regressing directly with the set of ground truths without the need for anchors or proposals, which are bottlenecks for object detection performances. We tested the framework on the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite 3D object detection dataset, achieving results on par with the state-of-the-art: 80.37 AP on Cars (Moderate) class and 47.92 AP on Pedestrians (Moderate) class.

   Self-supervised learning
AB In recent years, self-supervised autoencoders have developed into a powerful representation learning framework in computer vision and natural language processing. However, their application to graph data has resulted in limited performance due to the non-Euclidean and complex structure of graphs compared to images or text, as well as the limitations of conventional autoencoder architectures. In this paper, we investigate factors impacting the performance of autoencoders on graph data and propose a novel autoencoder model for graph representation learning. Our model incorporates a hierarchical adaptive masking mechanism to incrementally increase the difficulty of training to mimic the process of human cognitive learning and a trainable corruption scheme to enhance the robustness of learned representations. Through extensive experimentation on ten benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art graph representation learning models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Tampering localization
AB As an emerging digital product, artificial intelligence models face the risk of being modified. Malicious tampering will severely damage model functions, which is different from normal modifications. In addition, tampering localization for targeted repair can effectively reduce the cost. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve model content authentication and locate the tampering location. We proposed a novel semi-fragile neural network water-marking method in this paper to address these issues. Specifically, with the precondition of maintaining model performance, we proposed a method that generates a set of semi-fragile samples for a model to achieve the content authentication and tampering localization. The experiment results show that the content authentication of the model can be achieved by analyzing the output results of the model for the semi-fragile samples. When the model is processed normally, the output results are consistent with the expected label, while when the model is maliciously tampered with, the model produces unstable output. Furthermore, the tamper localization of the model can be further achieved through the information hidden in the semi-fragile samples, resulting in an average accuracy of more than 99.42%. In addition, our method is also effective for other deep neural networks.

AB IntroductionMyoelectric control of prostheses is a long-established technique, using surface electromyography (sEMG) to detect user intention and perform subsequent mechanical actions. Most machine learning models utilized in control systems are trained using isolated movements that do not reflect the natural movements occurring during daily activities. Moreover, movements are often affected by arm postures, the duration of activities, and personal habits. It is crucial to have a control system for multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) prosthetic arms that is trained using sEMG data collected from activities of daily living (ADL) tasks.MethodThis work focuses on two major functional wrist movements: pronation-supination and dart-throwing movement (DTM), and introduces a new wrist control system that directly maps sEMG signals to the joint velocities of the multi-DoF wrist. Additionally, a specific training strategy (Quick training) is proposed that enables the controller to be applied to new subjects and handle situations where sensors may displace during daily living, muscles can become fatigued, or sensors can become contaminated (e.g., due to sweat). The prosthetic wrist controller is designed based on data from 24 participants and its performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson Correlation.ResultThe results are found to depend on the characteristics of the tasks. For example, tasks with dart-throwing motion show smaller RSME values (Hammer: 6.68 deg/s and Cup: 7.92 deg/s) compared to tasks with pronation-supination (Bulb: 43.98 deg/s and Screw: 53.64 deg/s). The proposed control technique utilizing Quick training demonstrates a decrease in the average root mean square error (RMSE) value by 35% and an increase in the average Pearson correlation value by 40% across all four ADL tasks.

AB Fluid dynamics of water flow through porous metallic media is significant for cooling and heating applications. The prediction of the velocity of fluid flowing inside the porous media could provide useful data for pressure drop calculations. This prediction is usually performed by a mathematical modeling approach like computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational method is a powerful means of precision calculation, although it could take more time and expenditure for more complex geometries or more complex fluid flow regimes. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms could learn and map CFD data under several conditions. AI algorithms could continue the prediction of physical data, saving computing time and performance. The present study focuses on CFD modeling of water flow inside a pipe filled with copper porous media. For the first time, the fuzzy bee algorithm (BAFIS) maps the generated CFD data to inlet velocities of 0.5, 0.7, 1.1, and 1.3 m/s. The BAFIS intelligence assessment for accurate convective flow prediction in porous media is not available in the literature. Additionally, the reliability of this method for missing CFD data prediction has not been considered yet. The results showed that the maximum intelligence (regression=0.97) is for a bee number of 140. Using the most intelligent BAFIS, the outlet velocity can be predicted by the artificial intelligence method for further nodes and inlet velocities without CFD modeling. BAFIS could precisely predict the outlet velocity for missing data with an inlet velocity of 0.91 m/s based on previously mapped data. A comparison was made between BAFIS and the fuzzy neural network (ANFIS) for CFD data predictions. The mean-square error and the root-mean-square error of ANFIS were slightly more than BAFIS (i.e., 0.1% and 3%, respectively).

AB In leather images, precise pore segmentation is a necessary medium for accurate species prediction. However, due to foreground color, texture, size, and boundary variability, traditional methods encounter false segmen-tation. This paper proposes a deep learning-based novel auto-pore segmentation network (ApSnet). It aims to automatically segment the species-definite pores from novel digital microscopic leather image data. The ApSnet learns the pore regions from raw and the corresponding ground-truth images. The images undergo patch-based image augmentation to fasten the learning process. The depth and the concatenations of the existing Unet are reduced to design the simple and shallow ApSnet. The weighted average loss function strengthens the image understanding to segment the accurate pore pixels. The experimental analysis affirms the superior performance of the proposed ApSnet against Unet, Unet++, and I-Unet. The study also validates ApSnet with KDSB18 and KVasir-SEG datasets for medical image segmentation. It also tests the robustness of ApSnet on the leather images with fuzzy textures. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model learns and classifies the features from the ApSnet segmented images with 97.4% accuracy. Thus, the analysis proves that precise pore segmentation is indispensable in interpreting species-distinct pore features. Therefore, the present work develops a human- computer interactive platform for accurate leather species prediction by designing a computationally efficient ApSnet-based segmentation model.

TI DeformSg2im: Scene graph based multi-instance image generation with a

   synthesis; Sequential modeling; Geometric deformation
AB Recently, scene graph based image generation has emerged to be an important research direction for advanced multi-instance generation tasks. Scene layout generation, the phase that produces the instance-wise visual representations and maintains the spatial relationships among all instances, is vital in translating a scene graph to an image. However, the scene layouts generated by existing methods are too coarse and semantically inconsistent with the given scene graph, which results in quality degradation of the generated images. Motivated by this, we propose a novel scene graph based image generation model called DeformSg2im, which aims to generate visually appealing and semantically faithful images according to the given scene graphs. Our method addresses the aforementioned problems from two aspects. In one aspect, we present an attention-based instance embedding estimator to refine the shape information for each instance. By introducing attention maps to the estimation of instance embeddings, our method is able to generate more plausible instances with sharp edges on the images. In the other aspect, a spatial warping network (SWN) is proposed to adaptively capture the spatial dependencies among instances. With sequential modeling and geometric deformations, the SWN is capable of generating the scene layout conforming to the given scene graph. Extensive experiments show that our model generates images with high visual quality and achieves competitive quantitative results compared to existing works. Ablation studies on the proposed modules are also conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Graph representation learning faces challenges in node classification tasks due to the intricate interplay between node categories, topological structure, significant characteristics, node attributes, and label information. How-ever, prevailing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) exhibit inefficiencies in information propagation and need more robustness when dealing with missing node attributes. To surmount these issues, attribute-based dynamic wandering and attribute enhancement methods are proposed. First, the Node Attribute Random Wandering (NARW) method is proposed to obtain the node sequences. The NARW method fully considers the node-to-node attribute information to determine the wandering direction of the sequences. Subsequently, the node attribute enhanced graph encoder model (AEGraph) is proposed, which aims to improve the node classification perfor-mance by combining the graph structure and node attribute information during the information propagation process. Each iteration process includes node label information aggregation and node label information update. Finally, to fully consider the local and global information of the graph, this paper reduces the noise generated by information propagation during the iteration process. The model proposed in this paper shows promising results with a low labeling rate. Experimental results show that the method achieves better results and significant improvements on different datasets.

ID THEORETIC APPROACH
AB The existing cyber deception decision-making model based on game theory primarily focuses on the selection of spatial strategies, which ignores the optimal defense timing and can affect the execution of a defense strategy. Consequently, this paper presents a method for selecting deception strategies based on a multi-stage Flipit game. Firstly, based on the analysis of cyber deception attack and defense, we propose a concept of moving deception attack surface and analyze the characteristics of deception attack and defense interaction behaviors based on the Flipit game model. The Flipit game model is then utilized to create a single-stage deception spatial-temporal decision-making model. Additionally, we introduce the discount factor and transition probability based on a single-stage game model and construct a multi-stage cyber deception model. We provide the utility function of the multi-stage game model, and design a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to compute the defender's optimal spatial-temporal strategies. Finally, we utilize an application example to validate the effectiveness of the model and the advantages of the proposed algorithm in generating the multi-stage cyber deception strategy.

TI IPCADP-Equalizer: An Improved Multibalance Privacy Preservation Scheme
   against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Although there are some protection mechanisms in federated learning, its training process is still vulnerable to some powerful attacks, such as invisible backdoor attacks. Existing research work focuses more on how to prevent attacks in distributed training scenarios and improve the security of the FL training process, but it lacks consideration of utility and robustness, especially when the learning model of FL suffers from stealth backdoor attacks. This paper proposes an improved FL defense scheme IPCADP based on user-level differential privacy and variational autoencoders technology. The scheme can control and protect the privacy attribute of the image and can also eliminate the triggers that exist in the poisoned image. The experimental results show that compared with some existing defense schemes, IPCADP can defend against invisible backdoor attacks and improve the classification accuracy of the main task, while mitigating the impact of attacks on model robustness and stability. To a certain extent, the balance and unity of security, utility, and robustness are realized.

AB The aim of this research is to use continuous time neural networks for solving the sparse portfolio problem, where the objective function includes a non-differentiable e1-norm regularization term. To address the non differentiable issue, we introduce two novel continuous time neural models that are based on the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN) framework. The proposed neural models have the ability to control the number of the assets in the resulting portfolio and adjust the weighting between risk and return. The first model, called LPNN-Approximation, handles the non-differentiable e1-norm term by utilizing a differentiable approximation. The second model merges the locally competitive algorithm (LCA) concept with the LPNN framework to address the non-differentiable term. It is called LPNN-LCA. For the LPNN-Approximation, we prove that the state of the network globally converges to the optimal solution of the sparse portfolio problem. Meanwhile, for the LPNN-LCA, we prove that all the equilibrium points of its dynamics correspond to the optimal solution of the sparse portfolio problem and are asymptotically stable. In addition, the realizations of the two models are discussed. Specifically, a thorough circuit realization for the thresholding elements of the LPNN-LCA model is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by a number of numerical experiments, which show that the two proposed models outperform two state-of-the-art analog models.

AB We study the problem of restoring visual stimuli from visually-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Using a supervised classification-then-generation framework, the reconstruction-based approaches learn the mapping between distributions of two modalities but fail to reproduce the exact visual stimulus. Instead, we propose a self-supervised cross-modal retrieval paradigm that seeks instance-level alignment by maximizing the mutual information between the EEG encoding and associated visual stimulus. We demonstrate the threefold advantages of the self-supervised retrieval over supervised reconstruction on the largest visual-evoked EEG dataset with two evaluation protocols. First, it restores the exact visual stimulus without accessing the image class information, which was not possible with previous approaches. Second, it produces more recognizable results than generated ones and bypasses the challenge of training an image generator. Finally, it illustrates the benefits of self-supervision over supervised models in handling open-set data.

AB Domain adaptation involves adapting a model trained on one domain to work effectively on another, which can have different statistical properties, such as distributions, correlations, and relationships between features. These heterogeneities can lead to uncertainty, impacting the model's performance. Despite many studies that have been done on domain adaptation, most have ignored the adverse impact of uncertain and noisy data on adaptation and classification. To address this issue, the proposed method, Adaptive Belief-based Twin Support Vector Data Description (ABT-SVDD), extends the one class support vector data description (SVDD) to an adaptive twin classifier and integrates it with a belief-based sample weighting approach. Also, it utilizes a combination of Hermite polynomial and Gaussian kernels to enhance the computational power of the linear objective function of the SVDD classifier while improving the generalization capability. The effectiveness of ABT-SVDD has been compared to the state-of-the-art methods on several tasks taken from two benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ABT-SVDD significantly improves classification accuracy on various tasks with varying amounts of labeled data in the target domain. Specifically, in normal situations, ABT-SVDD outperforms competing methods by 6.33% to 9.08%, while in noisy situations, it achieves a more significant improvement of 9.87% compared to the competing methods. Besides, the Wilcoxon statistical test demonstrates the superiority of ABT-SVDD over state-of-the-art ones in terms of classification accuracy and computational time.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, introducing nonconvex loss functions in support vector machine (SVM) to improve the robustness against varies noises has been drawing much attention. In this paper, we first construct a new robust capped asymmetric elastic net (CaEN) loss function. Second, we describe a novel robust Huberized kernel-based (HK) loss function and theoretically demonstrate several important properties, such as smoothness, boundness and the trade-off between the standard least squares and the truncated least squares. Finally, we apply the CaEN loss and the HK loss into elastic net nonparallel hyperplane SVM (ENNHSVM) to develop a fused robust geometric nonparallel SVM (FRGNHSVM). The proposed FRGNHSVM not only inherits the advantages of ENNHSVM but also improves the robustness of classification problems. An efficient Pegasos-based DC (difference of convex functions) algorithm is implemented to solve the FRGNHSVM optimization problem. In comparison with four famous SVMs, including Lagrangian SVM, twin SVM, pinball SVM and C-loss twin SVM, experimental results on simulations and twelve UCI datasets show that the proposed FRGNHSVM can often improve more than 5% average prediction accuracy. Moreover, the performance of the high prediction accuracy of FRGHNSVM is more significant along with the ratio of label noise increasing, indicating its superiority in dealing with label-contaminated datasets.

AB Two-phase flow regime identification is an essential transdisciplinary topic that spans digital signal processing, artificial intelligence, chemical engineering, and energy. Multiphase flow systems significantly impact pipeline safety, heat transfer, and pressure drop; therefore, precisely identifying the governing flow regime is crucial for effective modeling and design. However, it is challenging due to the geometrical complexity of flow regimes in multiphase flow. With the advances in sensor measurement and machine learning, applying non-destructive tests and self-supervised learning to practical industrial problems has become technically feasible and costeffective. This study applies a weak-supervised learning-based twophase flow regime identification solution using a nondestructive tests ultrasonic sensor in an S-shape riser experimental bed by proposing a self-supervised feature extraction algorithm. The proposed selfsupervised feature extraction algorithm reduces time/labor consumption and human error in data annotation using SSL, which provides full supervision without manual annotation. The self-supervised feature extraction algorithm uses a bottlenecked neural network and encoder-decoder structure to extract compact features. The self-supervised feature extraction algorithm performance is evaluated using an established convolutional neural network-based classifier. The source data was collected from a 10 x 50 m riser experimental rig. The dataset is made available to the community as part of this study. The performance of the approach is comparable with state-of-the-art methods and is also the first successful attempt to apply selfsupervised learning to multiphase flow regime ultrasonic signal identification. This study achieved 98.84%, 0.000663, 0.00312, and 7.71 x 105 in accuracy, root mean square error, categorical cross-entropy, and model complexity, respectively. The practical experiment justifies the robustness, fairness, and practicability in the practical application environment. The proposed self-supervised feature extraction brings new approaches and inspirations for the feature extraction step in identifying a two-phase flow regime, and it will be beneficial to generalize this study in different riser shapes in the future.

AB This paper focuses on the approach for solving the satisfactory Pareto-optimal solutions of the general form of bilevel multi-followers programming(BMFP), including the BMFP with partial shared variables among followers, the so-called referential-uncooperative BMFP, the uncooperative BMFP, and the cooperative BMFP. Without losing generality, the BMFP with partial shared variables among followers will be taken as a representative to explain the universal applicability of the proposed generic interactive intuitionistic fuzzy method. Based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set, the new definition of satisfactory Pareto-optimal solutions is introduced by means of membership function, non-membership function, and score function. In order to obtain satisfactory Pareto-optimal solutions of BMFP with partial shared variables among followers, a prior minimization optimization problem and a series of corresponding auxiliary maximization optimization problems are formulated, and we strictly prove that the optimal solution of the prior minimization optimization problem is not necessarily the satisfactory Pareto-optimal solutions, but at least one satisfactory Pareto optimal solution can be derived by further solving these auxiliary maximization optimization problems. Then, a detailed interactive intuitionistic fuzzy algorithm framework that consider both the balance of satisfactory degree between the leader and the followers and the balance of satisfactory degree among all followers is proposed. In the part of numerical experiments, four examples(including a linear BMFP problem with partial shared variables among followers, a BMFP model of a road network problem, an uncooperative BMFP problem, and a nonlinear BMFP problem with partial shared variables among followers) are illustrated to demonstrate the applicability, effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed technique.

AB Industrialization has advanced quickly, bringing intelligent production and manufacturing into people's daily lives, but it has also created a number of issues with the ability of intelligent control systems for industrial robots. As a result, a study has been conducted on the use of multi-source data fusion methods in the mechanical industry. First, the research analyzes and discusses the existing research at home and abroad. Then, a robot intelligent control system based on multi-source fusion method is proposed, which combines multi-source data fusion with principal component analysis to better fuse data of multiple control periods; In the process, the experimental results are dynamically evaluated, and the performance of the proposed method is compared with other fusion methods. The results of the study showed that the confidence values and recognition correctness of the intelligent control system under the proposed method were superior compared to the Yu, Murphy, and Deng methods. Applying the method to the comparison of real-time and historical data values, it is found that the predicted data under the proposed method fits better with the actual data values, and the fit can be as high as 0.9945. The dynamic evaluation analysis of single and multi-factor in the simulation stage demonstrates that the control ability in the training samples of 0-100 is often better than the actual results, and the best evaluation results may be obtained at the sample size of 50 per batch. The aforementioned findings demonstrated that the multi-data fusion method that was suggested had a high degree of viability and accuracy for the intelligent control system of industrial robots and could offer a fresh line of enquiry for the advancement and development of the mechanical industrialization field.

AB This article proposed a hybrid search mode-based differential evolution (HSM-DE) algorithm to overcome the complex design of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS). First, transform complex design processes of the IT2FLS into optimization problems for our proposed evolutionary algorithm by decoding the whole system into design parameters regarded as search objectives. Then, the DE algorithm with a rapid convergence characteristic is adopted as a global search method for exploration according to a memetic algorithm (MA) structure. Considering the conventional DE algorithm is lack of escaping ability for the local optimal solution, a local search method combined with a simulated binary crossover (SBX) and polynomial mutation (PM) is utilized to enhance the exploitation behavior of our proposed method. In addition, simple constraints on the design parameters of the membership function are added to balance the searching freedom of the HSM-DE algorithm and the readability of the optimal IT2FLS. Finally, a simulation of a mobile two-wheel vehicle (MTWV) under a goal search task is performed to verify the effectiveness of the optimal IT2FLS auto designed by HSM-DE. All results demonstrate that the HSM-DE realizes auto design for the IT2FLS with high-performance control and outperforms the comparative methods. Moreover, four comparison methods are performed to validate the high-performance of the proposed HSM-DE on the search ability of the optimal solution.

DE Mild policy evaluation (MPE); offline actor-critic (AC); offline
   reinforcement learning (RL); value function difference
AB In offline actor-critic (AC) algorithms, the distributional shift between the training data and target policy causes optimistic Q value estimates for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This leads to learned policies skewed toward OOD actions with falsely high Q values. The existing value-regularized offline AC algorithms address this issue by learning a conservative value function, leading to a performance drop. In this article, we propose a mild policy evaluation (MPE) by constraining the difference between the Q values of actions supported by the target policy and those of actions contained within the offline dataset. The convergence of the proposed MPE, the gap between the learned value function and the true one, and the suboptimality of the offline AC with MPE are analyzed, respectively. A mild offline AC (MOAC) algorithm is developed by integrating MPE into off-policy AC. Compared with existing offline AC algorithms, the value function gap of MOAC is bounded by the existence of sampling errors. Moreover, in the absence of sampling errors, the true state value function can be obtained. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MPE and the performance superiority of MOAC compared to the state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.

AB This article concentrates on proposing a scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for a multiple unmanned surface vehicle (multi-USV) system to operate coop-erative target invasion. The multi-USV system, which is made up of multiple invaders, needs to invade target areas in a specified time. A novel scalable reinforcement learning (RL) method called Scalable-MADDPG is proposed for the first time. In this method, the scale of the multi-USV system can be changed at any time without interrupting the training process. Then, to mitigate the policy oscillation after applying Scalable-MADDPG, a bi-directional long-short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is constructed. Moreover, an improved ?-greedy strategy is proposed to help balance the exploration and exploitation in RL. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the optimal policy, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise is added in this improved ?-greedy strategy during the training process. Finally, the scalable RL method is used to help the multi-USV system perform cooperative target invasion under complex marine environments. The effectiveness of Scalable-MADDPG is demonstrated through three experiments.

AB Facility location models involve identifying locations for facilities that provide services to the customers which are also called demand points. The p-median problem is a facility location problem which deals with locating p facilities in such a way that the sumtotal of demand-weighted distances between each demand point and its respective closest facility is minimized. The p-median problem does not take into account the possibility of failure of the facilities, but rather considers that the facilities once located will always be available to serve the customers or demand points. But, in reality, some of the facilities may face unpredicted disruptions, thereby forcing the customers to seek services from other functioning facilities. The reliability p-median problem (RpMP) concerns with locating facilities which minimize the cost while considering the cost of facility failures. In this paper, we have proposed a hyper-heuristic approach with naive Bayes classifier for the RpMP and compared its performance on standard benchmark instances with two best performing approaches for RpMP, viz. a genetic algorithm and a scatter search approach available in the literature. The results show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of the solution quality.

AB Machine learning has successfully achieved the ultimate goal to mimic intelligent human behavior in data-abundance problems but is often hampered in data scarcity problems. To tackle this, computer vision presents a low-cost solution by introducing a fundamental concept called "Few-Shot Learning (FSL)" which helps to bridge the gap between AI, ML, and human-like learning. FSL makes learning models to generalize in low-shot regimes, hence avoiding strenuous human tasks like the collection of huge datasets, arduous labeling, or preprocessing. Data modality, domain adaptation, domain shifts, and discrepancy of the implementation details among multiple FSL algorithms are major challenges and of great interest in FSL models. Metric-based models successfully attempt to learn within tasks, however, they often fail to generalize across tasks due to the large disparity of feature distributions. In our study, we introduce a class-covariance based metric-learner that adopts Mahalanobis distance as a metric function to enhance few-shot classification performance significantly within and across domains. Feature-wise modulation layers are also introduced and integrated with a feature encoder at multiple steps to augment and diversify the distribution of image features which makes our model learning-to-generalize across domains as well. Meta-learning based optimization algorithm is adopted to fine-tune the hyper-parameters involved. Evaluation and analysis of experimental procedures compare favorably against other state-of-the-art FSL methods and justify the use of a covariance-based metric model and learned feature-wise modulation layers.

AB Polygraphs are used in criminal interrogations to detect deception. However, polygraphs can be difficult to administer under circumstances that prevent the use of biosensors. To address the shortcomings of the biosensors, deception-detection technology without biosensors is needed. We propose a deception-detection method, FacialCueNet, which is a multi-modal network that utilizes both facial images and facial cues based on deep-learning technology. FacialCueNet incorporates facial cues that indicate deception, such as action-unit frequency, symmetry, gaze pattern, and micro-expressions extracted from videos. Additionally, the spatial-temporal attention module, based on convolutional neural network and convolutional long short-term memory, is applied to FacialCueNet to provide interpretable information from interrogations. Because our goal was developing an algorithm applicable to criminal interrogations, we trained and evaluated FacialCueNet using the DDCIT dataset, which was collected using a data acquisition protocol similar to those used in actual investigations. To compare deception-detection performance with state-of-the-art works, a public dataset was also used. As a result, the mean deception-detection F1 score using the DDCIT dataset was 81.22%, with an accuracy of 70.79%, recall of 0.9476, and precision of 0.7107. When evaluating against the public database, our method demonstrated an evaluation accuracy of 88.45% and achieved an AUC of 0.9541, indicating a improvement of 1.25% compared to the previous results. We also present interpretive results of deception detection by analyzing the influence of spatial and temporal factors. These results show that FacialCueNet has the potential to detect deception using only facial videos. By providing interpretation of predictions, our system could be useful tool for criminal interrogation.

AB Periodic frequent-pattern mining (PFPM) is a vital knowledge discovery technique that identifies periodically occurring patterns in a temporal database. Although traditional PFPM algorithms have many applications, they often produce a large set of periodic-frequent patterns (PFPs) in a database. As a result, analyzing PFPs can be very time-consuming for users. Moreover, a large set of PFPs makes PFPM algorithms less efficient regarding runtime and memory consumption. This paper handles this problem by proposing a novel model of closed periodic-frequent patterns (CPFPs) found in databases. CPFPs are less expensive to mine because they represent a concise and lossless subset uniquely describing the entire set of PFPs. We also present an efficient depth-first search algorithm, called Closed Periodic-Frequent Pattern-Miner (CPFP-Miner), to discover the patterns. The proposed algorithm utilizes the weighted ordering of the patterns concept to reduce the patterns' search space. On the other hand, the current periodicity concept is also applied to prune aperiodic patterns from the search space. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic databases demonstrate that the CPFP-Miner algorithm is efficient. It outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding runtime requirements, memory consumption, and energy consumption on several real-world and synthetic databases. Additionally, the scalability of the CPFP-Miner algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective and productive than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we present two case studies to show the functionality of the proposed patterns.

ID NATURAL SCENE STATISTICS; INFORMATION; NETWORK
AB Super-resolution (SR) image quality assessment (SRIQA) is a fundamental topic in the literature of SR domain. Most existing SR methods usually adopt full reference (FR) metrics which need the original images as reference, to evaluate the performance of different SR algorithms and the quality of resultant SR images. However, in practice the original HR images are not available for FR-SRIQA. Therefore, it is particularly meaningful to develop a no-reference (NR) SRIQA metric to assess SR algorithms. In this paper, a novel NR-SRIQA metric comprised of a cascade two-layer regression model is presented. The newly proposed method first employs three different kinds of perceptual statistical features to measure the degradation of SR images. Then a cascade two-layer regression framework with three independent AdaBoost Decision Tree Regression (DTR) models and one ridge regression model, is developed to build the mapping relationship from the obtained statistical features to the corresponding subjective quality scores in a coarse-to-fine manner. Thorough evaluation experiments on the benchmark database proposed by Ma et al. (Comput Vis Image Understand 158:1-16 2017) confirm that the proposed NR-SRIQA metric is capable of yielding more consistent perceptual quality assessment on SR images than other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB This article starts from the observation that practices of 'algorithmic governmentality' or 'governance by data' are reconfiguring modes of social relationality and collectivity. By building, first, on an empirical exploration of digital bordering practices, we qualify these emergent algorithmic categories as 'clusters'-pulsing patterns distilled from disaggregated data. As fluid, modular, and ever-emergent forms of association, these 'clusters' defy stable expressions of collective representation and social recognition. Second, we observe that this empirical analysis resonates with accounts that diagnosed algorithmic governance as a threat to legal subjectivity and socio-political cohesion, and called for a reinvigoration of democratic values and their re-alignment with new 'infrastructural publics'. Against this backdrop, however, we explore alternatives avenues of legal imagination by pushing in a different (somewhat opposite) direction. Against the re-inscription of liberal categories, we linger with the promise and prospect of illegibility as resistance against the foreclosure of future potentialities in algorithmic forms of subject-making. Instead of falling back on the projection of autonomous human agency and liberal subjectivity to counteract the 'cluster', we imagine emancipatory expressions of resistance that are enacted through fugitive, opaque, and experimental collectivities.

AB In this article, a dynamic event-triggered adaptive antidisturbance (ETAAD) switching control strategy is proposed for switched systems subject to multisource disturbances. The disturbances are divided into two categories: the available unmodeled disturbance and the unavailable dynamic neural network modeled disturbance. First, a dynamic ET criterion is set based on the system state. Then, a novel dynamic ETA disturbance estimator is introduced to observe the modeled disturbance. Furthermore, according to the ET rule and adaptive disturbance observer, a switched controller is designed. Next, under the controller and switching criterion with the average dwell time limitation, sufficient conditions are given to force the switched systems to realize multisource disturbance suppression (DS), trajectory tracking, and communication resource (CR) saving simultaneously. Meanwhile, the Zeno phenomenon may be caused by the ET rule being excluded. In addition, the presented ETAAD approach is also applicable to the nonswitched systems case. Finally, a simulation case is given to validate the effectiveness of the dynamic ETAAD switching control method.

TI Intra- & Extra-Source Exemplar-Based Style Synthesis for Improved Domain
   Generalization

DT Article; Early Access
DE Domain generalization; GAN inversion; Data augmentation; Semantic
   segmentation
AB The generalization with respect to domain shifts, as they frequently appear in applications such as autonomous driving, is one of the remaining big challenges for deep learning models. Therefore, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis pipeline to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation. Our method is based on a novel masked noise encoder for StyleGAN2 inversion. The model learns to faithfully reconstruct the image, preserving its semantic layout through noise prediction. Random masking of the estimated noise enables the style mixing capability of our model, i.e. it allows to alter the global appearance without affecting the semantic layout of an image. Using the proposed masked noise encoder to randomize style and content combinations in the training set, i.e., intra-source style augmentation (ISSA) effectively increases the diversity of training data and reduces spurious correlation. As a result, we achieve up to 12.4% mIoU improvements on driving-scene semantic segmentation under different types of data shifts, i.e., changing geographic locations, adverse weather conditions, and day to night. ISSA is model-agnostic and straightforwardly applicable with CNNs and Transformers. It is also complementary to other domain generalization techniques, e.g., it improves the recent state-of-the-art solution RobustNet by 3% mIoU in Cityscapes to Dark Zurich. In addition, we demonstrate the strong plug-n-play ability of the proposed style synthesis pipeline, which is readily usable for extra-source exemplars e.g., web-crawled images, without any retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, we study a new use case to indicate neural network's generalization capability by building a stylized proxy validation set. This application has significant practical sense for selecting models to be deployed in the open-world environment. Our code is available at https://github.com/boschresearch/ISSA.

AB Transferring knowledge from pre-trained deep models for downstream tasks, particularly with limited labeled samples, is a fundamental problem in computer vision research. Recent advances in large-scale, task-agnostic vision-language pre-trained models, which are learned with billions of samples, have shed new light on this problem. In this study, we investigate how to efficiently transfer aligned visual and textual knowledge for downstream visual recognition tasks. We first revisit the role of the linear classifier in the vanilla transfer learning framework, and then propose a new paradigm where the parameters of the classifier are initialized with semantic targets from the textual encoder and remain fixed during optimization. To provide a comparison, we also initialize the classifier with knowledge from various resources. In the empirical study, we demonstrate that our paradigm improves the performance and training speed of transfer learning tasks. With only minor modifications, our approach proves effective across 17 visual datasets that span three different data domains: image, video, and 3D point cloud.

TI Learning Robust Facial Representation From the View of Diversity and

AB Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in deep face recognition due to the advancement of both deep convolutional neural networks and loss functions. In this work, we provide an intrinsic analysis to reveal the working mechanism of softmax from the view of closeness and diversity. We find that enhancing the closeness of easy samples and preserving the diversity of hard samples can improve feature representation robustness. However, most of the previous works aim to improve the closeness of intraclass samples and fail to emphasize hard sample diversity. To solve the above issue, we developed a novel robust feature representation model, which leverages the rate-distortion theory to characterize the proportions of closeness and diversity, in conjunction with the designed hard sample mining scheme to further enhance the discriminative ability of the deep model. Specifically, the proposed model compresses the coding rate of easy samples for closeness, and expands the coding rate of hard samples for diversity. A novel hard sample mining scheme is designed to ensure that easy samples and hard samples are balanced in each batch. For each batch, we also guarantee that hard samples are both from the intraclass samples led by various noises and from the interclass samples with similar appearances. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art competitors.

AB Early seizure prediction is crucial for epilepsy patients to reduce accidental injuries and improve their quality of life. Identifying pre-ictal EEG from the inter-ictal state is particularly challenging due to their nonictal nature and remarkable similarities. In this study, a novel epileptic seizure prediction method is proposed based on multi-head attention (MHA) augmented convolutional neural network (CNN) to address the issue of CNN's limit of capturing global information of input signals. First, data enhancement is performed on original EEG recordings to balance the pre-ictal and inter-ictal EEG data, and the EEG recordings are sliced into 6-second-long EEG segments. Subsequently, EEG time-frequency distribution is obtained using Stockwell transform (ST), and the attention augmented convolutional network is employed for feature extraction and classification. Finally, post-processing is utilized to reduce the false prediction rate (FPR). The CHB-MIT EEG database was used to evaluate the system. The validation results showed a segment-based sensitivity of 98.24% and an event-based sensitivity of 94.78% with a FPR of 0.05/h were yielded, respectively. The satisfying results of the proposed method demonstrate its possible potential for clinical applications.

AB Recently, the plantation of sugarcane is done in mechanized manner with billets that are short segments of sugarcane harvested. The automated harvesting procedure can destroy billets and reduces quality of billets. Deep convolution neural network is applied to diagnose sugarcane billet damage (DCNN). A novel technique, namely Aquila Sailfish Optimizer (ASO) algorithm is devised for weight update of neurons in training the DCNN and enhances the efficiency of DCNN. The ASO is obtained by incorporating Aquila Optimizer (AO) and Sailfish Optimizer (SFO). The classification of sugarcane billet damage is done by Chronological Aquila Sailfish Optimizer (CASO) algorithm trained Deep Quantum Neural Network (DQNN), which is trained with obtained by incorporating Chronological concept in ASO. Here, the sugarcane billet damage will be classified into five types, including Crushed (blue), Cracked (red), No buds (yellow), Two buds (green) and Single damaged bud (orange). The developed CASO-based DQNN presented highest precision of 91%, recall of 93.3%, F-measure of 92.1%, and accuracy of 91.5%.

AB An Optimization Driven Spike Deep Belief Neural Networks is a type of neural network that is inspired by the functioning of the human brain. It is a variant of the more general class of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), which are artificial neural networks composed of multiple layers of hidden units. Spike sorting is a critical process in neural signal processing that involves separating and identifying individual action potentials, spikes, from extracellular recordings of neuronal activity. This process is essential for understanding the behaviour of individual neurons and for decoding neural signals in various applications, such as Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) and neuro science research. Spike sorting is challenging due to the complexity of the recorded signals, including overlapping spikes and noise from other sources. This manuscript proposes A deep-learning based Multichannel Spike Sorting Neural Signal Processor (SSNSP) Module for High-Channel-Count Brain Machine Interfaces to record spike activity (SA) of brain neuron signals with less noise. Here first data acquisition is first step and the data's are took form Neural Signal Processor (NSP). Then the collected features are stored in BMIs. After this process feature is extracted using Haar DWT. Haar DWT is a frequency based feature extractor used to extract the spike or noisy signals from the neuron signals. Then the extracted features are given to driven spike DBN, this is a combination of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer and DBN. To increase the accuracy, Adam-Cuckoo Search optimization is used, which optimize the driven spike DBN weight parameter. An FPGA was used to construct and test a prototype 32-channel SSNSP component based on this analysis. Synthesised signals are used at various signals to noise ratios. Then, human neurons are classified based on the channels containing neural spike data. The impact of busy as well as idle state prediction errors on the spectrum efficacy is examined. The proposed technique is implemented in MATLAB platform. Finally, the proposed technique attains better detection accuracy 22.86%, 28.94%, 31.11% and 27.34% compared to the existing models, like Deep Learning Laser Speckle Contrast ESNN (DL-LSC-ESNN), Highly Stretchable Hydro gels as Wearable with Implantable Sensors for Recording Physiological with Brain Neural Signals (HSN-WIS-RPBNS), Lower-power band of neuronal spiking action dominated through local single units enhances the Presentation of BMI (LPB-NSA-LSU-BMI) and Emotion Categorization Utilizing Feature Fusion of Multimodal Data along Deep Learning in Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network (EC-FFMD-BISNN) respectively.

AB In the age of big data, the number of class labels is increasing rapidly and there exists a hierarchical structure between different class labels. In the present paper, we revisit the existing granular computing approach to hierarchical classification. By revealing some limitations of approximation capacity, we develop a novel model for hierarchical classification. Then, we present a formal approach to feature selection for hierarchical decision tables by using fuzzy rough set theory. Correspondingly, an algorithm using relative discernibility relation is designed to select relevant feature subsets. Considering the fact that real data may vary dynamically with time, we also propose an incremental approach to hierarchical feature selection by using fuzzy rough set technique. An incremental algorithm for hierarchical feature selection is provided based on the sibling strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible and valid.

   Explanation
AB User-item interactions on e-commerce platforms involve various intents, such as browsing and purchasing, which require fine-grained intent recognition. Existing recommendation methods incorporate latent intent into user-item interactions; however, they overlook important considerations. First, they fail to integrate intents with semantic information in knowledge graphs, neglecting intent interpretability. Second, they do not exploit the structural information from multiple views of latent intents in user-item interactions. This study established the intent with knowledge-aware multiview contrastive learning (IKMCL) model for explanation in recommendation systems. The proposed IKMCL model converts latent intent into fine-grained intent, calculates intent weights, mines latent semantic information, and learns the representation of user-item interactions through multiview intent contrastive learning. In particular, we combined fine-grained intents with a knowledge graph to calculate intent weights and capture intent semantics. The IKMCL model performs multiview intent contrastive learning at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels to extract semantic relationships in user-item interactions and provide intent recommendations in structural and semantic views. In addition, an intent-relational path was designed based on multiview contrastive learning, enabling the capture of semantic information from latent intents and personalized item recommendations with interpretability. Experimental results using large benchmark datasets indicated that the proposed model outperformed other advanced methods, significantly improving recommendation performance.

DE Strong tracking filter; Multi-target tracking; Object tacking; Computer
   vision; Linear system
AB Object tracking technology based on image processing has made great progress recently. Based on the track-by-detection framework, the tracking algorithms are often combined with deep neural networks to perform online target tracking. However, existing motion models assume linearity and are sensitive to sudden changes in trajectories due to occlusion, overlap, or other detection issues. In this paper, we modified the existing object tracking algorithms and introduced a strong tracking filter (STF) module to the track-by-detection framework for solving the sudden change problem of the target. The STF module is designed to have a strong ability to track sudden changes by orthogonalizing the residual sequence. When the trajectory of the target is stable, the STF module returns to the inactive state, behaving similarly to tracking algorithms that follow conventional linear models. Experimental results on a public pedestrian tracking dataset show that the proposed method improves tracking performance on various metrics, including the ability to rematch missed trajectories. Moreover, compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method exhibits strong stability under noisy conditions.

AB Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are a graph-based methodology successfully applied for knowledge representation of complex systems modelled through an interactive structure of nodes connected with causal relationships. Due to their flexibility and inherent interpretability, FCMs have been used in various modelling and prediction tasks to support human decisions. However, a notable limitation of FCMs is their susceptibility to inadvertently capturing spurious correlations from data, undermining their prediction accuracy and interpretability. In addressing this challenge, our primary contribution is the introduction of a novel framework for constructing FCMs using the Liang-Kleeman Information Flow (L-K IF) analysis, a quantitative causality analysis rigorously derived from first principles. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the identification of actual causal relationships from the data using an automatic causal search algorithm. These relationships are subsequently imposed as constraints in the FCM learning procedure to rule out spurious correlations and improve the aggregate predictive and explanatory power of the model. Numerical simulations validate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art FCM-based models, thereby bolstering the reliability, accuracy, and interpretability of FCMs.

AB Recently, the digitalization process generates an enormous amount of multimedia data that turn out to be further difficult to manage. The current developments in big data technology and the cloud computing (CC) field produce massive growth in cloud data. The accessible memory space was used by the enormous replication data and generates the highest computation cost which is the most important problem in the constrained cloud storage space. Therefore, in this study, we introduced a novel secure cloud data deduplication (SCDD) approach to improve data security and data storage of the cloud environment by generating optimal key and deduplicating files respectively. The proposed approach mainly focuses on reducing computational cost and memory utilization of the cloud application. Here, the utilized data files are encrypted using the proxy re-encryption approach, and the refraction learning-based chimp optimization (RL-CO) algorithm is utilized for optimal key generation process as a result it guarantees better cloud security to the end users to store data on the cloud. Subsequently, the optimal verified fuzzy keyword search (OVFKS) approach is proposed to eliminate duplicate files or copies of actual data thereby enhancing the cloud storage space considerably. The proposed secure cloud data deduplication-based optimal verified fuzzy keyword search (SCDD-OVFKS)approach utilizes three different data files namely android application data, audio files, and mixed application data files, audio files, and other relevant files as the input. Furthermore, the proposed approach's performance is validated using different performance measures namely computational time, computational cost, search time cost, memory utilization, and deduplication rate by examining other state-of-art approaches. As a result, the proposed SCDD-OVFKS approach achieves a maximum deduplication rate of about 28.6% for 8 MB along with minimum computational cost and reduced memory utilization than other state-of-art approaches.

DE Traversability; Aerial images; Fully convolutional neural networks
AB Traversability analysis is essential for ground robot operations because it allows the incorporation of knowledge about traversable and non-traversable terrains into the robot's path planning algorithm. It is possible to use aerial data to compute traversability maps for large regions and use them to assist in ground robot navigation. In the literature that concerns path planning from aerial images, we found two main approaches to generate traversability maps: terrain classification or heuristics to determine traversability. However, methods based on classification or handcrafted heuristics exhibit limitations with regard to the accuracy and precision of the traversability maps, quality of calculated paths and processing time. This work explores a new method to compute a traversability map from an aerial image in one forward pass through a fully convolutional neural network. The objective is to quickly generate good quality traversability maps for use in the path planning phase of navigation algorithms. We evaluate our proposal in comparison to other approaches available in the literature to demonstrate that it provides valuable information for a planner algorithm to compute safe and cost-efficient paths using only images.

AB The receptive field of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is focused on the local context, while the transformer receptive field is concerned with the global context. Transformers are the new backbone of computer vision due to their powerful ability to extract global features, which is supported by pre-training on extensive amounts of data. However, it is challenging to collect a large number of high-quality labeled images for the pre-training phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a classification network (CofaNet) that combines CNNs and transformer-based fused attention to address the limitations of transformers without pre-training, such as low accuracy. CofaNet introduces patch sequence dimension attention to capture the relationship among subsequences and incorporates it into self-attention to construct a new attention feature extraction layer. Then, a residual convolution block is used instead of multi-layer perception after the fusion attention layer to compensate for the limited feature extraction of the attention layer on small datasets. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CofaNet achieves excellent classification accuracy when compared to some transformer-based networks without pre-traning.

AB Around the world, lung disease is a prevalent cause of death and illness. In this article, we propose a lung disease detection system for the automated identification of critical lung diseases: 1. Tuberculosis 2. Regular Pneumonia 3. COVID Pneumonia and healthy individuals from chest X-ray (CXR) images. The proposed system incorporates a two-stage classification method using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We evaluated the performance of the proposed system using various evaluation metrics with a test set containing 200 normal, 100 Tuberculosis, 200 Regular Pneumonia, and 100 COVID Pneumonia (a total of 600) CXR images. The proposed system achieves an average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99 and an accuracy of 0.99. The performance of the proposed system based on F1-Score (0.99) for three classes, namely Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, and COVID, is better than the following existing classification frameworks: ensemble of K-ResNets for the same three classes (F1-Score: 0.84), modified ResNet50 (F1-Score:0.89), KNN classifier with fractional multi-channel exponent moments (F1-Score: 0.89), VGG-16 (F1-Score: 0.89), and convolutional sparse support estimator network (F1-Score for COVID: 0.78). The proposed system can also determine the confidence associated with the challenging classification of Regular Vs. COVID Pneumonia. We also utilized visualization techniques like Grad-CAM and Saliency maps to analyze the features learned by the CNNs, to create transparency in the prediction.

AB This study introduces a new and inventive approach designed to address the complex challenges encountered in the domain of image super-resolution (SR) tasks based on deep learning. The super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) is an innovative architecture that integrates the concept of residual learning into the complex design of deep recursive neural networks. This integration is aimed at significantly improving the quality of generated images. To attain the intended improvement in image quality, a series of varied loss functions are used in progressive manner, incorporating the structural similarity index (SSIM) loss and the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which are grounded on the perceptual loss paradigm. The carefully crafted loss functions are designed to enhance and maintain the fundamental element of structural integrity in the generated images, which is a critical requirement for dependable image super-resolution. The proposed methodology encountered a thorough evaluation through a series of rigors assessments, using developed benchmark datasets that are frequently used in the relevant field. Through an evaluation of the model's performance with respect to image quality and structural similarity, we have effectively determined its effectiveness and ability to enhance current efforts aimed at advancing the field of image super-resolution. The results obtained exhibit a high-level accuracy, with the rate of 99.04%, and a less loss value of 3.19%. by achieving SSIM score of 0.97, PSNR score of 34.6, and MSE score of 0.012.

AB The growing impact of ecological theories and environmental preservation has resulted in a movement towards people-oriented design approaches for ecological landscape creation. However, certain university campuses continue to suffer hardships due to underutilized terrains and severe damage caused by large-scale earthworks. Given the new waves of campus growth, there is an urgent need to address these difficulties and consider the planning and design of natural biological landscapes on various campuses of Jiangsu province. A more scientific approach to maintaining ecological balance, protecting biodiversity, and increasing landscape variation on campuses may be taken by combining ecological environment conservation with university landscape design. Based on summarizing and analyzing previous research, this paper takes the Nanjing Communications Institute of Technology as a case study and expounds on the research status and significance of university campus landscape design in Jiangsu Province. Firstly, this study elaborates on the background, current status and future challenges of the concept of ecological environment protection, introduces the study objects, indicators and constituent elements of landscape design of the university campus, and conducts the ecological analysis. Secondly, this paper uses regression analysis to investigate the complex interactions between ecological features and the Ecological Balance Index (EBI) in university campus landscape design. Our suggested design reveals links between various design aspects and overall ecological-aesthetic attributes Inspired by the Principle of Landscape Diversity Design. In addition, we quantified landscape diversity and spatial optimization using the Shannon Diversity Index and Space Utilization Efficiency. Third, this research analyzes the space and visual forms of the landscape on the university campus and proposes a landscape design model for it using ecological environment protection. Third, it explores the expression methods of ecological environment protection and conducts the space division and index selection of landscape design. Finally, this paper discusses the landscape design approaches for university campuses to protect the ecological environment. In experimental work, the paper evaluates and compares several landscape design methodologies. Our proposed design exceeded previous approaches in terms of ecological balance (83%), aesthetic appeal (91%), and sustainability (93%). The proposed design is beneficial in protecting the environment and improving the overall quality of university campuses. These findings provide useful insights and references for future study in landscape design for university campuses in Jiangsu Province under the ecological environment preservation paradigm.

AB This work addresses the rolling element bearing (REB) fault classification problem by tackling the issue of identifying the appropriate parameters for the extreme learning machine (ELM) and enhancing its effectiveness. This study introduces a memetic algorithm (MA) to identify the optimal ELM parameter set for compact ELM architecture alongside better ELM performance. The goal of using MA is to investigate the promising solution space and systematically exploit the facts in the viable solution space. In the proposed method, the local search method is proposed along with link-based and node-based genetic operators to provide a tight ELM structure. A vibration data set simulated from the bearing of rotating machinery has been used to assess the performance of the optimized ELM with the REB fault categorization problem. The complexity involved in choosing a promising feature set is eliminated because the vibration data has been transformed into kurtograms to reflect the input of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that MA efficiently optimizes the ELM to improve the fault classification accuracy by around 99.0% and reduces the requirement of hidden nodes by 17.0% for both data sets. As a result, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to be a practically acceptable and well-organized solution that offers a compact ELM architecture in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for the fault classification problem.

AB Moving from a behavioral definition of intelligence, which describes it as the ability to adapt to the surrounding environment and deal effectively with new situations (Anastasi, 1986), this paper explains to what extent the performance obtained by ChatGPT in the linguistic domain can be considered as intelligent behavior and to what extent they cannot. It also explains in what sense the hypothesis of decoupling between cognitive and problem-solving abilities, proposed by Floridi (2017) and Floridi and Chiriatti (2020) should be interpreted. The problem of symbolic grounding (Harnad, 1990) is then addressed to show the problematic relationship between ChatGPT and the natural environment, and thus the impossibility for it to understand the symbols it manipulates. To explain the reasons why ChatGPT does not succeed in this task, an investigation is carried out and a possible solution to the problem in the artificial domain is proposed by making a comparison with the natural ability of living beings to ground their own meanings from some basic cognitive-sensory aspects, which, it is explained, are directly related to the emergence of self-awareness in humans. Thus, the question is raised whether a possible and concrete solution to the Symbol Grounding Problem would involve in the artificial domain the development of cognitive abilities fully comparable to those of humans. Finally, I explain the difficulties that would have to be overcome before such a level could be reached, since human cognitive capacities are intimately linked to intersubjectivity and intercorporeality.

AB This article addresses the co-evolution of morphology and control in evolutionary robotics, focusing on the challenge of premature convergence and limited morphological diversity. We conduct a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms, focusing on QD (Quality-Diversity) algorithms, based on a well-defined methodology for benchmarking evolutionary algorithms. We introduce carefully chosen indicators to evaluate their performance in three core aspects: task performance, phenotype diversity, and genotype diversity. Our findings highlight MNSLC (Multi-BC NSLC), with the introduction of aligned novelty to NSLC (Novelty Search with Local Competition), as the most effective algorithm for diversity preservation (genotype and phenotype diversity), while maintaining a competitive level of exploitability (task performance). MAP-Elites, although exhibiting a well-balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration, fall short in protecting morphological diversity. NSLC, while showing similar performance to MNSLC in terms of exploration, is the least performant in terms of exploitation, contrasting with QN (Fitness-Novelty MOEA), which exhibits much superior exploitation, but inferior exploration, highlighting the effects of local competition in skewing the balance toward exploration. Our study provides valuable insights into the advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs of different algorithms in co-evolving morphology and control.

ID CHEST RADIOGRAPHS; LUNG SEGMENTATION
AB Due to the acquisition of anatomical/pathological labels is expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised semantic segmentation is commonly utilized in medical image analysis. Previous studies have overlooked the high similarity of the pixels in medical images, resulting in many models cannot effectively distinguish the pixels of different categories. A new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework based on prototype learning is proposed in this paper. It contains a feature extractor and a superpixel-based graph convolutional network (GCN). Two consistency loss functions are proposed in our paper. The prototype cyclic consistency loss is utilized to incorporate explicit guidance of the labeled data; the cross pseudo supervised loss is applied to make full use of the context information of the unlabeled data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on two classical public medical image datasets (MC and JSRT). On MC dataset, the predicted IoU of our method is 94.92 & PLUSMN;0.5% with only 25% annotated data; on JSRT dataset, the MIoU of our method reaches 89.51 & PLUSMN;0.37% (with 25% annotated data) and 90.98 & PLUSMN;0.4% (with 50% annotated data). Our proposed method outperforms most existing semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods, even exceeds the fully supervised semantic segmentation methods, and achieves high-precision semi-supervised semantic segmentation effectively.

AB OCR approaches have been widely advanced in recent years thanks to the resurgence of deep learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little work on Mongolian movable-type document recognition. One major hurdle is the lack of a domain-specific well-labeled set for training robust models. This paper aims to create the first Mongolian movable type text-image dataset for OCR research. We collated 771 paragraph-level pages segmented from 34 newspapers from 1947 to 1952. For each page, word- and line-level text transcriptions and boundary annotations are recorded. It consists of 86,578 word appearances and 9711 text-line images in total. The vocabulary is 7964. The dataset was finally established from scratch through image collection, text transcription, text-image alignment and manual correction. Moreover, an official train and test set partition is defined on which the typical text segmentation and recognition experiments are tested to set the strong baselines. This dataset is available for research, and we encourage researchers to develop and test new methods using our dataset.

ID IMITATION
AB Solving long sequential tasks remains a non-trivial challenge in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. Enabling a robotic system to perform diverse sequential tasks with a broad range of manipulation skills is a notable open problem and continues to be an active area of research. In this work, we present a hybrid hierarchical learning framework, the robotic manipulation network ROMAN, to address the challenge of solving multiple complex tasks over long time horizons in robotic manipulation. By integrating behavioural cloning, imitation learning and reinforcement learning, ROMAN achieves task versatility and robust failure recovery. It consists of a central manipulation network that coordinates an ensemble of various neural networks, each specializing in different recombinable subtasks to generate their correct in-sequence actions, to solve complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Our experiments show that, by orchestrating and activating these specialized manipulation experts, ROMAN generates correct sequential activations accomplishing long sequences of sophisticated manipulation tasks and achieving adaptive behaviours beyond demonstrations, while exhibiting robustness to various sensory noises. These results highlight the significance and versatility of ROMAN's dynamic adaptability featuring autonomous failure recovery capabilities, and underline its potential for various autonomous manipulation tasks that require adaptive motor skills.
   Achieving sequential robotic actions involving different manipulation skills is an open challenge that is critical to enable robots to interact meaningfully with their physical environment. Triantafyllidis and colleagues present a hierarchical learning framework based on an ensemble of specialized neural networks to solve complex long-horizon manipulation tasks.

AB Most molecular generative models based on artificial intelligence for de novo drug design are ligand-centric and do not consider the detailed three-dimensional geometries of protein binding pockets. Pocket-aware three-dimensional molecular generation is challenging due to the need to impose physical equivariance and to evaluate protein-ligand interactions when incrementally growing partially built molecules. Inspired by multiscale modelling in condensed matter and statistical physics, we present a three-dimensional molecular generative model conditioned on protein pockets, termed ResGen, for designing organic molecules inside of a given target. ResGen is built on the principle of parallel multiscale modelling, which can capture higher-level interaction and achieve higher computational efficiency (about eight-times faster than the previous best art). The generation process is formulated as a hierarchical autoregression, that is, a global autoregression for learning protein-ligand interactions and atomic component autoregression for learning each atom's topology and geometry distributions. We demonstrate that ResGen has a higher success rate than existing state-of-the-art approaches in generating novel molecules that can bind to unseen targets more tightly than the original ligands. Moreover, retrospective computational experiments on de novo drug design in real-world scenarios show that ResGen successfully generates drug-like molecules with lower binding energy and higher diversity than state-of-the-art approaches.
   Generating novel molecules that bind to specific protein targets is a challenging but important task in computational drug design. Zhang and colleagues present a molecular generation method based on hierarchical auto-regression.

AB Neural Style Transfer (NST) has been a widely researched topic as of late enabling new forms of image manipulation. Here we perform an extensive study on NST algorithms and extend the existing methods with custom modifications for application to Indian art styles. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of various methods ranging from the seminal work of Gatys et al which demonstrated the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in creating artistic imagery by separating and recombining image content and style, to the state of the art image-to-image translation models which use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the mapping between two domain of images. We observe and infer based on the results produced by the models on which one could be a more suitable approach for Indian art styles, especially Tanjore paintings which are unique compared to the Western art styles. We then propose the method which is more suitable for the domain of Indian Art style along with custom architecture which includes an enhancement and evaluation module. We then present evaluation methods, both qualitative and quantitative which includes our proposed metric, to evaluate the results produced by the model.

AB Event data consisting of time of occurrence of the events arises in several real-world applications. A commonly used framework to model such events is known as temporal point process, which is a stochastic process that predicts when the event will occur given the sequence of past events. Recent works have introduced neural network based point processes which outperformed statistical models such as Hawkes process and were shown to provide state-of-the-art performance in predicting event-times. However, neural point process models lack uncertainty quantification capability on predictions. A proper uncertainty quantification over event modeling will help in better decision-making for many practical and critical applications. In this work, we propose a novel and lightweight point process model, Bayesian Neural Hawkes process (BNHP) which leverages uncertainty modeling capability of Bayesian models and generalization capability of the neural networks to model event occurrence times. Additionally, we augment the model with spatio-temporal modeling capability where it can consider uncertainty over predicted time and location of the events. Experiments on several simulated and real-world datasets show that BNHP significantly improves prediction performance and uncertainty quantification for event prediction.

AB This paper proposes an algorithm based on a combination of DTW lower bound functions and Sakoe-Chiba constraints to improve the time efficiency of DTW distance measurement, which suffers from a high computational complexity and low efficiency while ensuring measurement accuracy. First, the Sakoe-Chiba-DTW algorithm is used to optimize the template and threshold in the original sequence. Then, different combinations of lower bound functions are introduced to filter out sequences that do not meet the similarity requirements compared to the optimized threshold, reducing the number of DTW calculations to improve efficiency. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 5 sets of self-built data samples for the detection and removal of interference signals caused by redundant objects. The results show that the algorithm achieves the same level of accuracy as traditional DTW algorithm, but saves up to 73880 s in detection time, greatly improving efficiency and having significant implications for data mining tasks.

AB Industrial fault detection has become more data-driven due to advancements in automated data analysis using deep learning. Such methods make it possible to extract useful features, e. g., from time series data retrieved from sensors, which is typically of complex nature. This allows for effective fault detection and prognostics that boost the efficiency and productivity of industrial equipment. This work explores the influence of a variety of architectural hyperparameters on the performance of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN). Using a multi-method approach, this paper focuses specifically on wide-kernel CNN models for industrial fault detection, that have proven to perform well for tasks such as classifying vibration signals retrieved from sensors. By varying hyperparameters such as the kernel size, stride and number of filters, an extensive hyperparameter space search was conducted; to identify optimal settings, we collected a total of 12,960 different combinations on three datasets into a model hyperparameter dataset, with their respective performance on the underlying fault detection task. Afterwards, this dataset was explored with follow-up analysis including statistical, feature, pattern and hyperparameter impact analysis. We find that although performance varies substantially depending on hyperparameter choices, there is no single simple strategy to optimise performance across the three datasets. However, an optimal setting in terms of performance can be found in the number of filters used in the later layers of the architecture for all datasets. Furthermore, hyperparameter importance differs across and within the datasets, and we found nonlinear relationships between hyperparameter settings and performance. Our analysis highlights key considerations when applying a wide-kernel CNN architecture to new data within the field of industrial fault detection. This supports practitioners who wish to apply and train state-of-the-art convolutional learning methods to apply to similar fault detection settings, e. g., vibration data arising from new combinations of sensors and/or machinery in the context of bearing faults.

TI Are LSTMs good few-shot learners?
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Meta-learning; Few-shot learning; Deep learning; Transfer learning
AB Deep learning requires large amounts of data to learn new tasks well, limiting its applicability to domains where such data is available. Meta-learning overcomes this limitation by learning how to learn. Hochreiter et al. (International conference on artificial neural networks, Springer, 2001) showed that an LSTM trained with backpropagation across different tasks is capable of meta-learning. Despite promising results of this approach on small problems, and more recently, also on reinforcement learning problems, the approach has received little attention in the supervised few-shot learning setting. We revisit this approach and test it on modern few-shot learning benchmarks. We find that LSTM, surprisingly, outperform the popular meta-learning technique MAML on a simple few-shot sine wave regression benchmark, but that LSTM, expectedly, fall short on more complex few-shot image classification benchmarks. We identify two potential causes and propose a new method called Outer Product LSTM (OP-LSTM) that resolves these issues and displays substantial performance gains over the plain LSTM. Compared to popular meta-learning baselines, OP-LSTM yields competitive performance on within-domain few-shot image classification, and performs better in cross-domain settings by 0.5-1.9% in accuracy score. While these results alone do not set a new state-of-the-art, the advances of OP-LSTM are orthogonal to other advances in the field of meta-learning, yield new insights in how LSTM work in image classification, allowing for a whole range of new research directions. For reproducibility purposes, we publish all our research code publicly.

DE Long-tailed visual recognition; Hierarchical block aggregation network;
   Decoupled training paradigm
AB It is usually supposed that training database is manually balanced in traditional visual recognition tasks. However, in nature, data tends to follow long-tailed distributions. In recent years, many plug-and-play methods based on data augmentation or representation learning have been proposed to tackle the long-tailed visual recognition task. Although these methods are effective, we find that when different plug-and-play methods are applied to the same long-tail recognition model, they sometimes fail to promote each other. The reason for this phenomenon may lie in the fact that the overall performance of the model is constrained by the insufficient capability of a traditional feature extractor. Motivated by this fact, we first propose Hierarchical Block Aggregation Network (HBAN), a network structure with stronger feature extraction capability. Then, we design a Quantity-Aware Balanced (QAB) loss and a decoupled training paradigm to optimize HBAN. The effectiveness of HBAN is demonstrated by extensive experiments. In particular, HBAN achieves significant improvements over our baseline on three benchmark datasets, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR 100-LT.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Code summary; Data augmentation; Clustering; Word replacement
AB Code comments improve the readability and intelligibility of codes, Unfortunately, code comments are often missing, or outdated in software projects, which negatively affects the efficiency of developers to infer the functionality from source code and affect the efficiency of software maintenance and evolution. To solve this problem, many source code summarization algorithms have been proposed, which automatically generate code comments from source code. However, these methods usually try to collect a large data set which contains the mapping between code comments and source code to train models. However, there are two limitations for the training sets: the insufficient data collection limitation (i.e., generate a large amount of noises-free training data) and data distribution bias limitation (i.e., generate training data for infrequently used methods). To address this issues, we have proposed a data augmentation method for code comments, named CDA-CS. Training models on the augmented dataset, the state-of the-art algorithms can easily get a further 1.37% to 2.24% improvement in terms of different evaluation metrics (i.e., BLUE-4, METEOR, ROUGH_L).& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized symptomatically by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors to separate its behavioral features. Despite extensive research efforts into the pathogenesis and neural substrates in OCD, the interactions and causal associations between the two behaviors remain unclear. To theoretically fill this gap in mechanisms, we combine a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic model of motor loops and a limbic system model based on classical reward prediction errors to model the complex dynamics between different loops in OCD. Based on the widely accepted hypothesis that dopamine bursts and reinforcement learning influence synaptic plasticity, we explore the mechanisms behind the progression of OCD related to stress triggers, overtraining, and striatal lesions, in terms of behavioral flexibility as a measurement. The obtained results indicate that reinforcement learning affects synaptic gain, which in turn influences loop stability and contributes to imbalance between loops. At the same time, it pulls the network into an over-stable state, similar to compulsive actions. Learning serves as the bridge between the limbic system (obsession) and the motor system (compulsion). Both systems work synergistically to facilitate the etiological transmission and progression of OCD. Our model provides plausible theoretical explanations for the behavioral features of OCD and may offer new approaches for its treatment.

AB Synchronization emerges ubiquitously in natural and engineering systems and at different scales. For real-world systems with invisible governing equations, recurrent neural networks provide effective approach to embed their dynamics from observations and facilitate intensive study, including the synchronization and its mechanisms. Synchronization at a scale of neural networks' dynamics instead of the component neurons' has seldom been studied. Here, we define the synchronization of reservoir computers at a macroscopic level, named by hyper-synchronization, from a viewpoint of dynamical systems theory. HyperSync is realized, with a merged attractor emerging, in reservoir computers trained by different chaotic systems through a proposed feedback coupling mechanism. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, and we further provide guidance for realizing synchronization among multiple reservoir computers coupled with different topologies. This work articulates an appealing framework to realize synchronization of neural networks and anticipates potential applications in fields such as communications and biological systems.

AB Real-world decision-making challenges tend to evolve into more intricate scenarios over time. In this context, the Fermatean fuzzy set emerges as an efficient and convenient framework, adept at illustrating the uncertainties inherent in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. To address decision-making challenges intertwined with uncertainties, the fundamental objective of this study is to develop a Fermatean fuzzy MCDM tool. This tool aims to expand users' scope to articulate their opinions and viewpoints. As a preliminary step, the study begins by elucidating the computation of the degree of proximity between the optimal alternative and its counterparts. This article presents the concept, representation, and pertinent characteristics of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (CC) within the context of Fermatean fuzzy sets. Subsequent to this, a multi-criteria decision-making technique, fortified by incorporating Fermatean fuzzy operators (FFOs), is formulated based on the proposed Spearman rank CC. Ultimately, we demonstrate the significance and efficacy of the introduced approach by showcasing its application in a real-world context, specifically within the domain of supplier selection decision-making. The results revealed that the primary advantage of the provided decision rule lies in its potential to effectively reduce production costs and streamline complexity within the context of supplier selection problems, both in theory and practical application. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in delivering reliable outcomes through a comprehensive analysis of FFOs and a comparative assessment against established techniques. A concrete case study is employed to firmly establish the stability and credibility of FFOs when combined with the Spearman rank CC. Additionally, this study carefully conducts a comprehensive comparative evaluation, comparing the previously developed methods with the newly proposed approach. This reinforces the robustness and authenticity of the FFO-based methodology and highlights its unique and practical nature.

DE Grammar Checkers; Yoruba; Government and Binding Theory
AB Grammar checkers have been developed for well-resourced languages such as French, German and English. However, there is a dearth of automatic grammar checkers for African languages including Standard Yoruba (SY) and consequently no standard software application. This study developed a software system for Yoruba grammar checking. Requirements for a Yoruba grammar checking system were investigated by gathering information on Yoruba syntax from Textbooks and Journals. Based on the information gathered, a computational model was formulated using the theoretical framework of Government and Binding (GB). The formulated system was designed using the Context Free Grammar Tool in Automata Theory. The system was implemented using the Python programming language version 3.5 and Natural Language Tool kit (NLTK). The system was tested for accuracy using a total of three hundred sentences. In detecting grammatically correct and incorrect sentences, an accuracy of 86.67%, 88.89% and 88.89% were achieved for simple, complex and compound sentences respectively. The grammar checker has been able to function as an automatic grammatical error checker of Yoruba digital text. Its implementation in software applications has the potential to increase the quality of Yorub ' a word processing. Also, the dictionary of words created can be used in other areas of human language processing.

AB This paper investigates the impact of Solid Volume Fraction (SVF) and temperature on the dynamic viscosity of a hybrid antifreeze composed of MWCNTs and aluminum oxide in a mixture of water (80%) and ethylene-glycol (20%). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to predict the viscosity of the nanofluid, which was generated at different SVFs ranging from 0.25% to 1% and temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C. This study aims to establish a correlation between viscosity and input parameters in the antifreeze. Results demonstrate that Shear Rate (SR) and SVF have opposite effects on the viscosity of the nanofluid. Increasing SVF leads to a strong increase in viscosity deviation and higher mean values of viscosity while increasing SR results in a sharp decline in both the mean value and variation of the viscosity. The temperature has a smaller impact on viscosity variance than SR and SVF. The proposed ANN model with a two-layer network and 13 neurons having nonlinear activation functions in the hidden layer shows an accurate prediction of viscosity versus inputs. The proposed methodology offers an improvement of up to 10 times in predicting viscosity accuracy as compared to GMDH and decision tree techniques. The findings of this study can have important implications for the design of heat exchangers using nanofluids especially in portable devices.

AB As a new intelligent optimization algorithm, the African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA) has been widely used in various fields today. However, when solving complex multimodal problems, the AVOA still has some shortcomings, such as low searching accuracy, deficiency on the search capability and tendency to fall into local optimum. In order to alleviate the main shortcomings of the AVOA, a nonlinear African vulture optimization algorithm combining Henon chaotic mapping theory and reverse learning competition strategy (HWEAVOA) is proposed. Firstly, the Henon chaotic mapping theory and elite population strategy are proposed to improve the randomness and diversity of the vulture's initial population; Furthermore, the nonlinear adaptive incremental inertial weight factor is introduced in the location update phase to rationally balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, and avoid individual falling into a local optimum; The reverse learning competition strategy is designed to expand the discovery fields for the optimal solution and strengthen the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. HWEAVOA and other advanced comparison algorithms are used to solve classical and CEC2022 test functions. Compared with other algorithms, the convergence curves of the HWEAVOA drop faster and the line bodies are smoother. These experimental results show the proposed HWEAVOA is ranked first in all test functions, which is superior to the comparison algorithms in convergence speed, optimization ability, and solution stability. Meanwhile, HWEAVOA has reached the general level in the algorithm complexity, and its overall performance is competitive in the swarm intelligence algorithms.

AB In the complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), the production bottleneck shifts in space as time goes on and constrains operational efficiency. Accurate proactive production bottleneck prediction provides a reliable basis for dynamic production decisions and helps to improve management timeliness and production efficiency. According to the production characteristics of DMS and the relationship between supply and demand, the production bottleneck is given a new quantification. A long and short-term memory network (LSTM) with dual attention mechanism and a dynamic updating method for the source model are proposed to predict production bottlenecks accurately. Firstly, feature and state attention mechanisms are designed to improve the feature extraction and prediction ability of LSTM. Secondly, as the applicability of the prediction model gradually declines over time, sliding time windows and fast Hoeffding concept detection are combined to trigger the update of model parameters. Then a competitive strategy is explored to choose the source model that is the most suitable for the current data distribution in the model library. Model-based transfer learning is adopted to update the source model parameters, making the prediction model highly adaptive. Subsequently, an elimination strategy is set to update the model library to ensure its timeliness. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in bottleneck prediction and superior to other methods.

AB Autonomous bridge visual inspection is a real-world challenge due to various materials, surface coatings, and changing light and weather conditions. Traditional supervised learning relies on massive annotated data to establish a robust model, which requires a time-consuming data acquisition process. This work proposes a fewshot learning (FSL) approach based on improved ProtoNet for damage detection with just a few labeled examples. Feature embedding is achieved through cross-domain transfer learning from ImageNet instead of episodic training. The ProtoNet is improved with embedding normalization to enhance transduction performance based on Euclidean distance and a linear classifier for classification. The approach is explored on a public dataset through different ablation experiments and achieves over 94% mean accuracy for 2-way 5-shot classification via the pre-trained GoogleNet after fine-tuning. Moreover, the proposed fine-tuning methods based on a fully connected layer (FCN) and Hadamard product are demonstrated with better performance than the previous method. Finally, the approach is validated using real bridge inspection images, demonstrating its capability of fast implementation for practical damage inspection with weakly supervised information.

AB This paper presents a novel few-shot proxy modeling approach for the oil and gas industry to reduce reliance on numerical simulators for reservoir analysis. The strategy introduces a regression framework leveraging deep hierarchical self-distillation to construct a meta-model based on ensemble learning. The proposed method employs a cascade training scheme, which uses predictions derived from a superior hierarchical level to distill knowledge into the next predictor. The pivotal idea of self-distillation is to generate "soft targets" rather than hard ones. Soft targets represent probability distributions over potential output curves rather than a correct answer. This smoothing information provides additional guidance to the model during training, helping it generalize better. This architecture utilizes three-dimensional (3D) maps in proxy modeling to forecast cumulative fluid production and generate risk curves indispensable for effective field decisions. The study employed data acquired from a complex oil field characterized by a substantial degree of uncertainty. The hierarchical self-distillation technique outperforms alternative methods, achieving a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) below 2%. It reduces computational overhead by 84% for a probabilistic model with 900 simulations and 62% for a model with 200 simulations. The developed proxy model delivers valuable insights for decision-making in oil field management, offering the potential to decrease expenses and enhance efficiency in field exploration endeavors.

AB Current research highlights the efficacy of decomposition and ensemble algorithms in enhancing forecasting accuracy; however, the investigation of robustness associated with decomposed components within these algorithms remains notably scarce in existing literature. To address this gap, we introduce a novel tourism demand forecasting framework, underpinned by a sophisticated decomposition algorithm. Our approach initially decomposes the original data into multiple sub-series and subsequently selects forecasting models based on their respective data attributes. We evaluated the proposed framework by forecasting monthly tourist arrivals in Hong Kong from six countries. The superiority of the novel decomposition method was further substantiated through comparisons with alternative decomposition techniques in both single-step and multi-step ahead forecasting contexts. The results indicate that the proposed forecasting framework consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of forecasting accuracy across all tourism demand forecasting scenarios, with the innovative decomposition method exhibiting exceptional performance.

AB Despite face frontalization developing rapidly, limited image pairs and low image quality are still obstacles to face frontalization. Although single-view-based face frontalization does not have the constraints of image pairs, it reduces the exploration of unknown data. We alleviate the face distortion problem based on single -view face frontalization from two aspects. One is that we designed a dual-mode face transformation model for model training based on the loss of facial features from different angles. These two training modes cope with the question of face frontalization in different distortions. Specifically, we apply the 3D head model to the data transformation by fitting the 2D image to the 3D model. Rotating the 3D model at the designed angle to realize the face transformation. We judge the distortion extent with Euler Angle and produce the two training modes corresponding to the dual-mode face transformation. On the other hand, we construct a perceptual loss module to preserve the detailed information of the front view. This module combines content and identity loss to generate the photorealistic frontal image. In qualitative and quantitative experiments, we conduct experiments to illustrate the advantages of the proposed model on controlled and field datasets. Further, we apply full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment methods to estimate the quality of images generated by different face frontalization models.

AB In recent years, object localization and detection methods in remote sensing images (RSIs) have received increasing attention due to their broad applications. However, most previous fully supervised methods require a large number of time-consuming and labor-intensive instance-level annotations. Compared with those fully supervised methods, weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to recognize object instances using only image-level labels, which greatly saves the labeling costs of RSIs. In this article, we propose a self-directed weakly supervised strategy (SD-WSS) to perform WSOL in RSIs. To specify, we fully exploit and enhance the spatial feature extraction capability of the RSIs' classification model to accurately localize the objects of interest. To alleviate the serious discriminative region problem exhibited by previous WSOL methods, the spatial location information implicit in the classification model is carefully extracted by GradCAM $++$ to guide the learning procedure. Furthermore, to eliminate the interference from complex backgrounds of RSIs, we design a novel self-directed loss to make the model optimize itself and explicitly tell it where to look. Finally, we review and annotate the existing remote sensing scene classification dataset and create two new WSOL benchmarks in RSIs, named C45V2 and PN2. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method and six mainstream WSOL methods with three backbones on C45V2 and PN2. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance when compared with state-of-the-arts.

ID ENSEMBLE
AB Consensus clustering is to find a high quality and robust partition that is in agreement with multiple existing base clusterings. However, its computational cost is often very expensive and the quality of the final clustering is easily affected by uncertain consensus relations between clusters. In order to solve these problems, we develop a new k-type algorithm, called k-relations-based consensus clustering with double entropy-norm regularizers (KRCC-DE). In this algorithm, we build an optimization model to learn a consensus-relation matrix between final and base clusters and employ double entropy-norm regularizers to control the distribution of these consensus relations, which can reduce the impact of the uncertain consensus relations. The proposed algorithm uses an iterative strategy with strict updating formulas to get the optimal solution. Since its computation complexity is linear with the number of objects, base clusters, or final clusters, it can take low computational costs to effectively solve the consensus clustering problem. In experimental analysis, we compared the proposed algorithm with other k-type-based and global-search consensus clustering algorithms on benchmark datasets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can balance the quality of the final clustering and its computational cost well.

TI Node Importance Estimation with Multiview Contrastive Representation

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Node importance estimation is a fundamental task in graph analysis, which can be applied to various downstream applications such as recommendation and resource allocation. However, existing studies merely work under a single view, which neglects the rich information hidden in other aspects of the graph. Hence, in this work, we propose a Multiview Contrastive Representation Learning (MCRL) model to obtain representations of nodes from multiple perspectives and then infer the node importance. Specifically, we are the first to apply the contrastive learning technique to the node importance analysis task, which enhances the expressiveness of graph representations and lays the foundation for importance estimation. Moreover, based on the improved representations, we generate the entity importance score by attentively aggregating the scores from two different views, i.e., node view and node-edge interaction view. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that MCRL outperforms existing methods on all evaluation metrics.

AB Natural language generation (NLG) models have attracted extensive attention and applications due to their combination with powerful deep learning techniques. Many NLG models are encapsulated in cloud APIs serving commercial organizations, which have become very important profitable services for these institutions. However, cloud platforms may suffer from model extraction attacks that aim to imitate the functionality of these NLG models in practical applications, thus infringing the intellectual property (IP) of the NLG APIs. Unfortunately, most current watermarking methods for protecting deep model IP are not directly applicable to IP protection of NLG APIs. In addition, the semantic similarity between the watermarked texts generated by the baseline method and the original texts is not high enough, which can be easily detected by attackers. To make up these gaps, we propose a novel watermarking framework which embeds watermarks by conducting lexical modification to the outputs of the NLG models, and uses the corresponding watermark identification method can identify the attackers and protect the IP of NLG APIs. Experiment result shows that our proposed watermarking method not only generates watermarked texts with higher semantically similar to the original texts but also achieves better identifiable performance compared with the baseline method. In addition, our watermarking method also exhibits outstanding performance in other aspects such as transferability, watermark undetectability and robustness.

AB Word spotting in handwritten documents is challenging due to the high intra-class and inter-class variability of handwritten forms. This paper addresses the word spotting problem in the segmentation and the training scenarios. Overall, this paper makes the following three contributions: (1) a new word text representation, called the Pyramid of Bidirectional Character Sequences (PBCS), which can solve both the word spotting problem and the word recognition problem. The use of the PBCS representation allows trained models to identify the character subsequences shared by words. Thus, words that are not seen during training can be represented and spotted. In addition, the PBCS representation encodes word texts redundantly, allowing for word discrimination. (2) A binary classification modeling of the word spotting problem in the difference space between representations, where spotting of non-vocabulary words is more efficient. Finally, (3) a new deep neural network architecture that combines the strengths of convolutional layers and transformers. We evaluated our solution on IAM and RIEMS datasets and showed that it outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in the query-by-example scenario.

AB Learning probabilistic models that can estimate the density of a given set of samples, and generate samples from that density, is one of the fundamental challenges in unsupervised machine learning. We introduce a new generative model based on denoising density estimators (DDEs), which are scalar functions parametrized by neural networks, that are efficiently trained to represent kernel density estimators of the data. Leveraging DDEs, our main contribution is a novel technique to obtain generative models by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence directly. We prove that our algorithm for obtaining generative models is guaranteed to converge consistently to the correct solution. Our approach does not require specific network architecture as in normalizing flows (NFs), nor use ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers as in continuous NFs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvement in density estimation and competitive performance in generative model training.

AB Although many deep learning models-based medical applications are performance-driven, i.e., accuracy oriented, their explainability is more critical. This is especially the case with neuroimaging, where we are often interested in identifying biomarkers underlying brain development or disorders. Herein we propose an explainable deep learning approach by elucidating the information transmission mechanism between two layers of a deep network with a joint feature selection strategy that considers several shallow-layer explainable machine learning models and sparse learning of the deep network. At the end, we apply and validate the proposed approach to the analysis of dynamic brain functional connectivity (FC) from fMRI in a brain development study. Our approach can identify the differences within and between functional brain networks over age during development. The results indicate that the brain network transits from undifferentiated structures to more specialized and organized ones, and the information processing ability becomes more efficient as age increases. In addition, we detect two developmental patterns in the brain network: the FCs in regions related to visual and sound processing and mental regulation become weakened, while those between regions corresponding to emotional processing and cognitive activities are enhanced.

AB Collaboratively leveraging limited pixel-level segmentation annotations and large-scale slide-level classification labels in hybrid supervision learning can significantly enhance model performance. However, the direct application of this approach within computational pathology presents challenges as end-to-end classification models grapple with processing high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs). An alternative approach is to use patch-based models with pixel-level pseudo-labels, but these models can be susceptible to the cumulative effects of noisy labels, leading to convergence and drift problems during iterative training. To surmount these hurdles, we propose a hybrid supervision learning framework tailored for pathological image classification. Our method employs coarse classification labels to optimize pixel-level pseudo-labels and incorporates a comprehensive strategy to diminish false negatives and positives throughout the segmentation process. This framework holistically integrates the supervised information derived from segmentation and classification procedures, and is applicable to the general classification of high-resolution images, thereby boosting both specificity and sensitivity. We assess our proposed method's effectiveness using one publicly accessible dataset and two proprietary datasets, collectively constituting over 10,000 pathological images of various disease types such as gastric, cervical, and breast cancer. Our experimental results reveal a 100% sensitivity rate in slide-level classification tasks, simultaneously reducing the false-positive rate to a mere third of the state-of-the-art. In conclusion, this paper presents a potent instrument for the precise and efficient classification of high-resolution pathological images, with promising results showcased across a wide array of datasets and disease types.

AB Directly mining high-dimensional time series presents several challenges, such as time and space costs. This study proposes a new approach for representing time series data and evaluates its effectiveness in detecting collective anomalies. The proposed method, called bidirectional piecewise linear representation (BPLR), represents the original time series using a set of linear fitting functions, which allows for dimensionality reduction while maintaining its dynamic characteristics. Similarity measurement is then performed using the piecewise integration (PI) approach, which achieves good detection performance with low computational overhead. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach. The ability of the proposed method to capture more dynamic details of time series leads to consistently superior performance compared to other existing methods.

AB Bayesian information gain (BIG) framework-based information exploration studies have generally focused on explicit interactions, such as user browsing via keyboard and mouse. However, if implicit information, such as eye-gaze data, is implemented in the BIG framework alongside explicit interactions, the system can accurately respond and proactively provide target information to the user. We, therefore, propose the BIGaze system, which uses real-time eye-gaze data to predict and recommend target information by analyzing the browsing and gazing action patterns corresponding to information searched by the user. To validate the performance of the proposed system within the information exploration process, we performed comparative user experiments with BIGaze, BIGbase (a BIG system without gaze data), and a non-BIG system. The experimental results reveal that BIGaze proactively captures user exploration targets, confidently generates user-intended recommendations, and assists a wide range of user exploration patterns.

ID TRACKING
AB Surgical instrument segmentation plays a crucial role in robot-assisted surgery by furnishing essential information about instrument location and orientation. This information not only enhances surgical planning but also augments the precision and safety of procedures. Despite promising strides in recent research on surgical instrument segmentation, accuracy still faces obstacles due to local feature processing limitations, surgical environment complexity, and instrument morphological variability. To address these challenges, we introduced the channel-wise features fusion and recalibration network (CFFR-Net). This network utilizes a dual-stream mechanism, combining a context-guided block and dense block for feature extraction. The context-guided block captures a variety of contextual information by using different dilation rates. Additionally, CFFR-Net employs a fusion mechanism that harmonizes context-guided and dense streams. This integration, along with the inclusion of Squeeze-and-Excitation attention, enhances both the precision and robustness of semantic instrument segmentation.We performed experiments using two publicly available datasets for surgical instrument segmentation: the Kvasir-instrument and Endovis2017 datasets. The results of these experiments were highly encouraging, as our proposed model exhibited remarkable performance on both datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. On the Kvasir-instrument set, our model achieved a Dice score of 95.84% and mean intersection over union (mIOU) value of 92.40%. Similarly, on the Endovis2017 set, it obtained a Dice score of 95.47% and mIOU value of 93.02%.

AB Although recent studies have proposed seizure detection algorithms with good sensitivity performance, there is a remained challenge that they were hard to achieve significantly short detection latency in real-time scenarios. In this manuscript, we propose a novel deep learning framework intended for shortening epileptic seizure detection latency via probabilistic prediction. We are the first to convert the seizure detection task from traditional binary classification to probabilistic prediction by introducing a crossing period from seizure -oriented EEG recording and proposing a labeling rule using soft-label for crossing period samples. And, a novel multiscale STFT-based feature extraction method combined with 3D-CNN architecture is proposed to accurately capture predictive probabilities of samples. Furthermore, we also propose rectified weighting strategy to enhance predictive probabilities, and accumulative decision-making rule to achieve significantly shorter detection latency. We implement the proposed framework on two prevalent datasets - CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset and SWEC-ETHZ intracranial EEG dataset in patient-specific leave-one-seizure-out cross-validation scheme. Eventually, the proposed algorithm successfully detected 94 out of 99 seizures during crossing period and 100% seizures detected after EEG onset, averaged 14.84% rectified predictive ictal probability (RPIP) errors of crossing samples, 2.3 s detection latency, 0.08/h false detection rate (FDR) on CHB-MIT dataset. Meanwhile, 84 out of 89 detected seizures during crossing period, 100% detected seizures after EEG onset, 16.17% RPIP errors, 4.7 s detection latency, and 0.08/h FDR are achieved on SWEC-ETHZ dataset. The obtained detection latencies are at least 50% shorter than state-of-the-art results reported in previous studies.

AB In recent years, sensor components similar to human sensory functions have been rapidly developed in the hardware field, enabling the acquisition of information at a level beyond that of humans, and in the software field, artificial intelligence technology has been utilized to enable cognitive abilities and decision-making such as prediction, analysis, and judgment. These changes are being utilized in various industries and fields. In particular, new hardware and software technologies are being rapidly applied to robotics products, showing a level of performance and completeness that was previously unimaginable. In this paper, we researched the topic of establishing an optimal path plan for autonomous driving using LiDAR sensors and deep reinforcement learning in a workplace without map and grid coordinates for mobile robots, which are widely used in logistics and manufacturing sites. For this purpose, we reviewed the hardware configuration of mobile robots capable of autonomous driving, checked the characteristics of the main core sensors, and investigated the core technologies of autonomous driving. In addition, we reviewed the appropriate deep reinforcement learning algorithm to realize the autonomous driving of mobile robots, defined a deep neural network for autonomous driving data conversion, and defined a reward function for path planning. The contents investigated in this paper were built into a simulation environment to verify the autonomous path planning through experiment, and an additional reward technique "Velocity Range-based Evaluation Method" was proposed for further improvement of performance indicators required in the real field, and the effectiveness was verified. The simulation environment and detailed results of experiments are described in this paper, and it is expected as guidance and reference research for applying these technologies in the field.

AB Hypersphere Guided Embedding for Masked Face Recognition has been proposed to address the problem encountered in the Masked Face Recognition task, which arises due to non-biological information from occlusions. While some existing algorithms prefer to digesting the existence of masks by probing and covering, others aim to integrate face recognition and masked face recognition tasks into a unified solution domain. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable existing methods to accommodate multiple data distributions by orthogonal subspaces. Specifically, We introduce constraints on multiple hypersphere manifolds via Multi -Center Loss and employ a Spatial Split Strategy to ensure the orthogonality of base vectors associated with different hypersphere manifolds, corresponding to distinct distribution. Our method is extensively evaluated on publicly available datasets on face recognition, mask face recognition and occlusion, demonstrating promising performance.

AB Vibrational spectroscopy techniques enable accurate chemical detection and quantification, but the extraction of spectral peak parameters is frequently hampered by an underlying baseline. Because the signal and baseline are additive, it is difficult to distinguish between signal peaks and baseline effects when the baseline is not smooth. Using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as examples, we show how to estimate the signal and the baseline jointly while imposing a high-capacity non-stationary Gaussian process on the baseline. This allows us to both obtain accurate estimation and meaningful uncertainty estimates on interpretable peak parameters. We demonstrate this on artificially generated SERS maps, a challenging real-world SERS case, and a benchmark NIR dataset.

LA English
DT Article
DE Compositional zero shot; Knowledge sharing; State-object composition;
   Feasibility assessment; Graph convolution
AB The purpose of the Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is to recognize new state-object compositions of known objects and known states. For example, the CZSL model should recognize young cat when the model has seen images of a few state-object compositions like young tiger, old tiger and old cat. The visual features of a state may have significant variation across different compositions of the state with different objects. For example, in the compositions peeled apple and peeled orange, the state peeled has different visual features. This context dependency of state features is difficult to learn from the annotated images of different compositions. We propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with two distinct branches for object and state recognition. GCN utilizes its ability to aggregate features from the non-Euclidean neighbourhood. This aggregation ability of GCN can help our model to capture the intricate dependencies between visual features of state and object. We also propose a novel cross-layer knowledge sharing strategy for the purpose of reducing ambiguity in learning state features due to context dependency. The proposed cross-layer knowledge sharing helps in identifying a set of objects having feasible compositions with a particular state and thereby reducing the ambiguity in the state features. Finally, we propose a feasibility based penalization to better regularize the joint prediction from the two branches of the network. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the challenging benchmarks and competitive results in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms have been achieved.

DT Article
DE Unsupervised optical flow estimation; Involution; Feature interaction;
   Self-attention; Deformable convolution
AB The convolution neural network is still the main tool for extracting the image features and the motion features for most of the optical flow models. The convolution neural networks cannot model the long-range dependencies, and more details are lost in deeper layers. All the deficiencies in the extracted features affect the estimated flow. Therefore, in this work, we concentrated on optimizing the convolution neural network in both the encoder and decoder parts to improve the image and motion features. To enhance the image features, we utilize the involution to provide rich features and model the long-range dependencies. In addition, we propose a Multi-Scale-Interaction module which utilizes the self-attention to make an interaction between the feature scales to avoid detail loss. Additionally, we propose a Motion-Features-Optimization block that utilizes the deformable convolution to enhance the motion features. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.

AB Several methods have already been proposed to automatically design control software for robot swarms by assembling predefined modules. Yet, so far, the modules on which these methods operate have always been defined manually in a process that is time consuming, requires domain knowledge, and must be performed by an expert. Motivated by the goal of automatizing the definition of these modules, we propose an approach in which repertoires of modules, in the form of neural networks, are automatically generated via a quality diversity evolutionary algorithm. To illustrate the proposal, we introduce Nata, a novel approach belonging to the AutoMoDe family. Nata automatically generates probabilistic finite-state machines in which states are selected from a repertoire of neural networks, and transition conditions are selected from a set of rules based on the sensory capabilities of the robotic platform considered. Both the repertoire of neural networks and the set of transition rules are automatically generated a priori, once and for all, in a mission-agnostic way. We study Nata on three missions, both in simulation and with real robots. Nata is the first modular automatic design method that assembles modules that were themselves generated automatically.

AB In many chemical reactors, concentration measurements are conducted off-line in a laboratory, which involve manual work and can therefore be conducted only infrequently. We propose a Bayesian inferential sensor to predict the reactant concentration in the inlet stream of an exothermic chemical process. The inferential sensor is based on the Bayesian inverse approach and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. It enables the prediction of the reactant concentration at the frequency of automated on-line measurements, which is typically much higher than that of laboratory measurements. We demonstrate the method on real industrial process data from catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic compounds. The predicted aromatics concentration in the inlet stream, generated based on the latest on-line measurements and two-week-old laboratory data, has a coefficient of determination of 0.936 and a root mean square error of 0.654 mass-%.

ID FEATURES
AB Despite significant amount of work reported in the computer vision literature, segmenting images or videos based on multiple cues such as objectness, texture and motion, is still a challenge. This is particularly true when the number of objects to be segmented is not known or there are objects that are not classified in the training data (unknown objects). A possible remedy to this problem is to utilize graph-based clustering techniques such as Correlation Clustering. It is known that using long range affinities (Lifted multicut), makes correlation clustering more accurate than using only adjacent affinities (Multicut). However, the former is computationally expensive and hard to use. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to perform image/motion segmentation using an affinity learning module and a Message Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN). The affinity learning module uses a permutation invariant affinity representation to overcome the multi-object problem. The paper shows, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed MPGNN aggregates higher order information and thereby converts the Lifted Multicut Problem (LMP) to a Multicut Problem (MP), which is easier and faster to solve. Importantly, the proposed method can be generalized to deal with different clustering problems with the same MPGNN architecture. For instance, our method produces competitive results for single image segmentation (on BSDS dataset) as well as unsupervised video object segmentation (on DAVIS17 dataset), by only changing the feature extraction part. In addition, using an ablation study on the proposed MPGNN architecture, we show that the way we update the parameterized affinities directly contributes to the accuracy of the results.

AB In this article, a double strategy is proposed to find the optimal gains of a cascaded PI controller to minimize the trajectory position error in a five-bar parallel robot. The first strategy employs Differential Evolution to tune constant gains during the execution time of the desired trajectory. Once Differential Evolution achieves convergence on the solution by finding the vector of optimal gains that minimize the position tracking error, all the position error data and current of the two brushless motors are saved. In the second strategy, the data generated in the first strategy is used to train a Deep Neural Network. After that, the trained Deep Neural Network replaces the constant gains of the first strategy with time-varying gains for the desired trajectory. Three working scenarios are proposed to test the generalization of the Deep Neural Network. In the first scenario, a training trajectory is executed. In the second one, a testing trajectory of the Deep Neural Network is evaluated. In the third one, a mass change is generated in the middle of the cycle. The results show that the Deep Neural Network is robust to different trajectories and mass changes during the execution of pick and place tasks.

AB Dense and complex air traffic requires higher levels of automation than those exhibited by tactical conflict detection and resolution (CD & R) tools that air traffic controllers (ATCOs) use today: AI tools can act on their own initiative, increasing the capacity of ATCOs to control higher volumes of traffic. However, given that the air traffic control (ATC) domain is safety critical, requires AI systems to which ATCOs are comfortable to relinquishing control, guaranteeing operational integrity and automation adoption. Two major factors towards this goal are quality of solutions and operational transparency. ResoLver, the system that this article presents, addresses these challenges using an enhanced graph convolutional reinforcement learning method operating in a multiagent setting where each agent - representing a flight - performs a CD & R task, jointly with other agents. We show that ResoLver can provide high-quality solutions with respect to stakeholders interests (air traffic controllers and airspace users), addressing also operational transparency issues, which have been validated by ATCOs in simulated real-world settings.

AB Training deep learning models on long-tailed datasets is a challenging task since the classification performance of tail classes with fewer samples is always unsatisfactory. Currently, many long-tailed methods have achieved success. However, some methods always improve tail-class performance at the expense of head class performance due to limited model capability. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm-level method inspired by information theory to balance the information space of each class and boost tail-class performance while minimizing head-class sacrifice. Our method involves actively eliminating the redundant feature information of head classes to save space for tail classes during training. Specifically, we use a bilateral expert model and design a duplicate information disentanglement (DID) module that can extract duplicate and redundant information from bilateral-expert features. This allows us to develop a head diversity loss to decrease the extracted duplicate and redundant information of head classes and a tail distillation loss to increase the label information of tail classes. The joint result of these two losses allows our model to fully leverage the information space for improved tail-class performance without compromising head-class performance. The effectiveness and practicability of our method are verified by five datasets with long-tailed distributions for visual recognition or fault diagnosis tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms currently available mainstream methods, which we attribute to the effectiveness of our proposed DID module and the incorporation of two long-tailed losses.

AB When the source domain has more fault types than the target domain, the traditional domain adaptation (DA) performance will degrade. Therefore, exploring partial domain adaptation to improve the accuracy of crossdomain fault diagnosis is significant. This work develops a novel adaptive manifold partial domain adaptation (AMPDA) approach for implementing the partial transfer fault diagnosis by decreasing the distribution discrepancy and adaptively learning global geometrical structures. Specifically, AMPDA first proposes the extraction method of the global geometrical structure by an affinity matrix. Then, the two domains are aligned by decreasing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between two classes. AMPDA applies the manifold regularization to the objective function of partial domain adaptation, adaptively changing the weight of the geometrical structure according to the feature mapping within the process aligning two domains. AMPDA can adaptively learn the global geometrical structure to reduce the man-made interference in the K-nearest neighbor and restrain negative transfer learning caused by forcing to keep the structure. AMPDA is successfully applied to partial transfer fault diagnosis of rolling bearings and planetary gearboxes with unlabeled target domain samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the AMPDA performs better than typical DA methods based on machine learning.

TI FMAP: Learning robust and accurate local feature matching with anchor
   points
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Local feature matching; Anchor points; Transformer
AB Local feature matching involves the task of establishing the pixel-wise correspondences between a pair of images. As an integral component of plentiful computer vision applications (e.g., visual localization), this task has been successfully performed using Transformer-based methods. However, these methods typically extract numerous keypoints from sparse texture regions to construct a densely-connected graph neural network (GNN) for long-range feature aggregation, which inevitably triggers redundant message exchange and hampers the learning process. Furthermore, they employ transformer encoder layers that consider images as 1D sequences, leaving them incapable of extracting multiscale local structural information from the images, which is critical for establishing correspondence in image pairs with significantly scales shifts. In this study, we develop FMAP, an innovative detector-free approach that enables accurate local feature matching. For the first issue, FMAP employs an anchor points feature aggregation module (APAM) that captures representative keypoints and discards the extraneous keypoints to build a sparsified GNN for compact yet clean message exchange, with the key insight that the keypoints containing abundant visual information are distinguishable from their neighbors. For the second issue, FMAP proposes a global-local multiscale perception module (GMPM), which incorporates abundant multiscale local context information into global feature representation by employing multiple depth-wise convolutions with varying kernel sizes, thereby generating discriminative features that are robust to scale shifts. In addition, the depth-wise convolutions are utilized in the feed-forward network of the GMPM to further fuse the global context information and local feature representation. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed FMAP method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Compared to the cutting-edge methods MatchFormer, QuadTree, and TopicFM in relative pose estimation task, FMAP surpasses them by 2.27%, 0.58%, and 1.08% in terms of AUC@5 degrees. Besides, FMAP noticeably outperforms the baseline LoFTR by (2.38%, 1.89%, 1.45%) in terms of AUC@(5 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees). Moreover, we integrate FMAP into an official visual localization framework and conduct a visual localization experiment, with the results showing that FMAP exceeds LoFTR by 2.3% in terms of AP.

ID PAIN INTENSITY ESTIMATION; AUTOMATIC DEPRESSION RECOGNITION; APPEARANCE
AB Video-based analysis of facial expressions has been increasingly applied to infer health states of individuals, such as depression and pain. Among the existing approaches, deep learning models composed of structures for multiscale spatiotemporal processing have shown strong potential for encoding facial dynamics. However, such models have high computational complexity, making for a difficult deployment of these solutions. To address this issue, we introduce a new technique to decompose the extraction of multiscale spatiotemporal features. Particularly, a building block structure called Decomposed Multiscale Spatiotemporal Network (DMSN) is presented along with three variants: DMSN-A, DMSN-B, and DMSN-C blocks. The DMSN-A block generates multiscale representations by analyzing spatiotemporal features at multiple temporal ranges, while the DMSN-B block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple ranges, and the DMSN-C block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple spatial sizes. Using these variants, we design our DMSN architecture which has the ability to explore a variety of multiscale spatiotemporal features, favoring the adaptation to different facial behaviors. Our extensive experiments on challenging datasets show that the DMSN-C block is effective for depression detection, whereas the DMSN-A block is efficient for pain estimation. Results also indicate that our DMSN architecture achieves competitive performance while requiring 3.51x and 26.55x fewer parameters than the current state-of-the-art models for depression detection and pain estimation, respectively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wheidima/DMSN.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) is a key component of mobile and ubiquitous computing. With the increasing number of sensors embedded in devices such as smartphones and smartwatches, models are enhanced to recognize more complex human behaviors. However, this also leads to increased data heterogeneity, caused by diverse user backgrounds, health conditions, and sensing environments, which makes it difficult to align the multimodal data distributions across individuals. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework via Adversarial Time Frequency Attention (ATFA) to efficiently adapt models to new users. In particular, the proposed attention-based modality fusion module captures and fuses important modalities based on their context to reduce redundant information. Additionally, the network explores frequency domain features to improve performance in recognizing human activities. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available HAR datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Outlier detection plays an important role in data mining because it can improve the performance of data analysis. Most outlier detection algorithms focus on numerical or categorical attributes; however, data typically have a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes. We addressed this problem by developing an attribute-weighted outlier detection algorithm, PMIOD, for high-dimensional and massive mixed data. The PMIOD algorithm adopts mutual information to measure attribute correlations and provides an attribute-weighting method for mixed data. Based on this, an attribute-weighted outlier detection method for mixed data was developed. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of mutual information computing for high-dimensional mixed data, the mutual information computing was parallelized on the Spark platform. We evaluated the proposed algorithm using ten UCI datasets and four synthetic datasets in comparison with widely used algorithms. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the results produced by the proposed algorithm.

DE Weak supervision; Transformer network; Self -attention
AB A dense crowd counting method based on self-attention mechanism with dual-branch fusion network is proposed in this paper. Our method aims to address the problems of large variations in head scales and complex backgrounds in dense crowd images. This method combines the CNN and Transformer network frameworks and consists of shallow feature extraction network, dual-branch fusion network, and deep feature extraction network. The VGG16 network is employed by the shallow feature extraction network to extract low-level features. A multi-scale CNN branch and a Transformer branch built on an improved self-attention module make up the dual-branch fusion network, which collects local and global information on crowd areas, respectively. The Transformer network, which is based on a mixed attention module, is employed by the deep feature extraction network to further separate complicated backgrounds and concentrate on crowd areas. Both counting-level weakly supervised and location-level fully supervised methods are employed in the experiments. On four widely used datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the most recent research. Our method has a higher counting accuracy with low parameter volumes and a counting accuracy of 89.1% under full supervision when compared to existing weakly supervised methods. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the method has excellent crowd counting performance and can accurately count in high-density and high-occlusion scenes.

Under the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) technology, a self-learning model-free method by integrating zero-sum game and singular perturbation (SP) theories is proposed in this paper, such that composite controllers with signal compensation can be found under which the suboptimal operation of the whole process can be achieved using only measured data. The remarkable highlight in this paper is the novel design method of the composite controllers with signal compensations for unknown nonlinear systems with multi-rate operations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a practical example and a numerical example.

AB Despite the rapid advance in multispectral (MS) pansharpening, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods require training on separate CNNs for different satellite datasets. However, such a single-task learning (STL) paradigm often leads to overlooking any underlying correlations between datasets. Aiming at this challenging problem, a multitask network (MTNet) is presented to accomplish joint MS pansharpening in a unified framework for images acquired by different satellites. Particularly, the pansharpening process of each satellite is treated as a specific task, while MTNet simultaneously learns from all data obtained from these satellites following the multitask learning (MTL) paradigm. MTNet shares the generic knowledge between datasets via task-agnostic subnetwork (TASNet), utilizing task-specific subnetworks (TSSNets) to facilitate the adaptation of such knowledge to a certain satellite. To tackle the limitation of the local connectivity property of the CNN, TASNet incorporates Transformer modules to derive global information. In addition, band-aware dynamic convolutions (BDConvs) are proposed that can accommodate various ground scenes and bands by adjusting their respective receptive field (RF) size. Systematic experimental results over different datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.

AB The rapid advancement of industrialization has sparked the emergence of diverse art and design theories. As a trailblazer in the realm of industrial art and design theory, visual communication has transcended the boundaries of merely arranging and combining individual elements. Embracing the potential of artificial intelligence technology, the extraction of multidimensional abstract data and the acceleration of the art design process have gained considerable momentum. This study delves into the abstract emotional facets within the methodology of visual communication art design. Initially, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are employed to extract expressive features from the poster's visual information. Subsequently, these features are utilized to cluster emotional elements using a variational autoencoder (VAE). Through this clustering process, the poster images are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral classes. Experimental results demonstrate a silhouette coefficient surpassing 0.7, while the system framework exhibits clustering accuracy and efficiency exceeding 80% in single sentiment class testing. These outcomes underscore the efficacy of the proposed CNN-VAE-based clustering framework in analyzing the dynamic content of design elements. This framework presents a novel approach for future art design within the realm of visual communication.

AB A novel hierarchical control framework combining computed-torque-like control (CTLC) with disturbance-observer-based event-triggered robust model predictive control (DO-ET-RMPC) is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of robotic manipulators with bounded disturbances and state and control input constraints. The CTLC approach is first used to cancel the exact nonlinear dynamics of the original tracking error system to obtain a set of decoupling linear tracking error subsystems, thus reducing the optimization complexity of model predictive control (MPC). The composite DO-ET-RMPC scheme is then developed based on the so-called dual-mode MPC approach to robustly stabilize the tracking error subsystems, which could improve the robustness of MPC and save its computational resources simultaneously. The continuous-time theoretical properties of the DO-ET-RMPC scheme, considering disturbances and state and control input constraints simultaneously, are provided for the first time, including the avoidance of Zeno behavior, robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and stability. In the end, the superiorities of the proposed control scheme are verified by the comparative simulations.

ID TRADING STRATEGY; SELECTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB Portfolio analysis is a crucial subject within modern finance. However, the classical Markowitz model, which was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991, faces new challenges in contemporary financial environments. Specifically, it fails to consider transaction costs and cardinality constraints, which have become increasingly critical factors, particularly in the era of high-frequency trading. To address these limitations, this research is motivated by the successful application of machine learning tools in various engineering disciplines. In this work, three novel dynamic neural networks are proposed to tackle nonconvex portfolio optimization under the presence of transaction costs and cardinality constraints. The neural dynamics are intentionally designed to exploit the structural characteristics of the problem, and the proposed models are rigorously proven to achieve global convergence. To validate their effectiveness, experimental analysis is conducted using real stock market data of companies listed in the Dow Jones Index (DJI), covering the period from November 8, 2021 to November 8, 2022, encompassing an entire year. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. Notably, the proposed model achieves a substantial reduction in costs (which combines investment risk and reward) by as much as 56.71% compared with portfolios that are averagely selected.

DT Article; Early Access

   learning (RL); variational information flow
AB Communication-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promising results in promoting cooperation by enabling agents to exchange information. However, the existing methods have limitations in large-scale multiagent systems due to high information redundancy, and they tend to overlook the unstable training process caused by the online-trained communication protocol. In this work, we propose a novel method called neighboring variational information flow (NVIF), which enhances communication among neighboring agents by providing them with the maximum information set (MIS) containing more information than the existing methods. NVIF compresses the MIS into a compact latent state while adopting neighboring communication. To stabilize the overall training process, we introduce a two-stage training mechanism. We first pretrain the NVIF module using a randomly sampled offline dataset to create a task-agnostic and stable communication protocol, and then use the pretrained protocol to perform online policy training with RL algorithms. Our theoretical analysis indicates that NVIF-proximal policy optimization (PPO), which combines NVIF with PPO, has the potential to promote cooperation with agent-specific rewards. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both heterogeneous and homogeneous settings. Additional experiment results also demonstrate the potential of our method for multitask learning.

AB In this article, the optimized distributed filtering problem is studied for a class of saturated systems with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays via a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). The AF relays are located in the channels between sensors and filters to prolong the transmission distance of signals, where the transmission powers of sensors and relays can be described by a sequence of random variables with a known probability distribution. With the purpose of alleviating the communication burden and preventing data collision, the DETM is used to schedule the transmission cases of nodes by dynamically adjusting the triggered threshold according to the practical requirements. An upper bound matrix (UBM) of the filtering error (FE) covariance is first provided under the sense of variance constraint and the proper filter gain is further constructed via minimizing the proposed UBM. In addition, the boundedness evaluation regarding the trace of the UBM is provided. Finally, simulation experiments are used to illustrate the usefulness of the developed distributed recursive filtering scheme.

ID SELF-REPRESENTATION
AB Learning a comprehensive representation from multiview data is crucial in many real-world applications. Multiview representation learning (MRL) based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely adopted by projecting high-dimensional space into a lower order dimensional space with great interpretability. However, most prior NMF-based MRL techniques are shallow models that ignore hierarchical information. Although deep matrix factorization (DMF)-based methods have been proposed recently, most of them only focus on the consistency of multiple views and have cumbersome clustering steps. To address the above issues, in this article, we propose a novel model termed deep autoencoder-like NMF for MRL (DANMF-MRL), which obtains the representation matrix through the deep encoding stage and decodes it back to the original data. In this way, through a DANMF-based framework, we can simultaneously consider the multiview consistency and complementarity, allowing for a more comprehensive representation. We further propose a one-step DANMF-MRL, which learns the latent representation and final clustering labels matrix in a unified framework. In this approach, the two steps can negotiate with each other to fully exploit the latent clustering structure, avoid previous tedious clustering steps, and achieve optimal clustering performance. Furthermore, two efficient iterative optimization algorithms are developed to solve the proposed models both with theoretical convergence analysis. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approaches against other state-of-the-art MRL methods.

AB Recent studies have focused on using natural language (NL) to automatically retrieve useful data from database (DB) systems. As an important component of autonomous DB systems, the NL-to-SQL technique can assist DB administrators in writing high-quality SQL statements and make persons with no SQL background knowledge learn complex SQL languages. However, existing studies cannot deal with the issue that the expression of NL inevitably mismatches the implementation details of SQLs, and the large number of out-of-domain (OOD) words makes it difficult to predict table columns. In particular, it is difficult to accurately convert NL into SQL in an end-to-end fashion. Intuitively, it facilitates the model to understand the relations if a "bridge" transition representation (TR) is employed to make it compatible with both NL and SQL in the phase of conversion. In this article, we propose an automatic SQL generator with TR called GTR in cross-domain DB systems. Specifically, GTR contains three SQL generation steps: 1) GTR learns the relation between questions and DB schemas; 2) GTR uses a grammar-based model to synthesize a TR; and 3) GTR predicts SQL from TR based on the rules. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets, that is, WikiSQL and Spider. On the testing set of the Spider and WikiSQL datasets, the results show that GTR achieves 58.32% and 71.29% exact matching accuracy which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, respectively.

DE Human-object interaction (HOI) detection; object detection; zero-shot
   learning (ZSL)
AB Human-object interaction (HOI) detection involves identifying interactions represented as ?human, action, object?, requiring the localization of human-object pairs and interaction classification within an image. This work focuses on the challenge of detecting HOIs with unseen objects using the prevalent Transformer architecture. Our empirical analysis reveals that the performance degradation of novel HOI instances primarily arises from misclassifying unseen objects as confusable seen objects. To address this issue, we propose a similarity propagation (SP) scheme that leverages cosine similarity distance to regulate the prediction margin between seen and unseen objects. In addition, we introduce pseudo-supervision for unseen objects based on class semantic similarities during training. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic-aware instance-level and interaction-level contrastive losses with Transformer to enhance intraclass compactness and interclass separability, resulting in improved visual representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, V-COCO and HICO-DET, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods under various zero-shot settings.

AB Automated object measurement is becoming increasingly important due to its ability to reduce manual costs, increase production efficiency, and minimize errors in various fields. In this paper, we present a novel approach to three-dimensional (3D) object measurement based on point cloud modeling. Our method introduces a fast point cloud modeling computation framework consisting of five stages: coordinate centralization, rotation and translation, noise filtering, plane projection, and geometric computation. Furthermore, we propose a fast convex hull optimization algorithm to reduce the high complexity problem of traditional convex hull calculation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of measurement error rate and time savings, with a maximum time saving of 31.03% under certain error conditions.

AB One of the biggest difficulties, which China's power infrastructure is now experiencing, is the capacity to estimate demand of short-term electricity. It can accurately estimate changes in the total power load in particular locations. Accurate forecasting results, which also serve as a dependable guide for power system operation, may increase the flexibility and resource usage of the contemporary power market. Power load characteristics are impacted by several things. This study presents an estimate method for short-term demand of electricity based on WOA-BILSTM in order to comprehensively evaluate the time series features presented in the power load data and improve the accuracy of power load forecasting. After extracting features for the variables that influence power load, this method uses the bidirectional long-term and short-term memory (BILSTM) neural network layer for bidirectional time series feature learning. Using the local electricity load data from Quanzhou from 2018 as the data set, the prediction model is constructed by screening the multi-dimensional input parameters and selecting the feature vectors with good association as the input carefully. By comparing the outcomes of three popular load forecasting models, including LSTM network, BILSTM network, and WOA-BILSTM, it is demonstrated that the WOA-BILSTM neural network method is more accurate and effective than others two. By building an optimal combination model, this technique could increase the accuracy of power load data's short-term predictions. At the same time, it also reduces the time of personnel debugging.

ID COEVOLUTION
AB The formation and evolution of public opinion have been widely studied to understand how consensus forms due to atomic interactions between individuals. While many studies have paid attention to modelling influence and interaction, most of the literature assumes static agents, ignoring the frequent changes in physical locations expected in real life. This feature naturally allows humans to interact with diverse people and avoid disagreement, which heavily impacts the co-evolution of opinions, communities or isolation in human societies. Our previous work proposed an extension of the bounded confidence model inspired by the theories of homophily and cognitive dissonance, which concern humans' natural behaviours of attraction and disagreement. Although this demonstrated a marked difference to a static opinion model and purely random mobility, the limited experiments gave little insight into the causes or the resulting structures of consensus. This article addresses these shortcomings through a thorough investigation of the impact of mobility modelled by different mechanisms. Through extensive simulation, we observe a transition from multiple stable opinion clusters to complete consensus and a shift from a geographically based organisation to isolated structure-less agents. Lastly, we propose a novel classification of the different outcomes of self-organisation in opinion models, highlighting the patterns of emerging behaviours across the spectrum of interaction range and influence parameters.

AB Finding densely connected groups of nodes in networks is a widely-used tool for analysis in graph mining. A popular choice for finding such groups is to find subgraphs with a high average degree. While useful, interpreting such subgraphs may be difficult. On the other hand, many real-world networks have additional information, and we are specifically interested in networks with labels on edges. In this paper, we study finding sets of labels that induce dense subgraphs. We consider two notions of density: average degree and the number of edges minus the number of nodes weighted by a parameter & alpha;\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document}. There are many ways to induce a subgraph from a set of labels, and we study two cases: First, we study conjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have all labels. Secondly, we study disjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have at least one label. We show that both problems are NP-hard. Because of the hardness, we resort to greedy heuristics. We show that we can implement the greedy search efficiently: the respective running times for finding conjunctive-induced and disjunctive-induced dense subgraphs are in Oplogk\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\mathcal {O} \mathopen {}\left( p \log k\right)$$\end{document} and Oplog2k\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\mathcal {O} \mathopen {}\left( p \log <^>2 k\right)$$\end{document}, where p is the number of edge-label pairs and k is the number of labels.

ID MOBILITY
AB Next-location prediction, consisting of forecasting a user's location given their historical trajectories, has important implications in several fields, such as urban planning, geo-marketing, and disease spreading. Several predictors have been proposed in the last few years to address it, including last-generation ones based on deep learning. This paper tests the generalization capability of these predictors on public mobility datasets, stratifying the datasets by whether the trajectories in the test set also appear fully or partially in the training set. We consistently discover a severe problem of trajectory overlapping in all analyzed datasets, highlighting that predictors memorize trajectories while having limited generalization capacities. We thus propose a methodology to rerank the outputs of the next-location predictors based on spatial mobility patterns. With these techniques, we significantly improve the predictors' generalization capability, with a relative improvement in the accuracy up to 96.15% on the trajectories that cannot be memorized (i.e., low overlap with the training set).

AB In this study, it is aimed to determine the factors affecting the mathematics achievements of eighth-grade students through trends in international mathematics and science study 2019 and compare the classification performances according to sample sizes and the number of independent variables of Bagging and Adaboost methods. Firstly, the most important factors affecting mathematics skills were obtained by using feature selection methods. Then, the performances of the methods were examined according to the sample size and the number of variables. As a result of the analysis carried out, no obvious difference was found between the performances of the methods according to the number of independent variables. On the other hand, the performances of methods of this study varied according to sample sizes, and it was seen that Bagging method showed better classification performance than Adaboost method in all sample sizes, and the performance of both methods approached each other when a sample of 3000 units was used.

ID SYSTEM
AB Data fusion technology plays a pivotal role in aggregating, storing, and mining multi-source data to extract its joint value through the construction of a unified fusion representation model. However, we argue that mainstream methods are limited to precise data, which may not satisfy practical application requirements, as data collected from an information source often exhibits imprecision and uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a Multi-source Fuzzy Data-driven Dynamic Fusion Representation (MFD-DFR) model. This model effectively addresses the challenges related to heterogeneity, dynamics, and quality optimization that arise during the fusion of fuzzy data. To achieve this goal, we first adopt intervals as a means of description to capture the inherent uncertainty in single-source information. We then present a Dynamic Interval Standardization (DIS) algorithm, a novel approach that dynamically deals with the heterogeneity of multi-source fuzzy data without relying on the storage of historical sample data. We next propose a fusion representation model for standardized intervals that improves the quality of single-source fuzzy data through confidence interval estimation. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the MFD-DFR model outperforms alternative models in terms of data classification and clustering. We also show the effectiveness of our proposed DIS algorithm in expediting the convergence speed of gradient descent algorithms.

AB This paper introduces a novel online multi-label classification approach that focuses on optimizing the distribution of multi-label classification margins. The objective is to find a new multi-label model in each online round that maximizes the margin mean and minimizes the margin standard deviation while remaining close to the current model. To address this optimization problem, two methods are proposed. The first method employs dual coordinate descent to solve the dual problem iteratively, while the second method utilizes online gradient descent to solve the first-order approximation of the primal problem efficiently. Experimental evaluations are conducted on nine benchmark datasets, using seven common multi-label performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art methods, affirming the effectiveness and efficiency of optimizing the distribution of multi-label classification margins.

AB The current study theoretically analyzes the magnetohydrodynamic Williamson fluid flow along with convective boundary conditions over a stretching cylinder. The modified Fourier's and modified Fick's law is considered in view of the response of heat and mass transfer. The effect of heat generation/absorption is also considered. With the suitable similarity transformations, the flow equations are converted into dimensionless ordinary differential equations. Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the current problem numerically by adopting shooting scheme. Influences of various physical parameters on the flow fields are shown graphically and skin friction parameter, local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are presented in tabular form. To verify the accuracy of our numerical results in light of previous results, a comparison table has been generated. The results revealed that the velocity of fluid increases by increasing curvature parameter while decreases for magnetic parameter and Williamson fluid parameter. The temperature and concentration profiles rises due to increase in heat and mass Biot number parameters.

AB This paper addresses an integrated material flow optimization problem of cross-docking satellites, in which the transportation problem, the truck-door assignment problem with material placement plans, and the two-dimensional truck loading problem are taken into account. The study aims to find the best distribution and operational plans for the cross-docking satellites to minimize the total transportation cost of the materials. To solve the considered problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is developed, which integrates simulated annealing (SA) algorithm within a genetic algorithm (GA). In this way, a new individual with a low solution quality is rejected by using the stochastic solution acceptance feature of the SA. Moreover, the HGA is enhanced with an advanced two-dimensional loading-check procedure and a rule-based material placement procedure to obtain efficient solutions. The proposed loading-check procedure reduces the processing time of the HGA by avoiding duplicate examinations for the truck loading plans. Likewise, the rule-based material placement procedure prevents unnecessary searches for the assignment plans of the products in a temporary storage area. In computational studies, the performance of the HGA is tested on two different problem sets by comparing HGA with the SA and GA. Furthermore, the HGA is applied to a problem set that is formed by using real-life data of a logistics company. The computational results show that the HGA introduces effective solutions and outperforms both the SA and GA. In addition, the results of the real-life application denote that the HGA can be employed to find effective material flow plans in real situations of cross-docking operations.

AB Automation is inherently tied to ethical challenges because of its potential involvement in morally loaded decisions. In the present research, participants (n = 34) took part in a moral multi-trial dilemma-based task where the agent (human vs. machine) and the behavior (action vs. inaction) factors were randomized. Self-report measures, in terms of morality, consciousness, responsibility, intentionality, and emotional impact evaluation were gathered, together with electroencephalography (delta, theta, beta, upper and lower alpha, and gamma powers) and peripheral autonomic (electrodermal activity, heart rate variability) data. Data showed that moral schemata vary as a function of the involved decider, and when the agent and behavior factors are crossed. Subjects did not consider machines full moral deciders to the same degree as humans and tend to morally better accept human active behavior and machine inaction. Moreover, the autonomic physiological activity might support the a-posteriori moral evaluation. In the evaluation of the agent's consciousness, a beta ventrolateral prefrontal synchronization was detected for human action and machine inaction, while a generalized gamma synchronization occurred in artificial agent trials while rating the emotional impact of the decider's behavior. The detected differences might point to a potential explicit and implicit asymmetry in moral reasoning toward artificial and human agents.

AB Although the work of identifying animal and plant objects with highly similar patterns (e.g., texture, intensity, colour, etc.) to the background has recently attracted more research interest but rarely involves the military complex environment. Design an efficient camouflage small-scale object detection algorithm that is capable of quickly discriminating the objects in open scenes from a long distance, to pre-empt the enemy. In this work, we first recognize the fact that existing open-source training datasets are scarce, and we have created a specific disguised people benchmark covering multiple scenes and weather conditions. Second, because the severe corruption of camouflage capabilities and chaotic scenes in the open battlefield on detailed features and generalization intensifies the challenge of feature extraction from a long-range perspective, we propose a novel end-to-end Small-scale open scene Camouflage Object Detection Network, called SM-CODN. Inspired by the characteristics of biological brain partition, a multi-domain partition module (MPM) with domain-decoupling is proposed to enable specific knowledge learning for samples with obvious discrepancies in camouflage domain distribution. Concurrent with our work, we have designed a multi-scale fusion module (MFM) to strengthen the semantic features related to small-scale disguised objects. Moreover, due to the convergence direction of the detector in reasoning being inconsistent, a feature separation enhancement module (FSEM) is also proposed. Experimental results show that SM-CODN surpasses many classic object detection methods and shows strong competitiveness compared with state-of-the-art ones.

AB Accurate organ segmentation in ultrasound (US) images remains challenging because such images have inhomogeneous intensity distributions in their regions of interest (ROIs) and speckle and imaging artifacts. We address this problem by developing a coarse-to-refinement architecture for the segmentation of multiple organs (i.e., the prostate and kidney) in US image datasets from multiple centers. Our proposed architecture has the following four advantages: (1) it inherits the ability of the deep learning models to locate an ROI automatically while also using a principal curve approach to automatically fit a dataset center; (2) it takes advantage of a principal curve-based enhanced polygon searching method, which inherits the principal curve's characteristic to automatically approach the center of the dataset; (3) it incorporates quantum characteristics into a storage-based evolution network together to improve the global search performance of our method, which includes several improvements, such as a new quantum mutation module, a cuckoo search method, and global optimum schemes; (4) it incorporates a suitable mathematical model to smooth the contour of ROIs, which is explained by the parameters of a neural network model. Application of our method to US image datasets of multiple organs and from multiple centers demonstrates that it achieves satisfactory segmentation performance.

AB The path planning problem is the core issue in the automatic guided vehicle (AGV) sorting system. The current AGV sorting system has the following characteristics: (1) a great number of AGVs; (2) dynamic sorting of tasks; and (3) two-stage tasks involving transporting express packages and then leaving the sorting area. Therefore, existing path planning methods face challenges in terms of achieving timeliness and optimality. In this paper, the path planning problem of the AGV sorting system in a mesh topology area is modeled. A Driving Line-based Two-Stage (DLTS) path planning algorithm is proposed. First, to avoid conflicts among AGVs with different driving directions, time-space resources are divided according to the driving line mechanism, which specifies the driving direction, possible planned locations and specific driving rules. Second, we propose an incremental search method to plan continuous paths for two-stage tasks while simultaneously avoiding conflicts among AGVs moving in the same direction. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our method in terms of real-time and optimal performance through simulation experiments.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Generation of complex patterns at a specific timing is crucial to most forms of learning and behavior, which are acquired through dopamine-modulated plasticity in the striatum. However, the neural mechanisms of such reward-based spatiotemporal processing remain unknown. Inspired by the cortico-striatal circuits, this study developed a new reservoir computing method, a class of recurrent neural networks, based on reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) for the spatiotemporal motor learning. We utilized a reservoir of basal dynamics (reBASICS), which generated self-sustained limit cycle oscillations with various frequencies, as a reservoir structure. Then, the oscillations were linearly integrated as readout output, in which readout weights were modulated with RMHL. The simulations showed that reBASICS-based RMHL was able to accomplish both motor timing and pattern drawing tasks, for which existing reservoir-based RMHL failed. Further, introducing an eligibility trace mechanism into RMHL allowed the model to learn motor timing even when reward-based modulation was delayed. In conclusion, this model is proposed as a new computational model of temporal processing of the striatum, where the cortical areas generate stable oscillations. From the oscillatory dynamics, spatiotemporal patterns are learned using RMHL in the striatum.

AB Nowadays, economic and environmental concerns in production have become increasingly significant. To address these issues, the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem has been introduced to optimize the power generation process by considering fuel cost and emitted substances. However, due to the nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the objective function, the optimization of CEED remains a challenge. In this paper, we develop a Reinforcement Learning-based Adaptive Differential Evolution (RLADE) algorithm to enhance the optimization performance. The mutation strategy and crossover probability of RLADE are optimized using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to respectively ensure better convergence speed and searchability. Additionally, two modifications of RL, namely the adaptive population size-based state division and fitness-rankingbased reward mechanism, are proposed to improve the accuracy of state division and reward calculation in RL. The experiments conducted in this paper consider two objective formulation methods of CEED problems, namely the quadratic and cubic criterion functions. The mean values and standard deviations of the obtained solutions were utilized to assess the performance of RLADE, as well as other comparative algorithms, namely DE algorithm and two RL-based DE variants. The results clearly demonstrate that RLADE surpasses its counterparts with proportion of 100%, 85.7%, and 100% for the 6-unit and 11-unit quadratic CEED problems, as well as cubic criterion functions, in terms of both search accuracy and convergence ability. Furthermore, the significance of RLADE's superiority is confirmed through the Wilcoxon's signed rank test.

AB Deep learning often requires large amounts of labeled data to train the model, which is not always readily available in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). Related research work on SER in few shot conditions has reported problem with overfifitting and domain transfer of training. In this study, a few-shot learning method based on meta-transfer learning with domain adaption (MTLDA) is proposed for SER. It not only effectively reduces the over-fitting phenomenon of deep neural networks (DNN) trained with a small number of samples, but also solves the forgetting problem in meta-learning and the target domain adaptability problem in transfer learning. Experiments on three databases (i.e., CASIA is used for pre-training, Emo-DB and SAVEE are used for few-shot learning) are performed for few-shot learning of SER, from which the WAR is 65.12% and UAR is 64.50% on Emo-DB, and the WAR is 58.84% and UAR is 53.26% on SAVEE.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Random pruning: channel sparsity by expectation scaling factor
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Channel pruning; Random sparse; Model compression; Image classification
ID NETWORKS
AB Pruning is an efficient method for deep neural network model compression and acceleration. However, existing pruning strategies, both at the filter level and at the channel level, often introduce a large amount of computation and adopt complex methods for finding sub-networks. It is found that there is a linear relationship between the sum of matrix elements of the channels in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the expectation scaling ratio of the image pixel distribution, which is reflects the relationship between the expectation change of the pixel distribution between the feature mapping and the input data. This implies that channels with similar expectation scaling factors (dE) cause similar expectation changes to the input data, thus producing redundant feature mappings. Thus, this article proposes a new structured pruning method called EXP. In the proposed method, the channels with similar dE are randomly removed in each convolutional layer, and thus the whole network achieves random sparsity to obtain non-redundant and non-unique sub-networks. Experiments on pruning various networks show that EXP can achieve a significant reduction of FLOPs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, EXP reduces the FLOPs of the ResNet-56 model by 71.9% with a 0.23% loss in Top-1 accuracy. On ILSVRC-2012, it reduces the FLOPs of the ResNet-50 model by 60.0% with a 1.13% loss of Top-1 accuracy.

AB Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are common forms of neurodegenerative dementia. Be-havioral alterations and cognitive impairments are found in the clinical courses of both diseases, and their differential diagnosis can sometimes pose challenges for physicians. Therefore, an accurate tool dedicated to this diagnostic challenge can be valuable in clinical practice. However, current structural imaging methods mainly focus on the detection of each disease but rarely on their differential diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for both disease detection and differential diagnosis. We suggest utilizing two types of biomarkers for this application: structure grading and structure atrophy. First, we propose to train a large ensemble of 3D U-Nets to locally determine the anatomical patterns of healthy people, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Frontotemporal dementia using structural MRI as input. The output of the ensemble is a 2-channel disease's coordinate map, which can be transformed into a 3D grading map that is easily interpretable for clinicians. This 2-channel disease's coordinate map is coupled with a multilayer perceptron classifier for different classification tasks. Second, we propose to combine our deep learning framework with a traditional machine learning strategy based on volume to improve the model discriminative capacity and robustness. After both cross-validation and external validation, our experiments, based on 3319 MRIs, demonstrated that our method produces competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods for both disease detection and differential diagnosis.

AB By using Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), people can quantitatively describe and process information with fuzziness, and then make reasonable and effective judgments or decisions. In this process, distance measure often serves as a useful and important tool. The purpose of this paper is to explore some information processing methods and techniques in Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Firstly, the research progress of PFS is reviewed, and the main research directions and some hot issues in relevant research fields are discussed. Secondly, by analyzing the information of hesitation degree of Pythagorean fuzzy number (PFN), definitions of hesitation factor and centroid distance measure based on the representation of centroid coordinates of the hesitation regions are proposed, and properties of hesitation factor and centroid distance measure are discussed. Finally, the novel clustering algorithm, ranking method and multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method are developed in Pythagorean fuzzy environment, which are based on the new centroid distance measure. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods are verified through numerical examples and comparative analysis. The research results indicate that the centroid distance measure proposed in this paper can effectively characterize the distance between PFNs, thus making the clustering algorithm of PFNs, the ranking method of PFNs, and the Pythagorean fuzzy MCDM method have obvious superiorities and advantages.

TI Enhancing Structural Crack Detection through a Multiscale Multilevel
   Mask Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Line Similarity Index
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a novel and practical crack-detection method for infrastructure. The proposed method exhibits three key components. First, a multiscale multilevel mask deep convolutional neural network (MSML Mask DCNN) is proposed to accurately estimate crack candidates comprising linear and curvilinear features. Second, the proposed neural network is trained using only public image-sets. The main principle of this approach is that cracks have unique and distinct features, and therefore, public image-sets provide sufficient information to estimate crack candidates for a neural network. Third, a line similarity index (LSI), which is calculated using the Hough transform and coordinate transformation with principal component analysis, is incorporated to eliminate non-crack candidates from crack candidates based on two key characteristics: the variation in crack features with respect to the representative line and the number of crack features that crossed the representative line. Addressing these two crack-related characteristics improves accuracy and robustness by effectively eliminating non-crack features. Field tests performed inside a building and in an underground power tunnel demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The MSML Mask DCNN outperformed other neural networks, accurately recognizing local crack candidates characterized by linear and curvilinear features even though only public image-sets were used for training. The proposed LSI also effectively eliminated non-crack candidates estimated by the MSML Mask DCNN. The proposed method is practical for real-world applications, where several non-crack objects and noises are typically present.

AB Currently, multimodel databases are widely used in modern applications, but the default configuration often fails to achieve the best performance. How to efficiently manage and tune the performance of multimodel databases is still a problem. Therefore, in this study, we present a configuration parameter tuning tool MMDTune+ for ArangoDB. First, the selection of configuration parameters is based on the random forest algorithm for feature selection. Second, a workload-aware mechanism is based on k-means++ and the Pearson correlation coefficient to detect workload changes and match the empirical knowledge of historically similar workloads. Finally, the ArangoDB configuration parameters are optimized based on the improved TD3 algorithm. The experimental results show that MMDTune+ can recommend higher-quality configuration parameters for ArangoDB compared to OtterTune and CDBTune in different scenarios.

ID PENALIZED MATRIX DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM; SCATTER; CCA
AB A well-known shortcoming of the traditional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is the lack of robustness against outliers. This shortcoming hinders the application of CCA in the case where the training data contain outliers. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes robust CCA (RCCA) methods for the analysis of multivariate data with outliers. The robustness is achieved by the use of weighted covariance matrices in which the detrimental effect of outliers is reduced by adding small weight coefficients on them. The RCCA is then extended to the robust sparse CCA (RSCCA) by imposing the l1-norm constraints on canonical projection vectors to obtain the sparsity property. Based on the RCCA and RSCCA, a robust data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method is proposed for industrial processes. A residual generation model is built using projection vectors of the RCCA or RSCCA. The robust squared Mahalanobis distance of the residual is used for fault detection. A contribution-based fault diagnosis method is developed to identify the faulty variables that may cause the fault. The performance and advantages of the proposed methods are illustrated with two case studies. The results of two case studies prove that the RCCA and RSCCA methods have high robustness against outliers, and the robust FDD method is able to yield reliable results even if using the low-quality training data with outliers.

AB Multivariate time series classification has become popular due to its prevalence in many real-world applications. However, most state-of-the-art focuses on improving classification performance, with the best-performing models typically opaque. Interpretable multivariate time series classifiers have been recently introduced, but none can maintain sufficient levels of efficiency and effectiveness together with interpretability. We introduce Z-Time, a novel algorithm for effective and efficient interpretable multivariate time series classification. Z-Time employs temporal abstraction and temporal relations of event intervals to create interpretable features across multiple time series dimensions. In our experimental evaluation on the UEA multivariate time series datasets, Z-Time achieves comparable effectiveness to state-of-the-art non-interpretable multivariate classifiers while being faster than all interpretable multivariate classifiers. We also demonstrate that Z-Time is more robust to missing values and inter-dimensional orders, compared to its interpretable competitors.

AB Accurate water demand forecasting is essential for water utilities for effective water planning and pump scheduling. To conduct effective water planning and pump scheduling, Sydney Water needs a reliable method for predicting water demand. Short-term water demand forecasting deep learning based models have been applied to different datasets collected from various water plants in the Greater Sydney region. This paper uses correlation analysis, the attention mechanism and a deep convolutional neural network to identify and study the importance of n number of factors that inform water prediction in the Greater Sydney region. The aim of this study is to develop, evaluate and compare multi-variate input deep learning-based models to predict water demand in various locations in the Greater Sydney region. This paper investigates five models - the recurrent neural network (RNN), long shortterm memory networks (LSTM), bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The results of this study demonstrate that all the proposed models achieved a superior forecasting performance with accuracy hits of 97% using water consumption and climate factors as input data. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID TEXT CLASSIFICATION
AB Personality reflects how people can behave in different situations and affects their decisions. Analyzing personality is useful in many fields, for example in the prediction of performance in a job. Emotion recognition is another important research topic due to the wide spread of social media. People express their feeling in form of Facebook posts, tweeter real reactions, and shares. Understanding both personality and emotions from the written text is much easier when it comes to humans. However, this task is impossible with the huge amount of data spread all other social media. The use of machine learning algorithms for personality and emotion recognition from text data is a new research field. In this paper, we propose an enhanced recognition system for personality recognition and emotion recognition. The proposed enhanced recognition system is composed of four main modules, namely data acquisition module, data preprocessing module, personality recognition module, and emotion recognition module. Several machine learning algorithms are used for the multiclass classification process. Gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used for hyperparameter optimization, while group GWO (GGWO) algorithm is used for feature selection. The proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 99.99% using the random forest algorithm for personality detection and 88.06% using a decision tree for emotion recognition, which outperforms other state-of-the-art studies. We can profit from social media despite some of its drawbacks by understanding people's emotions through their tweets, posts, etc. For instance, before someone commits suicide, we can tell what their intentions are. Most suicide committers, according to recent studies, leave suicide notes on their social media accounts, and these letters need to be taken seriously.

AB Manual term extraction is similar to literal meaning: A translator browses text, classifies words, and prepares for translation. Terminology, as a centralized carrier of expertise, creation, popularization, and disappearance, dynamically reflects the development and evolution of an industry. The automatic extraction of terminology is a key technology for creating a professional terminology database, and it is also a key topic in the field of natural language processing. The purpose of this paper is to study how to analyse a term extraction algorithm based on machine learning and a comprehensive feature strategy. Focusing on the problems of poor generality and single statistical features of current term extraction algorithms, this paper proposes an improved domain ontology term extraction algorithm based on a comprehensive feature strategy. Moreover, automatic term extraction experiments based on a word-based maximum entropy model and a conditional random field model based on machine learning are conducted in this paper. Its word-based conditional random field model outperforms the maximum entropy model. The experimental results show that the algorithm based on the comprehensive feature strategy improves the accuracy by 8.6% compared with the TF-IDF algorithm and the C-value term extraction algorithm. This algorithm can be used to effectively extract the terms in a text and has good generality.

TI FATE: a three-stage method for arithmetical exercise correction

DT Article; Early Access
DE Arithmetical exercise; Transformer; Contrastive learning; Spotting
AB As the number of primary students rapidly rises, the highly repetitive task of correcting arithmetical exercises consumes much time for teachers and hinders them from concentrating more on the growth of students. To reduce the workload of teachers, arithmetical exercise correction (AEC) is proposed to automatically detect, recognize and correct various arithmetical exercises in the workbook. However, two crucial issues need to be addressed since the research in this field is still immature, i.e., accurate detection of the arithmetic exercise with various structures and the effective recognition of long-size exercise. In this paper, we propose a three-stage method dubbed as FATE, to correct arithmetical exercises in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we apply the anchor-free model with a feature pyramid network and constraint of centerness to avoid the redundant bounding boxes. On the other hand, we employ a transformer-based framework with contrastive learning to extract global symbol information and generate corresponding sequences. Finally, we design a series of rule-based templates to correct the generated sequence based on the unique features of each type of arithmetical exercises, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields the detection average precision of 96.8%, the recognition accuracy of 92.3% and the F1 score of 91.2% in spotting experiment on the public dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB Underwater robots are widely used in underwater missions. However, due to complex scenes, it is difficult to obtain high-quality underwater images, which usually suffer from severe distortions such as low visibility, blurred edges, and color cast. In this paper, a Transformer embedded generative adversarial network for underwater image enhancement is presented. We propose a window-based dual local enhancement block to compensate for the Transformer's shortcomings in extracting local features and improving image clarity. Convolutional neural network is deployed in sequential and parallel modes for local enhancement. Second, for generator construction, a fusion scheme combining convolutional neural network and Transformer block in units is designed. We exploit a self-attention mechanism to extract long-distance dependencies and fully extract the original features at the initial stage to enhance the image details. Meanwhile, global information is captured through the bottleneck for color correction. Convolutional neural network, which is good at extracting local features, is introduced in Encoder/Decoder units for multiscale feature extraction and reconstruction to effectively reduce edge blurring. Finally, a Transformer embedded generative adversarial network with a two-branch discriminator is established to generate more realistic colors while preserving the image content. Comparative experimental results show that our method can achieve superior results to the state-of-the-art approaches on both paired and unpaired datasets. Excellent learning and generalization ability make it outperform others in subjective perception and overall performance evaluated by image quality metrics. In addition, the enhancement results also show the significant improvement it brings in the downstream visual application tasks.

AB A q-ROFS (q-rung orthopair fuzzy set) is one of the most trustworthy tool to handle the uncertainties in the data during the decision-making process. The q-ROFS is a generalization of the A-IFS (Atanassov-intuitionistic fuzzy set), PFS (Pythagorean fuzzy set). Considering the uncertainties in MAGDM (multi-attribute group decision-making process) problems, we present a concept of EL-q-ROFS, defined as exponential logarithm(EL) based q-ROFS, which is obtained by integrating the idea of EL into the standard q-ROFSs. Based on this notion, we stated the influence of the parameters associated with EL-q-ROFS on to the membership degrees. The main contributions of the work are listed as follows: (1) the construction of the concept of EL-q-ROFS along with their basic operations and operators. The influence of the parameter associated with them is also discussed. (2) a novel MAGDM algorithm with EL operators is proposed where the attribute weights are computed with an exponential entropy. (3) a several numerical examples are provided to verify the approach and compare their study with the several existing ones. (4) the advantages and merits of the proposed work are also verified through several counterexamples in the group decision making process.

AB The geodesic model based on the eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) has served as a fundamental tool for the applications of image segmentation and boundary detection in the past two decades. However, the existing approaches commonly only exploit the image edge-based features for computing minimal geodesic paths, potentially limiting their performance in complicated segmentation situations. In this paper, we introduce a new variational image segmentation model based on the minimal geodesic path framework and the eikonal PDE, where the region-based appearance term that defines then regional homogeneity features can be taken into account for estimating the associated minimal geodesic paths. This is done by constructing a Randers geodesic metric interpretation of the region-based active contour energy functional. As a result, the minimization of the active contour energy functional is transformed into finding the solution to the Randers eikonal PDE. We also suggest a practical interactive image segmentation strategy, where the target boundary can be delineated by the concatenation of several piecewise geodesic paths. We invoke the Finsler variant of the fast marching method to estimate the geodesic distance map, yielding an efficient implementation of the proposed region-based Randers geodesic model for image segmentation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images exhibit that our model indeed achieves encouraging segmentation performance.

AB The progress of EEG-based emotion recognition has received widespread attention from the fields of human-machine interaction and cognitive science. However, recognizing emotions with limited labelled data is still challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a self-supervised group meiosis contrastive learning (SGMC) framework for EEG-based emotion recognition. First, to reduce the dependence of emotion labels, SGMC introduces a contrastive learning task according to the alignment of video clips based on the similar EEG response across subjects. Moreover, the model adopts a group projector to extract group-level representations from the group samples to further decrease the subject difference and random effects in EEG signals. Finally, a novel genetics-inspired data augmentation method, named meiosis is developed, which takes advantage of the alignment of video clips among a group of EEG samples to generate augmented groups by pairing, cross exchanging, and separating. The experiments show that SGMC exhibits competitive performance on the publicly available DEAP and SEED datasets. It is worth of noting that the SGMC shows a high ability to recognize emotion even when using limited labelled data. Moreover, the results of feature visualization suggest that the model might have learned video-level emotion-related feature representations to improve emotion recognition. The hyper-parametric analysis further shows the effect of the group size during emotion recognition. Finally, the comparisons of both the symmetric function and the ablation models and the analysis of computational efficiency are carried out to examine the rationality of the SGMC architecture. The code is provided publicly online.

AB Traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the learned knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain on the same label set. The strong assumptions of full annotations on the source domain and a closed label set of the two domains might not hold in real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate a practical but challenging domain adaptation scenario, termed few-shot universal domain adaptation (FUniDA), where only a few labeled data are available in the source domain and the label sets of the source and target domains are different. Existing few-shot UDA (FUDA) methods and universal domain adaptation (UniDA) methods cannot address this novel domain adaptation setting well. The FUDA methods would misalign the unknown samples of the target domain and the private samples of the source domain, and the UniDA methods cannot perform well with only a small number of labeled source samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel domain consensual contrastive learning (DCCL) framework for FUniDA. Specifically, DCCL comprises two major components: 1) in-domain consensual contrastive learning aims to learn discriminative features from few labeled source data, and 2) cluster matching and cross-domain consensual contrastive learning aim to align the features of common samples in the source and target domains while keeping the private samples as private.

AB The rich diversity of human language allows speakers to seamlessly transition between multiple languages during conversations. While humans have the remarkable ability to become proficient in multiple languages in a short period, developing machines that can converse in multiple natural languages with an understanding of diverse dialects requires sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as dialect recognition and intent extraction. This facilitates mutual understanding between parties who use phrases, sentences, words, or expressions from multiple languages within a single context. The work in this paper, propose a trilingual approach to multi-dialect conversation modeling within the same conversational session and context for a mix of English, Hindi-English text, Hindi-Devanagari text and Yoruba text. The model identifies the language used and determines the intent behind a query to respond in the same dialect. Our model is capable of detecting the end of a conversation, and it also detects the predominant dialect and responds accordingly in scenarios where a user's input query contains a mix of languages. This approach is particularly useful in situations where there is limited data available for multilingual or trilingual conversation tasks based on Intent Detection (ID). We evaluate our proposed pipeline and model on three benchmark ID datasets and a trilingual dialogue dataset for response retrieval by intent decoding. Our model outperforms existing approaches in terms of performance metrics and has faster training time. Moreover, our trilingual approach to multi-dialect conversation modeling provides a versatile tool for efficient and effective inter-dialect conversational automation, even when dealing with large datasets, with minimal parameters and low resource overhead. The lightweight architectural pipeline and efficient algorithms used in our model contribute to its high performance and versatility.

AB Blind and visually impaired (BVI) face various problems during their navigation. Being unable to rely on sight greatly restricts their capacity to learn information about their surroundings. Scene recognition is crucial in improving life quality for BVI. Scene recognition systems can recognize and characterize the visual world using powerful artificial intelligence algorithms, allowing users to receive a critical overview. Indoor scene recognition systems are crucial for BVI to explore their environment. These systems are essential for increasing their independence, safety, and overall quality of life. Developing technology that allows BVI to perceive their environment and enable them to navigate and interact with the world on their own is extremely important. We propose in this paper a scene recognition system to assist BVI in their daily activities. The proposed work was developed on top of an efficient set of deep learning techniques called "Deep Evolutionary Algorithms (DEAs)". DEAs are a type of algorithm that solves complicated search problems by combining the principles of evolutionary computing with deep learning. DEAs provide optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. They iteratively develop a population of potential networks to identify optimum or near-optimal networks to solve complicated problems through genetic methods including mutation, crossover, and selection. To ensure the efficiency of the proposed work, extensive experiments have been conducted using two benchmark datasets the MIT 67 dataset and the Scene 15 dataset. New state-of-the-art results have been ensured by the proposed work in terms of recognition accuracy.

AB Accurately forecasting short-term traffic flow is essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, current methods often struggle to fully exploit implicit variation patterns and heterogeneous correlations in traffic flow data, and can be sensitive to non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-immune and attention-based multi-modal model (NIAMNet) for short-term traffic flow forecasting. Inspired by the success of computer vision techniques, NIAMNet transforms one-dimensional traffic flow into images and embeds residual dual-attention blocks (RDB) to extract in-deep features. Besides, we introduce a dynamic noise-immune loss to address the impact of noise and outliers on model performance. Experimental results on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NIAMNet over existing methods, achieving the lowest MAPE (10.43, 9.79, 10.51, and 11.01) and RMSE (247.13, 192.36, 208.40, and 150.01). Additional ablation experiments are carried out to provide insight into the significance of each component. Our approach contributes to the development of more accurate and robust short-term traffic flow forecasting models.

ID LINK PREDICTION; NETWORKS
AB Link prediction is a widely adopted method for extracting valuable data insights from graphs, primarily aimed at predicting interactions between two nodes. However, there are not only pairwise interactions but also multivariate interactions in real life. For example, reactions between multiple proteins, multiple compounds, and multiple metabolites cannot be mined effectively using link prediction. A hypergraph is a higher-order network composed of nodes and hyperedges, where hyperedges can be composed of multiple nodes, and can be used to depict multivariate interactions. The interactions between multiple nodes can be predicted by hyperlink prediction methods. Since hyperlink prediction requires predicting the interactions between multiple nodes, it makes the study of hyperlink prediction much more complicated than that of other complex networks, thus resulting in relatively limited attention being devoted to this field. The existing hyperlink prediction can only predict potential hyperlinks in uniform hypergraphs, or need to predict hyperlinks based on the candidate hyperlink sets, or only study hyperlink prediction for undirected hypergraphs. Therefore, a hyperlink prediction framework for predicting multivariate interactions based on graph representation learning is proposed to solve the above problems, and then the framework is extended to directed hyperlink prediction (e.g., directed metabolic reaction networks). Furthermore, any size of hyperedges can be predicted by the proposed hyperlink prediction algorithm framework, whose performance is not affected by the number of nodes or the number of hyperedges. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to both the biological metabolic reaction network and the organic chemical reaction network, and experimental analysis has demonstrated that the hyperlinks can be predicted efficiently by the proposed hyperlink prediction framework with relatively low time complexity, and the prediction performance has been improved by up to 40% compared with the baselines.

AB Concept drift refers to the inevitable phenomenon that influences the statistical features of the data stream. Detecting concept drift in data streams quickly and precisely remains challenging, and failure to detect it will render model trained on historical data ineffective. Current drift detection methods suffer from the following problems: detection delay, many false detected drifts, and rarely utilize the deep neural network directly in the field of concept drift detection, which is considerably competent at addressing the classification problems of data stream. Furthermore, the output of the model is usually taken as a metric to detect drift, while changes in the model parameters are often ignored which contain highly useful information. In this paper, we propose a model-centric framework for concept drift detection that uses deep neural network to detect concept drift by focusing on the change in the model itself, rather than the model output. In addition, transfer learning is developed to accelerate the drift detection process and reduce the computational complexity by freezing parts of the network. To further reduce false detected drifts, we propose long and short time windows method to determine the real drift from the potential detected drift. Experiments with real-world and artificial datasets have been undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The asymptotic stability of the fractional-order neural networks system with uncertainty by sampled-data controller is addressed in the article. First, considering the influence of uncertainty and fractional-order on the system, a novel sampled-data controller is designed with alterable sampling period. In the light of the input delay approach, the fractional system is simulated by the delay system. The main purpose of the method presented is to design a sampled-data controller, which the closed-loop fractional-order system can guarantee the asymptotic stability. Then, the fractional-order Razumikhin theorem and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are utilized to derive the stable conditions. The stability conditions are presented in the form of LMIs on the novel delay-dependent and order-dependent. Furthermore, the sampling controller can be acquired to promise the stability and stabilization for fractional-order system. Finally, two numerical examples are proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages for the provided method.

AB The current investigation aims at the adaptive consensus issue for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with time delays and unknown disturbances under a directed graph topology. A novel designed disturbance observer eliminates the impact on the consensus induced by unknown external disturbances. Furthermore, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method is applied to tackle the time delays in the design process. With the approximation capability of neural networks, the adaptive controller is developed by the backstepping technique, which can alleviate the burden of computing and make the consensus tracking error converge to a small compact region. The control scheme proposed in this paper enables the nonlinear multiagent systems to achieve consensus output. Meanwhile, a numerical simulation example is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI TIEN: Temporal interest-aware evolution model for "Next Item

AB The "next item recommendation" is used to predict the next item that a user may be interested in and its main challenges is identifying the user's interests. The current state-of-the-art methods mostly adopt time-series-based recommendation methods but ignore the role of time intervals in the interest evolution process. This motivated us to propose a new Time Interest-aware Evolutionary Network model (TIEN) to predict the next item that a user may be interested in. TIEN highlights the role of time intervals in the interest evolution process and divides interests into long-term interests and short-term interests. In TIEN: (1) We devise a time interval-based attention network TAN to capture the user's interests, which employs item embeddings, behavior sequence embeddings, and time intervals to calculate the user's interest attention; (2) We devise an ATT-GRU network based on candidate activation vectors to capture the interest evolution process, which skillfully leverages the reset gate, hidden layer state, item information, time intervals, etc. to participate in interest evolution; (3) We introduce a dual-network collaborative training mechanism, where the obtained interests of users are treated as weights to guide the interest evolution process. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that TIEN has higher performance than the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB The statistical supervised learning framework assumes an input-output set with a joint probability distribution that is reliably represented by the training dataset. The learning system is then required to output a prediction rule learned from the training dataset's input-output pairs. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the sample complexity, the empirical risk and the generalization error based on the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) (Shannon, 1948). We provide theoretical guarantees for reliable learning under the information-theoretic AEP, with respect to the generalization error and the sample size in different settings.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Continuous sign language recognition; Efficient inference; Scalable
   frame resolution; Adaptive inference
AB In this paper, we explore the spatial redundancy in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), aiming to improve its efficiency. Despite recent advances in accuracy in CSLR, state-of-the-art CSLR methods typically require large amounts of computations and memory occupation, which are not friendly towards fast inference under limited computation/memory budgets. Based on a simple observation that not all frames are equally important for CSLR, we propose AdaSize to handle this problem by modeling the frame resolution decision as an end-to-end learnable task to save unnecessary computations. Specifically, a lightweight 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) is first used to quickly browse input frames under a low resolution (e.g., 112 x 112). These extracted coarse and cheap features are sent into a recurrent policy network to dynamically determine the desired resolution for each frame. Once the optimal resolution for each frame is decided, frames with different resolutions are fed into the following backbones to extract representative features. Finally, these features pass through a sequence of temporal modules and a classifier to predict sentences. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily and CSL, demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSize. AdaSize could consistently achieve comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art CSLR methods, with only 0.38x computations, 0.41x memory usage and 1.25x throughput. Comparisons with commonly-used lightweight backbones and other efficient methods verify the superiority of AdaSize under similar computational/memory budgets. We finally plot the frame resolution decisions for AdaSize, hoping to provide insightful analysis of the inherent spatial redundancy in videos.

AB In the contemporary enterprise software market, there has been a notable surge in the utilization of SaaS products. This trend has prompted certain upstream suppliers of cloud resources, commonly referred to as cloud providers, to introduce their own SaaS offerings, thereby augmenting the competition within the industry. The matter of optimal releasing strategy encountered by software firms in this industry has been scarcely addressed in prior literature. Therefore, the present study employs the Hotelling model to depict the market segmentation in the context of a software firm's selection among three distinct strategies, namely on-premise, SaaS, and dual version strategies, to effectively manage competition. Through an examination of the optimal pricing and profit for each strategy, and a subsequent analysis of the resulting profits, we have managed to arrive at conclusive recommendations for optimal strategy selection. Based on the analytical findings, it can be inferred that the selection of the optimal strategy can be classified into two distinct scenarios, which are contingent upon the magnitude of the unit cloud rental fee. In a high-cost rental environment, the optimal release strategy shifts from the SaaS strategy and dual version strategy to the on-premise strategy, as the disparity in value between on-premise and SaaS versions increases. In a context of low rental fee and a widening value gap, the optimal strategy choice sequence is as follows: SaaS, on-premise, dual version, on-premise, dual version, and ultimately on-premise. Furthermore, we analyze and reveal the impact of various factors on the maximum profit that software companies can achieve. The findings we have derived have significant implications for software companies' decision-making in the face of the challenge posed by highly centralized public cloud supply.

ID UNCERTAIN DATA
AB As the importance of data-based predictive maintenance frameworks is rising, one of the emerging issues is the missing values in industrial data. Data with various missing values due to measurement sensor faults and power change issues can not only cause errors in future analyses but also lead to data shortages. Although various missing value estimation methods have been proposed to address this issue, correction methods that consider the fine uncertainty and noise of the missing values themselves have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, this study modeled missing values estimated using Gaussian progress regression by considering the fine movements and noises of data using a quantum mechanics-based stochastic differential equation and corrected them using Ito's lemma. Estimating the missing data in this manner more closely simulates the attributes of data compared to existing estimation methods, enabling more accurate analysis. To demonstrate the excellence of the proposed framework, missing values were estimated using vehicle operation data and semiconductor manufacturing data with multiple missing values, and the estimation results were compared with those of existing algorithms.

AB The meteorological cloud mainly provides computing ability and meteorological datasets for meteorological model tasks. If the location of the required dataset and the execution location of the task are different, this will consume a large amount of time and bandwidth to transfer the data for the task. Meteorological data layout allocates meteorological datasets to various clouds. Because meteorological datasets are required by multiple meteorological model tasks and multiple times, the data layout is very important in the meteorological clouds. This paper focuses on how to layout out the meteorological datasets based on the association (internal meteorological datasets and between meteorological model tasks) and schedule resources for meteorological model tasks in the meteorological cloud. First, to find the association in the meteorological datasets and meteorological models, we use Apriori algorithm to mine frequent itemsets between datasets used by different meteorological models, and then we use the result to help layout meteorological data. After that, we present a heuristic algorithm for scheduling meteorological tasks. Finally, simulation comparison shows that the meteorological data layout method has a lowest value in the number of involved clouds for every task, the average size of transmitted datasets from other clouds, and the average time of transmitted datasets between clouds. We also prove that the scheduling method based on the data layout increases the number of completed tasks before their deadlines and reduces the average execution time.

   clustering
AB The success of deep learning (DL) based-mechanical fault diagnosis hinges on the high quality of training data. However, it is difficult to acquire high-quality mechanical monitoring data due to data contamination: 1) Monitoring device irregularities, such as sensor malfunction and signal transmission disruption, bring anomalies into the training data; 2) human labour-based data annotation inevitably produces incorrectly labeled data. These two types of data contamination degrade the performance of DL models. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a graph neural network-based data-cleaning method. In the first stage, a group anomaly detector is designed to identify the presence of anomalous data. This detector incorporates affinity graphs for depicting data groups and subsequently calculates the group anomaly score to determine the abnormal group. In the second stage, a graph clustering model is developed to relabel the mislabeled data. This model takes advantage of the graph neural network's proficiency in handling affinity graphs to prepare clean labels for subsequent network training. Experimental results, conducted on a pump and an industrial robot joint reducer, show the proposed method's ability to effectively detect anomalous data and rectify incorrect labeling, surpassing the performance of baseline methods in mechanical fault diagnosis.

AB Image restoration under severe weather is a challenging task. Most of the past works focused on removing rain and haze phenomena in images. However, snow is also an extremely common atmospheric phenomenon that will seriously affect the performance of high-level computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Recently, some methods have been proposed for snow removing, and most methods deal with snow images directly as the optimization object. However, the distribution of snow location and shape is complex. Therefore, failure to detect snowflakes/snow streak effectively will affect snow removing and limit the model performance. To solve these issues, we propose a Snow Mask Guided Adaptive Residual Network (SMGARN). Specifically, SMGARN consists of three parts, Mask-Net, Guidance-Fusion Network (GF-Net), and Reconstruct-Net. Firstly, we build a Mask-Net with Self-pixel Attention (SA) and Cross-pixel Attention (CA) to capture the features of snowflakes and accurately localized the location of the snow, thus predicting an accurate snow mask. Secondly, the predicted snow mask is sent into the specially designed GF-Net to adaptively guide the model to remove snow. Finally, an efficient Reconstruct-Net is used to remove the veiling effect and correct the image to reconstruct the final snow-free image. Furthermore, we propose a more refined dataset of real snow images, SnowWorld24, to provide faster evaluation of snow-free images. Extensive experiments show that our SMGARN numerically outperforms all existing snow removal methods, and the reconstructed images are clearer in visual contrast. All codes are available at https://github.com/MIVRC/SMGARN.

AB For better reliability of tractors with continuously variable transmission, reported here is fault diagnosis of their power-shift systems. First, four hydraulic system faults are analyzed, i.e., pipe leakage, pipe blockage, a stuck solenoid valve spool, and a stuck clutch piston, and it is shown that these lead to clutch energy loss during power shifting and possibly even clutch burn-out. Second, fault simulations give more than 30000 groups of test data, and an improved dynamic time warping algorithm is used to segment the data samples automatically. Third, an improved echo state network is proposed to classify the above fault samples, and its performance is compared with those of traditional algorithms. Finally, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is tested using samples with noise superimposed. The results show that the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the improved echo state network are 96.87%, 96.31%, 97.11%, and 96.71%, respectively, making it equivalent in performance to a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory. However, the training speed of the former is significantly better than that of the latter, and even under the influence of strong noise, the proposed algorithm can still achieve an accuracy of 91.32%, which is better than the latter's 86.62%. This is significantly better than traditional algorithms, thus demonstrating the better generalization characteristics and robustness of the pro-posed approach.

AB The rising number of cases of human Mpox has emerged as a major global concern due to the daily increase of cases in several countries. The disease presents various skin symptoms in infected individuals, making it crucial to promptly identify and isolate them to prevent widespread community transmission. Rapid determination and isolation of infected individuals are therefore essential to curb the spread of the disease. Most research in the detection of Mpox disease has utilized convolutional neural network (CNN) models and ensemble methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, none have utilized a meta-heuristic-based ensemble approach. To address this gap, we propose a novel metaheuristics optimization-based weighted average ensemble model (MO-WAE) for detecting Mpox disease. We first train three transfer learning (TL)-based CNNs (DenseNet201, MobileNet, and DenseNet169) by adding additional layers to improve their classification strength. Next, we use a weighted average ensemble technique to fuse the predictions from each individual model, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to assign optimized weights to each model during the ensembling process. By using this approach, we obtain more accurate predictions than individual models. To gain a better understanding of the regions indicating the onset of Mpox, we performed a Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis to explain our model's predictions. Our proposed MO-WAE ensemble model was evaluated on a publicly available Mpox dataset and achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.78%. This outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the same dataset, thereby providing further evidence of the efficacy of our proposed model.

DE Text-to-image synthesis; Contrastive learning; Word self-attention; Dual
   attention generator
AB Synthesizing realistic fine-grained images from text descriptions is a significant computer vision task. Although many GANs-based methods have been proposed to solve this task, generating high -quality images consistent with text information remains a difficult problem. These existing GANs-based methods ignore important words due to the use of fixed initial word features in generator, and neglect to learn semantic consistency between images and texts for discriminators. In this article, we propose a novel attentional generation and contrastive adversarial framework for fine-grained text-to-image synthesis, termed as Word Self-Update Contrastive Adversarial Networks (WSC-GAN). Specifically, we introduce a dual attention module for modeling color details and semantic information. With a new designed word self-update module, the generator can leverage visually important words to compute attention maps in the feature synthesis module. Furthermore, we contrive multi-branch contrastive discriminators to maintain better consistency between the generated image and text description. Two novel contrastive losses are proposed for our discriminators to impose image-sentence and image-word consistency constraints. Extensive experiments on CUB and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Network intrusion is one of the main threats to organizational networks and systems. Its timely detection is a profound challenge for the security of networks and systems. The situation is even more challenging for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of developing countries where limited resources and investment in deploying foreign security controls and development of indigenous security solutions are big hurdles. A robust, yet cost-effective network intrusion detection system is required to secure traditional and Internet of Things (IoT) networks to confront such escalating security challenges in SMEs. In the present research, a novel hybrid ensemble model using random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) method is proposed to increase the predictive performance of intrusion detection system (IDS). Compared to the deep learning paradigm, the proposed machine learning ensemble method could yield the state-of-the-art results with lower computational cost and less training time. The evaluation of the proposed ensemble machine leaning model shows 99%, 98.53% and 99.9% overall accuracy for NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed ensemble method successfully optimizes the performance of intrusion detection systems. The outcome of the research is significant and contributes to the performance efficiency of intrusion detection systems and developing secure systems and applications.

TI J-score: a robust measure of clustering accuracy
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Cluster analysis; Accuracy metrics
AB Background. Clustering analysis discovers hidden structures in a data set by partitioning them into disjoint clusters. Robust accuracy measures that evaluate the goodness of clustering results are critical for algorithm development and model diagnosis. Common problems of clustering accuracy measures include overlooking unmatched clusters, biases towards excessive clusters, unstable baselines, and difficulties of interpretation. In this study, we presented a novel accuracy measure, J-score, to address these issues.
   Methods. Given a data set with known class labels, J-score quantifies how well the hypothetical clusters produced by clustering analysis recover the true classes. It starts with bidirectional set matching to identify the correspondence between true classes and hypothetical clusters based on Jaccard index. It then computes two weighted sums of Jaccard indices measuring the reconciliation from classes to clusters and vice versa. The final J-score is the harmonic mean of the two weighted sums.
   Results. Through simulation studies and analyses of real data sets, we evaluated the performance of J-score and compared with existing measures. Our results show that J-score is effective in distinguishing partition structures that differ only by unmatched clusters, rewarding correct inference of class numbers, addressing biases towards excessive clusters, and having a relatively stable baseline. The simplicity of its calculation makes the interpretation straightforward. It is a valuable tool complementary to other accuracy measures. We released an R/jScore package implementing the algorithm.

AB Neuroimaging markers based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with various other measures (such as genetic covariates, biomarkers, vascular risk factors, neuropsychological tests etc.) might provide useful predictions of clinical outcomes during the progression towards Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of multiple features in predictive frameworks for clinical outcomes has become increasingly prevalent in AD research. However, many studies do not focus on systematically and accurately evaluating combinations of multiple input features. Hence, the aim of the present work is to explore and assess optimal combinations of various features for MR-based prediction of (1) cognitive status and (2) biomarker positivity with a multi kernel learning Gaussian process framework. The explored features and parameters included (A) combinations of brain tissues, modulation, smoothing, and image resolution; (B) incorporating demographics & clinical covariates; (C) the impact of the size of the training data set; (D) the influence of dimensionality reduction and the choice of kernel types. The approach was tested in a large German cohort including 959 subjects from the multicentric longitudinal study of cognitive impairment and dementia (DELCODE). Our evaluation suggests the best prediction of memory performance was obtained for a combination of neuroimaging markers, demographics, genetic information (ApoE4) and CSF biomarkers explaining 57% of outcome variance in out-of sample predictions. The highest performance for A  42/40 status classification was achieved for a combination of demographics, ApoE4, and a memory score while usage of structural MRI further improved the classification of individual patient's pTau status.

AB Compared with other biometrics, such as fingerprints and irises, EEG signals contain richer identity information due to their high subject dependence. In this study, we proposed an affective EEG-based person identification by using an affective interrelated temporal-spatial transformer (AITST) to overcome the influence of different emotional states in affective EEG-based person identification. The AITST contains an interrelated temporal- spatial attention that can preserve the interrelationships of temporal and spatial domains while extracting temporal and spatial features of the EEG signal. We evaluated the proposed AITST on the public emotional database DEAP. The experimental results show that our AITST can reach an average recognition accuracy of 98.94 & PLUSMN;0.04% in the low valence, low arousal state, 99.06 & PLUSMN;0.02% in low valence, high arousal state, 98.97 & PLUSMN;0.02% in high valence, low arousal state, and 99.21 & PLUSMN;0.03% in the high valence, high arousal state, significantly outperforming the other compared models and overcoming the influence of different emotional states. Furthermore, we explored the contribution of different frequency bands, different emotional states and different features of EEG for EEG-based person identification. The results showed that gamma band of EEG, power spectrum density (PSD), and high arousal state have the greatest contribution to affective EEG-based person identification.

AB Solving constrained optimization problems (COPs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is a popular research direction due to its potential and diverse applications. One of the key issues in solving COPs is the choice of constraint handling techniques (CHTs), as different CHTs can lead to different evolutionary directions. Combining EAs with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising and emerging approach for solving COPs. Although DRL can help solve the problem of pre-setting operators in EAs, neural networks need to obtain diverse training data within a limited number of evaluations in EAs. Based on the above considerations, this work proposes a DRL assisted co-evolutionary differential evolution, named CEDE-DRL, which can effectively use DRL to help EAs solve COPs. (1) This method incorporates co-evolution into the extraction of training data for the first time, ensuring the diversity of samples and improving the accuracy of the neural network model through information exchange between multiple populations. (2) Multiple CHTs are used for offspring selection to ensure the algorithm's generality and flexibility. (3) DRL is used to evaluate the population state, taking into account feasibility, convergence, and diversity in the state setting and using the overall degree of improvement as a reward. The neural network selects suitable parent populations and corresponding archives for mutation. Finally, (4) to avoid premature convergence and local optima, an adaptive operator selection and individual archive elimination mechanism is added. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark functions CEC2010 and CEC2017 show that the proposed method performs competitively and produced robust solutions. The results of the application test set CEC2020 show that the proposed algorithm is also effective in real-world problems.

AB Various benchmark sets have already been proposed to facilitate comparison between metaheuristics, or Evolutionary Algorithms. During the competition, typically algorithms are allowed either to run until the allowed number of function calls is exhausted (and one compares the quality of solutions found), or until a required objective function value is obtained (one compares the speed in reaching the required solution). During the last 20 years several problem sets were defined using the first approach. In this study, we test 73 optimization algorithms proposed between the 1960 & PRIME;s and 2022 on nine competitions based on four sets of problems (CEC 2011, CEC 2014, CEC 2017, and CEC 2020) with different dimensionalities. We intend to test the original versions of 73 algorithms "as they are", with control parameters proposed by the authors of the particular method. The recent benchmark set, CEC 2020, includes fewer problems and allows much more function calls than the former sets. As a result, one group of algorithms perform best on older, a different one on the more recent (CEC 2020) benchmark sets. Almost all algorithms that perform best on CEC 2020 set achieve moderate -to-poor performance on older sets, including real-world problems from CEC 2011. Algorithms that perform best on older sets are more flexible than those that perform best on CEC 2020 benchmark. The choice of the benchmark may have a crucial impact on the final ranking of algorithms. The lack of tuning may affect the results that were obtained in this study, hence it is highly recommended to repeat a similar large-scale comparison with control parameters of each algorithm tuned, best by different methods, separately for each benchmark set.

AB In pathology, cancer grading is crucial for patient management and treatment. Recent deep learning methods, based upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential for automated and accurate cancer diagnosis. However, these do not explicitly utilize tissue/cellular composition, and thus difficult to incorporate the existing knowledge of cancer pathology. In this study, we propose a multi-cell type and multi-level graph aggregation network (MMGA-Net) for cancer grading. Given a pathology image, MMGA-Net constructs multiple cell graphs at multiple levels to represent intra-and inter-cell type relationships and to incorporate global and local cell-to-cell interactions. In addition, it extracts tissue contextual information using a CNN. Then, the tissue and cellular information are fused to predict a cancer grade. The experimental results on two types of cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMGA-Net, outperforming other competing models. The results also suggest that the information fusion of multiple cell types and multiple levels via graphs is critical for improved pathology image analysis.

AB Multi-view representation learning aims to capture comprehensive information from multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive learning to different views in a pairwise manner, which is still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are coequally treated; evenly measuring the similarities between terms might interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works study the theoretical framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning paradigm from the perspective of information theory and then propose a novel information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC constructs self-adjusted contrasting pools, which are adaptively modified by a view filter. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn representations and reduce the gradient interference. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rolling bearings are crucial for ensuring the safe and stable operation of electromechanical systems. Although deep learning has been widely used in fault diagnosis of rolling bearings, it is unable to accurately diagnose faults when the system operates under multiple working conditions. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research on fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under multiple working conditions to ensure the reliable operation of electromechanical systems. The potential features related to working conditions may be reflected in the different layers of the deep neural network (DNN). However, information loss during the process of layer-by-layer feature extraction may result in the loss of potential features related to changes in working conditions, which in turn affects the fault diagnosis results. This study focused on developing a multiscale recursive fusion strategy for a DNN by designing a new attention model with a lower computational burden. The proposed multiscale recursive fusion strategy guided by the attention mechanism can help correctly characterize the potential features related to variations in working conditions by allocating more attention to useful information and less attention to useless information on the adjacent layers of the DNN. Experimental tests for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings verified that the proposed method is superior to existing methods for fault diagnosis when the system is operated under multiple working conditions.

AB Metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology, especially laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), has received abundant interest from industries and the research community. Process optimization methods have thus multiplied to improve the overall quality of the final parts. However, little attention has been given to the quality repeatability issue. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective robust parameter optimization framework to explore optimal process parameters with respect to relative density and dimensional accuracy of LPBF-fabricated parts. Specifically, a modified k-means clustering, named the Extended and Weighted K-means (EWK-means), was constructed to simultaneously optimize the mean and the variance of the multiple responses. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. In addition, the effects of the process parameters, environment-related parameters, and physical properties on the hardness of the parts were analyzed using several machine learning models. The results showed that the proposed method achieved a set of optimal process parameters with better quality and satisfactory variability in the printed parts compared with other robust parameter optimization methods.

   Integrating Matrix Factorization and Genetic Algorithms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

ID DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY; EFFICIENT; MODEL
AB As recommendation systems heavily depend on user data, these systems are susceptible to potential privacy breaches. To mitigate this issue, differential privacy (DP) protection techniques have been developed to offer robust privacy safeguards. Nevertheless, a majority of the extant DP-based recommendation algorithms tend to introduce excessive noise, consequently impairing the quality of recommendations. In response, this study presents a novel DP-preserving recommendation algorithm that integrates matrix factorization (MF) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Initially, the MF problem is transformed into two interrelated optimization problems, namely, the user-hidden factor and the item-hidden factor. Subsequently, GA is employed to address these optimization issues. An enhancement index mechanism is incorporated into the individual selection of GA, while the variation process of GA is devised based on identifying crucial hidden factors. Utilizing the enhancement index mechanism aids in minimizing the algorithm's perturbation level, thereby achieving an optimal balance between privacy protection and algorithm utility. Experimental analyses, encompassing recommendation accuracy, efficiency, and parameter variation effects, are conducted on Last.fm and Flixster datasets. The findings corroborate that the proposed system outperforms existing alternatives under stringent privacy constraints, thereby attesting to its efficacy.

TI A Lightweight and Multisource Information Fusion Method for Real-Time
   Monitoring of Lump Coal on Mining Conveyor Belts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the underground transportation of coal mainly relies on the mine conveyor belt to complete, the mine conveyor belt with large pieces of coal will affect transportation safety. Therefore, to address the problem of real-time monitoring of lump coal, the method Ghost-ECA-Bi FPN (GEB) YOLOv5 for lump coal in the process of mining conveyor belt transportation is proposed based on a lightweight neural network and multisource information fusion. First, the image preprocessing is performed by adaptive histogram equalization, which reduces the influence of coal dust, dust, and uneven lighting on target monitoring. Second, the redundancy of the convolution process is exploited, and a lightweight neural network GhostNet is introduced to optimize the feature extraction process. In addition, combined with the efficient channel attention mechanism, the 1D convolution enables local cross-channel information interaction, which can solve the problem of imbalance between model complexity and performance. Finally, the feature information of the three stages is fused using a weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network to enhance the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results show that the improved GEB YOLOv5 algorithm has obvious advantages. In terms of model structure, the number of network layers reduces by 36.97%, and the number of model structure parameters and floating-point operations reduce by 64.53% and 69.14%, respectively. Moreover, the model volume reduces from 92.7 M to 33.0 M. Regarding the monitoring performance, the precision and recall rates improve by 1.19% and 1.11%, respectively. Furthermore, the real-time performance improves from 68.34 FPS to 110.70 FPS. It can be seen that the problem of the model performance against the model complexity is effectively solved in this experiment and the real-time monitoring of lump coal is realized.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB Visual object tracking (VOT) for intelligent video surveillance has attracted great attention in the current research community, thanks to advances in computer vision and camera technology. Meanwhile, discriminative correlation filter (DCF) trackers garnered significant interest owing to their high accuracy and low computing cost. Many researchers have introduced spatial and temporal regularization into the DCF framework to achieve a more robust appearance model and further improve tracking performance. However, these algorithms typically set fixed spatial and temporal regularization parameters, which limit flexibility and adaptability under cluttered and challenging scenarios. To overcome these problems, in this work, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal regularization for the DCF tracking model that emphasizes the filter to concentrate on more reliable regions during the training stage. Furthermore, we present a response deviation-suppressed regularization term for responses to encourage temporal consistency and avoid model degradation by suppressing relative response changes between two consecutive frames. Moreover, we introduce a multi-memory tracking framework to exploit various features and each memory contributes to tracking the target across all frames. Significant experiments on the OTB-2013, OTB-2015, TC-128, UAV-123, UAVDT, and DTB-70 datasets have revealed that the performance thereof outperformed many state-of-the-art trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks in terms of tracking accuracy and tracking success rate.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Deep ensemble learning, where we combine knowledge learned from multiple individual neural networks, has been widely adopted to improve the performance of neural networks in deep learning. This field can be encompassed by committee learning, which includes the construction of neural network cascades. This study focuses on the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLS) domain and introduces multiple instance ensemble (MIE) as a novel stacking method for ensembles and cascades. In this study, our proposed approach reformulates the ensemble learning process as a multiple-instance learning problem. We utilise the multiple-instance learning solution of pooling operations to associate feature representations of base neural networks into joint representations as a method of stacking. This study explores various attention mechanisms and proposes two novel committee learning strategies with MIE. In addition, we utilise the capability of MIE to generate pseudo-base neural networks to provide a proof-of-concept for a "growing'' neural network cascade that is unbounded by the number of base neural networks. We have shown that our approach provides (1) a class of alternative ensemble methods that performs comparably with various stacking ensemble methods and (2) a novel method for the generation of high-performing "growing'' cascades. The approach has also been verified across multiple HDLS datasets, achieving high performance for binary classification tasks in the low-sample size regime. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB This paper presents a secure face recognition system with advanced template protection schemes for Cyber- Physical-Social Services (CPSS). The implementation of the proposed system consists of five components. The initial step performs image preprocessing, where it detects the facial region from the captured image using the Tree-Structured Part Model (TSPM). The second phase involves feature extraction, where it utilizes the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor to extract features from small patches of the preprocessed images, forming a collection of feature descriptors. The collection of feature descriptors is then clustered using the K means clustering algorithm, returning the centers of K-clusters that serve as the vocabulary of a dictionary. Finally, a histogram is generated using the vocabularies and frequencies, referred to as the "Bag of Visual Words (BoVW)". Using this dictionary and a feature learning technique called Sparse Representation Coding (SRC), followed by Spatial Pyramid Mapping (SPM), the system generates feature vectors from training/testing image samples. In the third component, the modified FaceHashing technique is applied to the original feature vectors, generating cancelable feature vectors. The fourth component employs a Bio-Cryptographic technique to preserve the cancelable feature vectors in a database. Lastly, the fifth component utilizes a multi-class linear SVM classifier on the decrypted and query-cancellable feature vector to classify users. The system evaluates its performance using FERET and CASIA-FaceV5 benchmark databases, providing 100% identification accuracy for 200-dimensional cancelable feature vectors. The performance and security comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system over existing methods.

AB Efficient and accurate medical image segmentation is necessary for pathological evaluation and disease diagnosis in clinical practice. In recent years, the U-shaped encoder-decoder structure has achieved good performance in various medical image segmentation tasks. It is a neural network model similar to the letter U, which can gradually reduce the spatial dimension of the feature map to capture high-level semantic information in the feature encoding stage, and can make up for the lack of target detail information in the feature decoding stage to decouple the final segmentation results. However, the U-shaped encoder-decoder structure still suffers from semantic asymmetry and global semantic dilution problems, which are exacerbated during decoding, due to the limitation of the framework's fixation. In this paper, we propose a cross-level collaborative context-aware framework (C3-Net) to address the aforementioned issues in medical image segmentation. The main contributions of this research include: (i) To address the inherent problems in the U-shaped structure, we propose the C3-Net to explore the differences between cross-level contextual information effectively; (ii) To achieve detailed information preservation and semantic information enhancement, we present a Channel Scale-aware Context Enhancement (CSCE) module to enhance low-level contextual features from the global and local scales of the channel dimension; (iii) A Spatial Pyramid Context Alignment (SPCA) module is designed to extract and align pyramid features, thus obtaining accurate global contextual features at the network's top; (iv) We propose a Cross-Level Collaborative Context Refinement (CCCR) module to enable efficient collaboration between cross-level contextual features to simultaneously achieve semantic alignment and global semantic enhancement. The outcomes of implementing the proposed method on three publicly available datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and GlaS) and one private dataset (VMICH) show that the proposed method outperforms all competing approaches on four datasets.

AB Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a commonly seen neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis of MS is a crucial issue to promote patient health. Since MS diagnosis is a computer vision problem, machine learning can be utilized for this purpose. Important research has used transfer learning (TL) to rapidly apply the advantages of deep learning models. Therefore, TL has developed a wide usage in computer vision applications. Herein, we describe a new algorithm in this regard, termed transfer-transfer (TT). To implement the algorithm, a multi-result machine learning model is required. In order to determine efficacy, we use transfer learning-based and hybrid feature engineering. The goal is to demonstrate the classifiability of the TT model.Materials and method: A new magnetic resonance image dataset containing three classes were collected to obtain TT model results, i.e.: (1) multiple sclerosis (MS), (2) myelitis, and (3) control patients. We have designed this model for MS detection. Thus, we named it MSNet. For deep feature engineering, MSNet with two layers of pretrained DenseNet201 and two layers of ResNet50 was incorporated into the system since these networks are highly accurate. By deploying these four layers, four feature vectors were calculated. ReliefF (RF), Chi2, and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) were utilized in the feature selection phase, and the number of the feature vectors is increased from 4 to 12 (=4 x 3). By using k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, 24 (=12 x 2) outputs were calculated, with the best result created by applying information fusion. TT incorporates the information fusion findings to construct a new feature vector. The most salient features were selected by deploying an iterative feature selector, and the features chosen were then classified.Results: The TT-based MSNet was applied to the magnetic resonance (MR) image dataset, yielding a 97.63% classification accuracy. Conclusions: The findings and computed results demonstrate that the TT model with MSNet outperforms existing systems with increased transfer learning classifiability.

AB This article investigates the conceptual connection between argumentation and explanation in the law and provides a formal account of it. To do so, the methods used are conceptual analysis from legal theory and formal argumentation from AI. The contribution and results are twofold. On the one hand, we offer a critical reconstruction of the concept of legal argument, justification, and explanation of decision-making as it has been elaborated in legal theory and, above all, in AI and law. On the other hand, we propose some definitions of explanation in the context of formal legal argumentation, showing a connection between formal justification and explanation. We also investigate the notion of stable normative explanation developed elsewhere in Defeasible Logic and extend some complexity results. Our contribution is thus mainly conceptual, and it is meant to show how notions of explanation from literature on explainable AI and legal theory can be modeled in an argumentation framework with structured arguments.

DE Emotion-cause pairs extraction; Experiencer identification; ATOMIC;
   Causality commonsense; Heterogeneous graph
AB Numerous approaches have been explored to learn relations between emotion and cause clauses as a key step in the extraction of emotion-cause pairs. Despite their effectiveness, there are some limitations of previous studies: (1) they ignored that the emotion experiencer is an important clue implicating causality between clauses and (2) ignored that causal commonsense as prior knowledge can enhance semantic associations between clauses. In this paper, we propose a novel Experiencer-Driven and Knowledge -Aware Graph Model (EDKA-GM). For the first limitation, we introduce an experiencer identification task and present a document-level heterogeneous graph network for capturing global experiencer information to enrich experiencer-based cross-clause association. For the second, we retrieve the causal commonsense from the ATOMIC knowledge base for each clause and establish a knowledge-aware graph network to further enhance the inter-clause relationship by modeling a full connection graph of clauses with commonsense knowledge. We are the first to explore the influence of experiencer on emotion-cause pair extraction. On a benchmark dataset, our approach performs better than competitive baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is a widely implemented approach for determining the weights of criteria and alternatives from pairwise comparison matrices. FAHP methodology uses triangular fuzzy as a tool for the decision-maker to arrange judgments expressed as the pairwise comparison matrix elements. FAHP is then modeled into a nonlinear constrained optimization problem to increase the decision maker's satisfaction. However, in some cases, this model would yield multiple optimal solutions. Logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) is offered to overcome this unfavorable situation. Nevertheless, LFPP includes a parameter in its model for which no specific method is available to determine. Meanwhile, the differences in parameter values will affect the solution. In the worst case, the weights obtained will be inaccurate. As a result, the decision taken based on the weights will be biased and unreliable. This issue is particularly important when it requires high accuracy. It includes the decisions on the portfolio investment, economic, human capital measurements, and shipping registry. Another crucial thing is that the use of the natural logarithm function in the LFPP method has the potential for an overflow effect at the computational stage when it is implemented to derive the weights. Therefore, in the application context, it is significant to improve the shortcomings of the LFPP method in terms of parameter involvement and the use of the logarithmic function. For this purpose, this paper proposes a non-parameter transcendental fuzzy preference programming (TFPP) model for deriving the optimal weights from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. The TFPP is obtained by investigating different functions' effects on fuzzy preference programming (FPP). The proposed method has a more general form. One of the specific forms of the TFPP is chosen in a computational implementation. The numerical results confirm that the TFPP optimization model is reliable in obtaining the optimum global weights. The comparison with the LFPP method also shows that the TFPP is more efficient.

ID DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH; ARCHITECTURE; MODEL
AB Passenger flow prediction is critical for subway managers to efficiently organize passenger flow and assign capacity resources. Station closures caused by economic conferences and political events alter the topology of subway networks, resulting in large-scale passenger flows with irregular trends. Thus, predicting subway passenger flow during station closures is a challenging task. In this study, we propose a hybrid model for predicting short-term passenger flow during subway station closures. First, a spatiotemporal ensemble prediction model is used to capture the temporal characteristics of passenger flow at each station and the spatial characteristics of passenger flow among distinct groups of stations. Then, to address the effects of station closures, a support vector regression method is devised to investigate the residual time series from the ensemble model. Finally, a case study of Beijing subway is examined to validate the performance of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model is superior to other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and reliability in estimating the effects of station closures. Furthermore, the residuals from station closures are thoroughly converted into white noise and the proposed model is more interpretable than those in previous studies.

DE Pre-trained language model; Knowledge Editing; Dynamantic interfence
AB As Pre-trained language models (LMs) play an important role in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, it is becoming increasingly important to make sure the knowledge learned from LMs is valid and correct. Unlike conventional knowledge bases, LMs implicitly memorize knowledge in their parameters, which makes it harder to correct if some knowledge is incorrectly inferred or obsolete. The task of Knowledge Editing is to correct errors in language models, avoiding the expensive overhead associated with retraining the model from scratch. While existing methods have shown some promising results, they fail on multi-edits as they ignore the conflicts between these edits.In the paper, we propose a novel framework to divide-and-conquer edits with parallel Editors. Specifically, we design explicit and implicit multi-editor models to learn diverse editing strategies in terms of dynamic structure and dynamic parameters respectively, which allows solving the conflict data in an efficient end-to-end manner.Our main findings are: (i) State of the art Knowledge Editing methods with multiple editing capability, such as MEND and ENN, can hardly outperform the fine-tuning method; (ii) Our proposed models outperform the fine-tuning method over the two widely used datasets for Knowledge Editing; (iii) Additional analytical experiments verify that our approach can learn diverse editing strategies, thus better adapting to multiple editing than state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID QUADRATIC STACKELBERG GAMES; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; CONTROLLER
AB In this paper, the problem of multiplayer hierarchical decision-making problem for non-affine systems is solved by adaptive dynamic programming. Firstly, the control dynamics are obtained according to the theory of dynamic feedback and combined with the original system dynamics to construct the affine augmented system. Thus, the non-affine multiplayer system is transformed into a general affine form. Then, the hierarchical decision problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game. In the Stackelberg game, the leader makes a decision based on the information of all followers, whereas the followers do not know each other's information and only obtain their optimal control strategy based on the leader's decision. Then, the augmented system is reconstructed by a neural network (NN) using input-output data. Moreover, a single critic NN is used to approximate the value function to obtain the optimal control strategy for each player. An extra term added to the weight update law makes the initial admissible control law no longer needed. According to the Lyapunov theory, the state of the system and the error of the weights of the NN are both uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the algorithm are confirmed by simulation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intent-detection (ID) and slot-filling (SF) are fundamental tasks for natural language understanding. This study introduces a new encoder-decoder CNN-Transformer-based architecture (CTRAN) designed for ID and SF. The encoder integrates of BERT, followed by several convolutional layers with different kernel sizes. We propose using a kernel size of 1 to preserve the one-to-one correspondence between input tokens and output tags. Subsequently, we rearrange the output of the convolutional layer using the window feature sequence and apply stacked Transformer encoders. The ID decoder leverages self-attention and a linear layer, while the SF decoder employs an aligned Transformer decoder with a zero diagonal mask, facilitating alignment between output tags and input tokens. We evaluate our model on ATIS and SNIPS datasets, achieving 98.46% and 98.30% F1 score for the SF task, respectively. These results surpass the previous state-of-the-art by 0.64% and 0.99%. Moreover, we compare two strategies: using a language model as the encoder or as word embedding. We find out that the latter strategy yields better results.

TI Lightning risk assessment of offshore wind farms by semi-supervised

DE Lightning disaster; Laplacian support vector machine; Lightning risk
   assessment; Semi-supervised learning
AB The wind turbine has rapidly developed worldwide with increasing height and scale, resulting in the increased risk of lightning strikes. When wind turbines were stroke by the lightning, they will be damaged, causing economic loss and outage. Lightning risk assessment can guide the improvement of lightning protection and the design of the wind farms to efficiently prevent lightning damages. The traditional lightning risk assessment methods rely on subjective features to some extent. The existing lightning risk assessment methods based on machine learning demand abundant labeled data. It is extremely difficult to label and acquire the data. This paper proposed a lightning risk assessment method based on semi-supervised learning to address the challenges of labeling negative samples and limited labeled data. The semi-supervised K-means algorithm is proposed to divide all data into three parts. The Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM) with hyperparameters optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to assess the lightning risk. The proposed method has better performance than the standard SVM and neural network (NN). Moreover, previous researches did not consider lightning protection ability. This paper introduces the receptor number into lightning risk assessment. The assessment results suggest that there is higher lightning risk in areas with a great number of wind turbines, high lightning density, and strong lightning strength. The ocean area is more likely to have low lightning risk. The results are valuable for lightning protection optimization of existing wind farms and can give guidance for the plan of new wind farms.

The impact of the Omicron variant virus reservoir has been analysed. The basic reproduction number (R-0) of the system at the disease-free equilibrium for all positive parameters has been discussed. An analysis of local and global stability under various conditions at disease-free and endemic equilibrium points has been conducted. The sensitivity analysis is performed and the most sensitive parameter of the system is identified. On the basis of the effect of various parameters on the system, we perform numerical simulation of the Omicron variant system in Indian population.

AB The majority of technological processes include dynamic systems, which are characterized by structural and parameter uncertainty. Conventional control procedures based on such models are unlikely to produce the desired performance since deterministic models cannot appropriately characterize these uncertainties. When dealing with complex nonlinear systems that are characterized by ill-defined and unknown elements, fuzzy-logic based system is an effective method. Fuzzy controllers-whose rule basis is built on the expertise of human experts-are frequently utilized in this context to achieve desired performance. This knowledge might not be adequate for some complex processes, thus different methods for creating IF-THEN rules have been suggested. In this paper, the design of higher-order fuzzy sets is discussed and a generalized novel algorithm is developed for implementing type-n fuzzy sets and it is applied for controlling the angle of steering for a vehicle in such a way that the vehicle tracks the desired path. In the proposed methodology, fuzzification and defuzzification are taking place n number of times, and defuzzification of higher order fuzzy values up to type-1 fuzzy set is performed using the center of gravity method. The obtained type-1 fuzzy values are used in the rule base and inference mechanism for calculating the final crisp output. The significance of the present research is that the computation cost is not as high as expected because both fuzzification and defuzzification processes are recursive and the reduced new type-1 fuzzy values have the additional ability to model the uncertainty and vagueness as compared to normal type-1 fuzzy values. A comparison of the controllers based on the type of fuzzy sets is done based on the square of error (SE). Both the disturbance signal and uncertainty scenarios were also considered. The use of higher-order fuzzy sets facilitates the controller to give the more accurate results for controlling the vehicle and the corresponding simulation results suggest the same.

AB One main challenge in multi-objective Bayesian optimization of expensive problems is that only a very limited number of fitness evaluations can be afforded. To address the above challenge, this article introduces multisource online transfer learning into an evolutionary multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm, facilitating the use of knowledge transferred from multiple computationally cheap problems. According to the dominance relationships of the solutions in the cheap and expensive problems, the source selection and style transfer mapping in online transfer learning are adopted to augment the data for training the Gaussian processes for the expensive problems, in which an adaptive online multisource transfer learning method is proposed based on the relationship between the balance factor parameter and the transfer mapping method. Comparative studies on two sets of widely used multi-objective optimization benchmark problems, two sets of multi-task optimization problems, and one real-world expensive optimization problem confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require continuous interaction with the controlled plant to optimize the objective function and control policy. However, the security risk and poor real-time performance limit the application of RL algorithms. In this article, a data generation feedback relearning (DGFR) control algorithm is developed to avoid these limitations. The DGFR control algorithm improves the control performance by interacting with a proposed delayed neural network-based data generation model. Considering the time-delay characteristics of industrial production, the data generation model is different from the identifier of the system model, but it is used to generate the target data required by the DGFR control algorithm. The interaction between the algorithm and the data generation model avoids the risk of trial-and-error and improves real-time performance. Finally, the superiority of the proposed control algorithm is verified by giving comparative experiments in conjunction with a power grid system and a permanent magnet synchronous motor system.

AB In this paper, we contribute to the study of coupled neural network systems controlled by event-triggered impulses. Based on the characteristics and theorems of coupled neural networks, a novel set of coupled system models and controllers are established, which differs from previous studies in that we pay attention to the drive transmission time-delay and thus focus more on the time when the impulsive control actually occurs. In addition, we propose a convergent limit averaging study approach to investigate the system and obtain certain sufficient conditions for the stabilization and synchronization of the coupled network systems under the action of stable and unstable impulses by employing Halanay differential inequalities under the designed event-triggered feedback impulse controller. Finally, several numerical simulation examples are given to show the realism of the results we obtained.

AB Research on empathy has been surging in popularity in the engineering design community since empathy is known to help designers develop a deeper understanding of the users' needs. Because of this, the design community has become more invested in devising and assessing empathic design activities. However, research on empathy has been primarily limited to individuals, meaning we do not know how it impacts team performance, particularly in the concept generation and selection stages of the design process. Specifically, it is unknown how the empathic composition of teams, defined here as the average (elevation) and standard deviation (diversity) of team members' empathy, would impact design outcomes during nominal group concept generation and early concept screening. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to investigate the impact of team empathy on nominal group concept generation and early concept screening in an engineering design student project. This was accomplished through a computational simulation of 13,482 teams of non-interacting brainstorming individuals generated by a statistical bootstrapping technique. This simulation drew upon a design repository of 806 ideas generated by first-year engineering students. The main findings from the study indicated that the impact of the elevation and diversity of different components of team empathy varied depending upon the specific design outcome (number of ideas, overall creativity, elegance, usefulness, uniqueness) and design stage (concept generation and concept screening). The results from this study can be used to guide team formation in engineering design.

AB This paper focuses attention on the problem of supporting multidimensional big data analytics tools over Big Web Knowledge Bases. These big data repositories are generated from web systems built on top of big datasets, as in several real-life examples such as web interfaces to social networks, e-government systems, smart city tools (e.g., for weather forecasting), and so forth. The problem of extracting actionable knowledge insights from big web knowledge bases is a relevant challenge now. In line with this emerging research field, the paper proposes models, issues and research trends in the context of multidimensional big data analytics over big web knowledge bases, along with a reference architecture that impersonates this paradigm.

AB Drug-target interaction (DTI) is a critical and complex process that plays a vital role in drug discovery and design. In deep learning-based DTI methods, graph neural networks (GNNs) are employed for drug molecule modeling, attention mechanisms are utilized to simulate the interaction between drugs and targets. However, existing methods still face two limitations in these aspects. First, GNN primarily focus on local neighboring nodes, making it difficult to capture the global 3D structure and edge information. Second, the current attention-based methods for modeling drug-target interactions lack interpretability and do not fully utilize the deep representations of drugs and targets. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an interpretable network architecture called CSDTI. It utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to capture the interaction features between drugs and targets. Meanwhile, we design a drug molecule aggregator to capture high-order dependencies within the drug molecular graph. These features are then utilized simultaneously for downstream tasks. Through rigorous experiments, we have demonstrated that CSDTI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance metrics such as AUC, precision, and recall in DTI prediction tasks. Furthermore, the visualization mapping of attention weights indicates that CSDTI can provide chemical insights even without external knowledge.

AB Alzheimer's disease, often known as dementia, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that causes irreversible memory loss by destroying brain cells. People die because there is no specific treatment for this disease. Alzheimer's is most common among seniors 65 years and older. However, the progress of this disease can be reduced if it can be diagnosed earlier. Recently, artificial intelligence has instilled hope in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by performing sophisticated analyses on extensive patient datasets, enabling the identification of subtle patterns that may elude human experts. Researchers have investigated various deep learning and machine learning models to diagnose this disease at an early stage using image datasets. In this paper, a new Deep learning (DL) methodology is proposed, where MRI images are fed into the model after applying various pre-processing techniques. The proposed Alzheimer's disease detection approach adopts transfer learning for multi-class classification using brain MRIs. The MRI Images are classified into four categories: mild dementia (MD), moderate dementia (MOD), very mild dementia (VMD), and non-dementia (ND). The model is implemented and extensive performance analysis is performed. The finding shows that the model obtains 97.31% accuracy. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

AB Blind image deblurring (BID) has been extensively studied in computer vision and adjacent fields. Modern methods for BID can be grouped into two categories: single-instance methods that deal with individual instances using statistical inference and numerical optimization, and data-driven methods that train deep-learning models to deblur future instances directly. Data-driven methods can be free from the difficulty in deriving accurate blur models, but are fundamentally limited by the diversity and quality of the training data-collecting sufficiently expressive and realistic training data is a standing challenge. In this paper, we focus on single-instance methods that remain competitive and indispensable. However, most such methods do not prescribe how to deal with unknown kernel size and substantial noise, precluding practical deployment. Indeed, we show that several state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-instance methods are unstable when the kernel size is overspecified, and/or the noise level is high. On the positive side, we propose a practical BID method that is stable against both, the first of its kind. Our method builds on the recent ideas of solving inverse problems by integrating physical models and structured deep neural networks, without extra training data. We introduce several crucial modifications to achieve the desired stability. Extensive empirical tests on standard synthetic datasets, as well as real-world NTIRE2020 and RealBlur datasets, show the superior effectiveness and practicality of our BID method compared to SOTA single-instance as well as data-driven methods. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/sun-umn/Blind-Image-Deblurring.

AB A growing number of medical records are changed by the electronic folders that can be shared and transmitted in real-time in recent years as a result of the speedy improvement of data mechanisms and network methodologies. Yet, security breaches and privacy issues could affect medical data sent over open communication channels. Due to its distinctive qualities including immutability, blockchain technology, anonymity, decentralization, and, verifiability has drawn more notice in various fields. With a variety of multimedia techniques, healthcare organizations all over the globe are evolving into more user-centered, harmonized, and effective models. The management of enormous amounts of information, like records and photographs of all the individual improve the person's labor requirements and the security hazards. Recent advances in the healthcare industry have led to the creation of enormous numbers of electronic health records (EHRs). The owner of the data can manage the EHR data and share thanks with certain individuals in the EHR system. It is challenging for information to guarantee protection and detection procedures due to the enormous amount of information in the medical care models. Hence, in order to secure the EHR, the development of artificial intelligence techniques like blockchain and a new privacy preservation model is recommended for this work. Particularly, the Merkle tree is a key component of blockchain technology. In this proposed model, the Merkle tree is applied that helps for effective and safe authentication of huge data frameworks with the purpose of verifiability of the posted patient data. This model consists of two main phases, such as data sanitization and data restoration. Here, the sanitization operation is based on the creation of the optimal key using a new iteration-based firefly reptile search algorithm (IFRSA). The creation of the optimal key is established by functioning a multi-objective function which includes the factors like Euclidean distance, hiding ratio, and, data preservation ratio among encrypted data using the original key and the key with a variation. Finally, the electronic health care model becomes more private, dependable, and helpful through our suggested system. The comparison shows the supremacy of the developed approach.

AB In many fields, the interpretability of machine learning models holds equal importance to their prediction accuracy. Highly accurate predictions are possible with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, but its application in high-risk fields is constrained by its lack of interpretability. To solve this issue, this paper introduces an MLP with a presingle-connection layer (SMLP). The SMLP incorporates a single-to-single connection layer with the ReLU function before the original MLP. By examining the weights of the single-connection layer after training the model, the significance of the input features can be determined. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can accurately measure the feature importance with the MLP. It offers advantages such as a straightforward theory, practical implementation, strong stability, and high reliability when compared with other widely used feature importance algorithms. Moreover, this measure effectively reveals the black box of the MLP, indicates the influence of input features on the prediction, and provides a quantitative standard for feature selection in MLP.

   language generation; Large language models; ChatGPT
AB Recent advances in natural language generation (NLG), such as public accessibility to ChatGPT, have sparked polarised debates about the societal impact of this technology. Popular discourse tends towards either overoptimistic hype that touts the radically transformative potentials of these systems or pessimistic critique of their technical limitations and general 'stupidity'. Surprisingly, these debates have largely overlooked the exegetical capacities of these systems, which for many users seem to be producing meaningful texts. In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach that combines hermeneutics-the study of meaning and interpretation-with prompt engineering-task descriptions embedded in input to NLG systems-to study the extent to which a specific NLG system, ChatGPT, produces texts of hermeneutic value. We design prompts with the goal of optimising hermeneuticity rather than mere factual accuracy, and apply them in four different use cases combining humans and ChatGPT as readers and writers. In most cases, ChatGPT produces readable texts that respond clearly to our requests. However, increasing the specificity of prompts' task descriptions leads to texts with intensified neutrality, indicating that ChatGPT's optimisation for factual accuracy may actually be detrimental to the hermeneuticity of its output.

AB In informationally mature societies, almost all organisations record, generate, process, use, share and disseminate data. In particular, the rise of AI and autonomous systems has corresponded to an improvement in computational power and in solving complex problems. However, the resulting possibilities have been coupled with an upsurge of ethical risks. To avoid the misuse, underuse, and harmful use of data and data-based systems like AI, we should use an ethical framework appropriate to the object of its reasoning. Unfortunately, in recent years, the space for data-related ethics has not been precisely defined in organisations. As a consequence, there has been an overlapping of responsibilities and a void of clear accountabilities. Ethical issues have, therefore, been dealt with using inadequate levels of abstraction (e.g. legal, technical). Yet, if building an ethical infrastructure requires the collaboration of each body, addressing ethical issues related to data requires leaving room for the appropriate level of abstraction. This paper first aims to show how the space of data ethics is already latent in organisations. It then highlights how to redefine roles (chief data ethics officer, data ethics committee, etc.) and codes (code of data ethics) to create and maintain an environment where ethical reasoning about data, information, and AI systems may flourish.

AB Body fluid biomarkers are very important, because they can be detected in a non-invasive or minimally invasive way. The discovery of secreted proteins in human body fluids is an essential step toward proteomic biomarker identification for human diseases. Recently, many computational methods have been proposed to predict secreted proteins and achieved some success. However, most of them are based on a manual negative dataset, which is usually biased and therefore limits the prediction performances. In this paper, we first propose a novel positive-unlabeled learning framework to predict secreted proteins in a single body fluid. The secreted protein discovery in a single body fluid is transformed into multiple binary classifications and solved via multi-task learning. Also, an effective convolutional neural network is employed to reduce the overfitting problem. After that, we then improve this framework to predict secreted proteins in multiple body fluids simultaneously. The improved framework adopts a globally shared network to further improve the prediction performances of all body fluids. The improved framework was trained and evaluated on datasets of 17 body fluids, and the average benchmarks of 17 body fluids achieved an accuracy of 89.48%, F1 score of 56.17%, and PRAUC of 58.93%. The comparative results demonstrate that the improved framework performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods in secreted protein discovery.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Imbalanced data classification; Focal loss; Asymmetric focal loss;
   Gradient penalty; Pulsar candidate identification
AB Model bias is a tricky problem in imbalanced data classification. An asymmetric gradient penalty method is proposed based on the power exponential function to alleviate this. The methodology integrates a power exponential function as a moderator into the cross-entropy loss of the negative samples, driving the model to focus on hesitant samples while ignoring easy and singular samples. The rationality of the algorithm is explored from the gradient point of view, and it is demonstrated that the approach improves focal loss and asymmetric focal loss. Then, the imbalanced data classification experiments were deployed on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Caltech101, respectively. For binary classification, datasets with several imbalance ratios constituted by varying the sample size of the majority class and minority class are included in the experiments. In the multi-category classification experiments, we discuss imbalanced datasets with only a single majority category and those with several majority categories and examine step-imbalance datasets and linear-imbalance datasets. The results reveal that the proposed method exhibits competitiveness on various imbalanced datasets and better robustness on high imbalance ratio datasets. Finally, the approach is deployed on the pulsar candidate dataset HTRU, and the state-of-the-art results are yielded. Our code is available at https://github.com/gzmtzly/GPPE.

AB Mechanical system fault diagnosis is essential to save costs and ensure safety. Generally, rotating machinery operates in nonstationary cases, which makes fault features complex and difficult to identify. However, existing fault diagnosis methods have the following limitations. (1) Consider only time or frequency domain features fusion. (2) Extract the fusion features representation only in the Euclidean domain. Based on that, a novel method based on multisensory time-frequency features fusion and graph attention network is proposed for rotating machinery fault diagnosis under the nonstationary case. First, the multi-sensor time series are converted into multi-sensor time-frequency maps by image-to-matrix, matrix concatenation, and matrix-to-image operations. Then, simple linear iterative clustering is applied to make the superpixels in the multi-sensor time-frequency maps into nodes and form graphs based on color and texture features. Finally, the graph attention network with residual connection is applied to distinguish the rotating machinery's health status. The proposed method is verified using gearbox test rig data and bearing public data, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can provide more reliable and accurate fault diagnosis results for rotating machinery than other methods.

Also needed is an ability to predict how people adapt their behavior in response to an agent's actions. We propose a new approach based on computational rationality, which models humans based on the idea that predictions can be derived by calculating policies that are approximately optimal given human-like bounds. Computational rationality brings together reinforcement learning and cognitive modeling in pursuit of this goal, facilitating machine understanding of humans.

AB Deep-learning-based fault diagnosis of wind turbine has played a significant role in advancing the renewable energy industry. However, the imbalanced data sampled by the supervisory control and data acquisition systems has led to low diagnosis accuracy. Additionally, deep neural networks can encounter issues like gradient vanishing and insufficient feature learning during backpropagation when the model is too deep. This article introduces a novel approach that is based on dynamic weight loss functions to modulate unbalanced data and improve diagnostic accuracy by focusing on misclassification of a small sample number. The proposed approach employs a 1D-CNN model and an ensemble-learning-based convolution neural network (EL-CNN) to enhance diversity of models and complementarity of feature learning. The EL-CNN model addresses the problem of local features being overlooked and provides more accurate results. The effectiveness of this proposed approach is well demonstrated through experimental cases on real wind turbine pitch system fault data. Two different networks using three different loss functions and three state-of-the-art fault diagnosis models are tested, demonstrating the EL-CNN model's superiority.

AB Over the past few decades, the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) has gained considerable attention in both research and industry. In particular, the healthcare sector has witnessed a surge in the use of AI applications, as the maturity of these methods increased. However, as the use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare continues to grow, we believe it will become increasingly important to examine public perceptions of this trend to identify potential impediments and future directions. Current work focuses mainly on academic data sources and industrial applications of AI. However, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the increased societal interest in AI, digital media such as podcasts should be consulted, as they are accessible to a broader audience. In order to examine this hypothesis, we investigate the AI trend development in healthcare from 2015 until 2021. In this study, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of 29 healthcare podcasts with 3449 episodes. We identify 102 AI-related buzzwords that were extracted from various glossaries and hype cycles. These buzzwords were used to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. We successfully detect an AI trend and follow its evolution in healthcare podcasts over several years. Besides the focus area of AI, we are able to detect 14 topic clusters and visualize the trending or decreasing dominant topics over the whole period under consideration. In addition, we analyze the sentiments in podcasts towards the identified topics and deliver further insights for trend detection in healthcare. Finally, the collected data set can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering.

AB The current work is to design a novel neuro-swarming computational approach for numerical treatment of mosquito dispersal system based on the heterogeneous environment by functioning the approximation capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs), global search exploitation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) together with speedy local search with interior-point (IP), i.e., ANN-PSOIP approach. In the designed ANN-PSOIP approach, the construction of objective/merit function is conducted by defining a mean square error function with continuous mapping in terms of differential models of ANNs for governing ODEs of mosquito dispersal systems and these trained nets are proficient initially with PSO and final with IP approach. The precision, correctness, stability and reliability of the proposed ANN-PSOIP approach is accredited via comparative trainings with the Runge-Kutta scheme. The obtained valuations further authenticate the accuracy as well as convergence of the designed ANN-PSOIP.

AB In this article, an adaptive neural network (NN) control problem is studied for nonstrict-feedback multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with unmeasurable states and unknown hysteresis. Firstly, to estimate the unmeasurable states, a NN state observer is constructed. Additionally, the unknown nonlinear terms are online approximated by using radial basis function-neural networks (RBF-NNs). And then, the complexity problem is addressed by using the dynamic surface control (DSC), which is easy to overcome the problem of repeated differentiations for virtual control signals. Furthermore, a nonlinear gain feedback function is introduced into the backstepping design procedure to improve the dynamic performance of the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, to satisfy the practical engineering application, a prescribed performance control (PPC) technique is implemented to guarantee the tracking error can converge to a preassigned area. By using the proposed control scheme, all closed-loop signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). At last, the preponderance and usefulness of the proposed controller are indicated by simulation results.

ID ALGORITHM; EVOLUTION
AB Aquila optimizer (AO) is a nascent meta-heuristic algorithm that draws its inspiration from the four distinct hunting strategies employed by Aquila in nature.While prior research has demonstrated that AO performs admirably on numerous optimization cases, the algorithm faces significant challenges when confronted with complex multidimensional optimization problems. Specifically, unbalanced exploration and development, inefficiency in identifying optimal solutions, and premature convergence all present significant obstacles to the algorithm's performance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel spiral aquila optimizer based on dynamic Gaussian mutation (SGAO). The algorithm introduces a novel nonlinear control factor and combines it with the spiral search strategy derived from the whale optimization algorithm, thereby accelerating the convergence speed of the algorithm. Additionally, to enhance the probability of escaping local optima in the AO, Gaussian mutant solutions are generated using the positional information of the current new particle and the best particle. Diverging from other improved versions of AO, this research analyzes the motion patterns of traditional AO and purposefully introduces fresh optimization approach, enabling the proposed SGAO to exhibit exceptional performance. In order to validate the efficacy of the proposed method, the newly developed SGAO is subjected to extensive simulation experiments across 39 benchmark problems and five engineering application problems, and is compared against other advanced meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that SGAO significantly outperforms traditional AO and other advanced meta-heuristic algorithms, exhibiting exceptional performance and competitiveness.

TI Effective reversible data hiding scheme for interpolated images using an

DT Article; Early Access
DE Reversible data hiding; Interpolation technology; Data encoding
ID PAYLOAD
AB In 2021, Lu et al. proposed a reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme for interpolated images based on a multilayer centerfolding strategy with a high embedding rate and image quality. However, their data encoding method and the chosen block size are not optimal, leaving the watermarked image quality and the embedding rate to be improved. To further reduce the distortion caused by embedded data, we propose an improved RDH scheme for interpolated images using an improved data encoding method. First, an improved two-layer data encoding method is proposed, which encodes the original data R by comparing the amplitude of R and its complement and the center folding strategy to form a new encoding pair (R, F). Thereafter, the neighbor mean interpolation method proposed by Jung and Yoo is used to generate an interpolated image divided into mxm non-overlapping blocks. Additionally, the interpolated pixels in each block are pre-processed to solve the overflow/underflow problem. Finally, the encoded data R and F are embedded into the pre-processed interpolated pixels to achieve blind extraction. We theoretically prove that the image quality obtained with a block size of 2 x 2 is superior to that of many other blocks. The results of extensive experiments on the BossBase, BOWS-2, NCID, and SIPI databases confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms several state-of-the-art schemes, with the average PSNR value improved by similar to 7.58 dB when 3-bit data are embedded into each interpolated pixel. These results indicate that our proposed scheme is effective.

AB Due to the multimodal nature of real-world optimization problems, in recent years, there has been a great interest in multi-modal optimization algorithms. Multimodal optimization problems involve identifying multiple local/global optima. Niching techniques have been widely used to tackle multi-modal optimization problems. Most of the existing niching methods either require predefined niching parameters or extra information about the problem space. This paper presents a novel multimodal algorithm based on Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, which is constructed using the Fitness-Distance Balance (FDB) selection method. The purpose of applying the FDB selection method is to discover local/global optima with high potential as a fitness value along with the appropriate distance from solution candidates. Also, a local search scheme is used to enhance the convergence speed of the algorithm. Niching is a technique used in multimodal optimization to maintain diversity among multiple solutions in the population. The minimum distance between the solutions is called a "niche". The proper niching radius is the main challenge for existing approaches. Knowing the problem space helps determine the niche radius. This paper proposes a new multimodal optimization scheme that does not require prior knowledge of the problem space or the niching parameter. Seven state-of-the-art multi-modal optimization algorithms are compared to the multi-modal butterfly optimization algorithm (MBOA) on 16 benchmarks from the CEC 2013 and CEC 2015 competitions to evaluate its performance. Success rate, Number of function evaluations, Success performance, average number of optima found, Success accuracy, Maximum peak ratio, and Run-time performance criteria were measured over 25 runs to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that MBOA outperforms other algorithms according to most of the performance criteria.

TI Class imbalance mitigation: A select-then-extract learning framework for

DT Article
DE Emotion-cause pairs ' extraction; Extractive document summarization;
   Class imbalance; Cooperative graph network
AB The class imbalance problem arises in the current end-to-end models for the emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) task, and a large number of negative clause pairs interfere model to depict the characteristics of emotion and cause. Most existing methods adopt a window-constrained strategy to limit the relative distance between candidate clauses to a smaller range to filter negative pairs. However, those methods ignore the semantic association between distant clauses, and using an artificial window size is imperfect due to the inherent ambiguity and delicacy of emotion. Inspired by the centrality principle of discourse, in this paper we propose a select-thenextract framework for the ECPE task, where the core clauses are first selected from the original document as candidate emotion and cause clauses, and then emotions, causes and emotion-cause pairs are jointly extracted from the candidate clauses. Specifically, our model includes two main components: core clause selector and emotion-cause pairs extractor. For the Core Clause Selector, we introduce the extractive document summarization (EDS) task and present a multi-granularity semantic awareness cooperative graph model (MGCOG) to extract core clauses from documents. Compared to the previous methods, the core clause selector is more effective for alleviating the category imbalance because the global causal cues and context can be captured by learning global keywords and inter-clause relationships, which determines more efficient candidate clauses. For Emotion-Cause Pairs Extractor, we put forward a multi-task learning model to jointly extract emotions, causes and emotion-cause pairs from the selected core clauses. Here, a multi-head attention is used to further model the relationship between candidate clauses, and a co-predictor is designed for assigning scores to all possible emotion-cause pairs. We further investigate the pipeline and the joint model under the select-then-extract framework, and show that the experimental results on benchmark datasets are consistently superior to the comparative baseline models. Extensive ablation experiments also verify the effectiveness of each component.

DE Agricultural text classification; Very large pre-trained language model;
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT); ChatGPT; GPT-4
AB In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a vast amount of agricultural news text is posted online, accu-mulating significant agricultural knowledge. To efficiently access this knowledge, effective text classification techniques are urgently needed. Deep learning approaches, such as fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown remarkable performance gains. Nonetheless, these methods face several complex challenges, including limited agricultural training data, poor domain transferability (especially across languages), and complex and expensive deployment of large models. Inspired by the success of recent ChatGPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), this work explores the potential of applying ChatGPT in the field of agricultural informatization. Various crucial factors, such as prompt construction, answer parsing, and different ChatGPT variants, are thoroughly investigated to maximize its capabilities. A preliminary comparative study is conducted, comparing ChatGPT with PLMs-based fine-tuning methods and PLMs-based prompt-tuning methods. Empirical results demonstrate that ChatGPT effectively addresses the mentioned research challenges and bottlenecks, making it an ideal solution for agricultural text classification. Moreover, ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to existing PLM-based fine-tuning methods, even without fine-tuning on agricultural data samples. We hope this preliminary study could inspire the emergence of a general-purpose AI paradigm for agricultural text processing.

AB In the process industries, the complex mechanisms, the many variables with complex interactions, the high uncertainty and errors in instrumentation, etc. make it very difficult to build accurate soft sensor models. Domain knowledge plays a very important role in soft sensor modeling. However, current data-driven methods lack domain knowledge of the specific processes. Therefore, a spatio-temporal deep learning soft sensor modeling framework embedded with domain knowledge is proposed in this paper. First, the time-delays between the key variable and the other process variables are analyzed to align the process variables temporally and select secondary variables. A spatio-temporal structure model (STSM) of the process is then constructed by using domain knowledge to decouple the sub-processes. Finally, a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model embedded with the STSM is proposed to learn the characteristics of the spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamic features between the sub-process variables and the key variable in industrial processes. The effectiveness of the framework is verified by prediction of the key indices in two mineral processing processes.

ID REDUCTION
AB In the arena of digital image processing, mixed noise is normally depicted. Nevertheless, the main limitation of the existing noise removal methods is the exploitation of the statistics of the original contaminated image. Concerns such as high computational complexity, halo artifacts and over-saturation issue are presented in the edges of the noisy images i.e. high-frequency components of the mixed noise digital images which lead to false guesstimate of noisy patches that negatively results on the task of recovery processes of the restoration images. This paper proposes a rapid and high accurate mixed noise removal method by combining pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) and regularization of Perona-Malik equation (P-M equation) in order to remove unwanted contamination. In this regard, the locations of impulse noise are positioned using PCNN, the second-generation wavelet filter is used to suppress the mixed noise into small local neighborhood, and then the full noisy image is denoised by exploiting the regularization of P-M equation. The fine details and sharp edges are well preserved in the proposed method. In addition, subjective and objective analyses are showed that the visual quality of the proposed mixed noise removal technique outperformed state of the art noise removal methods. Extensive results show that the proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art mixed noise removal techniques, with PSNR improvements of (0.85 dB to 1.54 dB) and SSIM improvements range of (0.0132-0.1521). Moreover, improvements in running time of the proposed technique was the second best technique with improvements range of (0.33-0.56 s) on wide range of benchmark digital images.

AB Charge-trapping tunnel field effect transistors (CT-TFETs) are experimentally demonstrated, and their array operations are discussed for low-power large-scale neuromorphic applications. CT-TFETs cointegrated with charge-trapping metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (CT-MOSFETs) through complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic process exhibit & AP;2,000x lower on-current (Ion) and & AP;3,000x lower off-current (Ioff) than CT-MOSFETs, rendering them suitable for high-accuracy large-scale neuromorphic systems. According to the experimental and simulation results, CT-TFETs outperform CT-MOSFETs in terms of more accurate analog vector-matrix multiplication than that of CT-MOSFETs due to the following two reasons: first, CT-TFETs feature a lower voltage (IR) drop resulting from lower Ion than that of CT-MOSFETs. Second, the former is more robust to the IR drops than the latter due to weak channel length modulation. For example, unlike CT-MOSFETs, the proposed CT-TFETs exhibit ignorable weight degradation in spite of the 1 & omega; wire resistance. CT-TFET arrays show & AP;700x lower power consumption and & AP;10% higher MNIST classification accuracy than CT-MOSFET arrays, making CT-TFET arrays promising for extensive and versatile neuromorphic computing applications.
   Charge-trapping tunnel field effect transistors (CT-TFETs) have been explored for their potential to implement energy-efficient large-scale neuromorphic arrays. This study compares CT-TFET and CT-MOSFET arrays in terms of accuracy, power consumption, and lower voltage (IR) drop immunity for vector-matrix multiplication operations. These findings demonstrate that CT-TFETs outperform CT-MOSFETs, enabling accurate analog computations, lower power consumption, and robustness against IR drops, making them suitable for large-scale neuromorphic applications.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a widely used metaheuristic for addressing challenging optimization problems. Selecting suitable settings for GA parameters can lead to a considerable improvement in its performance, but this is often difficult due to the larger number of alternatives available and variable performance depending on the problem solved. Furthermore, consideration of multiple performance criteria in parameter selection adds an additional layer of complexity. Therefore, practitioners often rely on their previous experiences or perform trial-and-error experiments when determining suitable parameter settings. In this study, we define the problem of finding suitable settings for GAs as a bi-objective optimization problem with an aim to find efficient settings that will maximize the approximation quality and minimize the run time of the GA. We conduct an empirical study on a GA that solves Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Two evolutionary algorithms are utilized in a nested manner to address the bi-objective parameter setting problem: a GA to solve the TSP instances and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the bi-objective efficient settings of the GA. We find efficient settings for each instance through an empirical study with 31 TSP instances and identify settings that perform well regardless of the instance solved. The results provide valuable insights into the behavior of efficient settings, demonstrating that some operators and parameters are robust to changes in problem size, while others require adjustment.

ID BOUNDS
AB Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) utilizes shared structure among tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with only a little experience. However, most existing Meta-RL algorithms lack theoretical generalization guarantees or offer such guarantees under restrictive assumptions (e.g., strong assumptions on the data distribution). This paper for the first time conducts a theoretical analysis for estimating the generalization performance of the Meta-RL learner using the PAC-Bayesian theory. The application of PAC-Bayesian theory to Meta-RL poses a challenge due to the existence of dependencies in the training data, which renders the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption invalid. To address this challenge, we propose a dependency graph-based offline decomposition (DGOD) approach, which decomposes non-i.i.d. Meta-RL data into multiple offline i.i.d. datasets by utilizing the techniques of offline sampling and graph decomposition. With the DGOD approach, we derive the practical PAC-Bayesian offline Meta-RL generalization bounds and design an algorithm with generalization guarantees to optimize them, called PAC-Bayesian Offline Meta-Actor-Critic (PBOMAC). The results of experiments conducted on several challenging Meta-RL benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm performs well in avoiding meta-overfitting and outperforms recent state-of-the-art Meta-RL algorithms without generalization bounds.

AB Extreme learning machines (ELM) have been applied in several fields due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, ELM hurts the performance in cross-domain learning problems similar to most machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we mainly focus on the semi-supervised transfer learning algorithm under ELM framework. Unlike other transfer learning methods employed both source and target domains, we propose a target adaptive ELM (TAELM) of learning a high-quality target-specific classifier with less resources. We formulate a novel objective function to obtain a target-specific classifier by introducing a knowledge transfer term on a pre-trained source model and a graph laplacian-based manifold regularization term on the target domain, while its solution are analytically determined without loss of the computing efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by using a deep neural network model as feature extractor for both domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method with less resources significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH
AB In this paper, a hybrid algorithm called rough sine cosine algorithm (RSCA) is introduced for solving engineering optimization problems by merging the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) with the rough set theory concepts (RST). RSCA combines the benefits of SCA and RST to focus the search for a promising region where the global solution can be found. Due to imprecise information on the optimization problems, efficient algorithms roughly identify the optimal solution for this type of uncertain data. The fundamental motive for adding the RST is to deal with the imprecision and roughness of the available information regarding the global optimal, especially for large dimensional problems. The cut concept of RST targeted the more interesting search region so the optimal operation could be sped up, and the global optimum could be reached at a low computational cost. The proposed RSCA algorithm is tested on 23 benchmark functions and 3 design problems. RSCA's obtained results are mainly compared to the SCA, which is used as a first level of the proposed algorithm in this work and those of other algorithms in the literature. According to the comparisons, the RSCA can provide very competitive performance with different algorithms.

AB Internal burnishing operation is a prominent solution to improve the hole quality. In this study, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) system parameters, including the diameter of the nozzle (N), impingement angle (I), the pressure of the compressed air (P), the flow rate of the lubricant (L), and the distance between the nozzle and workpiece (D) are optimized for decreasing the total energy consumption (TE), average surface roughness (AR), and air quality indicator (AI) of the internal roller burnishing process. The predictive models of performance measures were developed using the adaptive neuro-based-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach, while a novel model is developed to compute the total burnishing cost (BC). The neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm (NCGA) and the VIKOR method were used to generate a set of prominent solutions and determine the best selection. The outcomes presented that the optimizing values of the N, I, P, L, and D are 1.0 mm, 35 deg., 0.3 MPa, 70 ml/h, and 10 mm, respectively. The TE, AI, AR, and BC are decreased by 3.1, 9.3, 20.6, and 7.9%, respectively, at the chosen point. The proposed performance measures could be utilized to precisely forecast the responses in the practical burnishing. The developed optimizing method combining the ANFIS, NCGA, and VIKOR could be effectively utilized to deal with complicated optimization issues for machining operations. The observed findings provided efficient information, which could help machine operators to select the optimal MQL system parameters and enhance the burnishing performances.

ID DOCUMENT; PERFORMANCE
AB The Tamizhi inscriptions, one of the earliest ever discovered, is predominantly found on memorial stones and caves which dates 5th century BCE to 3rd century CE. Today's generations need ways to interpret the script in order to know the historical figures and events because the Tamizhi script evolved into the modern Tamil script over time. Currently, only few epigraphists are available to manually decode the inscriptions into modern Tamil. Hence, there is a need for an alternate way to preserve this cultural heritage. Image processing is one such digital technology that enables binarization on inscription images, and the retrieved text may then be utilized to convert them to the needed target language. Nevertheless, binarization of Tamizhi inscription images are highly complex due to aging, environmental factors, handwritten, similar foreground & background and uneven size and shapes of the stones. Also, due to the small dataset, deep learning techniques are inapplicable. Furthermore, existing approaches produce poor results for Tamizhi inscriptions since they can only be used on flat stone backgrounds and require sufficient light illumination for effective binarization. This research suggests a multi-level improvised binarization solution for Tamizhi inscription images to address these challenges. It achieves this utilizing post-processing with shrink and swell filters together with an improved median filter with modified adaptive thresholding. Outperforming the current binarization techniques, which achieved a maximum accuracy of about 74%, MLIBT produced an accuracy of around 92.19%.

AB This study proposes an application of cognitive maps in the representation of cognitive structures of the experts and assessment of their development/modification as a result of a (computer or expert system-assisted) learning process. It strives to identify information needed for the guidance of the process of creation and management of expert knowledge by formal modeling tools. Changes in experts' cognitive structures are assumed to stem from individual and collaborative (group-level) learning. The novel approach to assessing the outcomes of learning reflected as changes in the cognitive structures of experts or groups of experts, modeled by cognitive maps, does not assume any correct or desired outcome of the learning process to be known in advance. Instead, it identifies and analyzes the changes in (or robustness of) the constituents of the cognitive maps from different points of view and allows for quantifying and visualizing the actual effect of the learning. The proposed methodology can identify changes in cognitive diversity, causal structures in terms of causal relations and concepts, and the perceived importance of strategic issues over the learning period. It can also detect which cause-effect relationships have appeared/disappeared considering the pre-/post-mapping design. Thus, it provides an exploratory account on the changes in the cognitive structures of the expert(s) as a result of learning. The applicability of the proposed methods is illustrated in the assessment of the learning outcomes of a group of 71 graduate students who participated in an eight-week business simulation task. The results of the empirical analysis confirm the viability of the proposed methodology and indicate that the students' understanding of the utilized concepts and associated relationships in the decision-making process improved throughout the learning activity, ultimately showing that the course learning has considerably improved students' perception and knowledge. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the proposed approach has the potential to be effective in assessing learning outcomes in teaching-learning activities.

AB Cross-modality image synthesis is an active research topic with multiple medical clinically relevant applica-tions. Recently, methods allowing training with paired but misaligned data have started to emerge. However, no robust and well-performing methods applicable to a wide range of real world data sets exist. In this work, we propose a generic solution to the problem of cross-modality image synthesis with paired but non-aligned data by introducing new deformation equivariance encouraging loss functions. The method consists of joint training of an image synthesis network together with separate registration networks and allows adversarial training conditioned on the input even with misaligned data. The work lowers the bar for new clinical applications by allowing effortless training of cross-modality image synthesis networks for more difficult data sets.

AB The wind resources of mountain wind farms are affected by more complex terrain than are found at flat wind farms. Wind turbine (WT) failures caused by frequent operation of the yaw system occur often in mountain wind farms, resulting in significantly reduced economic benefits over the WT life cycle. Considering the problem of frequent yaw motions of WTs in mountain wind farms, this study introduces multi-objective optimization theory into the yaw system restart strategy optimization of WTs for the first time and proposes an optimized yaw system restart strategy with wind speed segmentation in the wind speed region below the rated wind speed. The yaw behavior of mountain wind farms in southern China is analyzed from multiple perspectives; a segmentation scheme of wind speed intervals for yaw control was determined from the results. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the control parameters for each sub-interval with the goals of minimizing yaw operation time and maximizing energy generation. A set of Pareto solutions is obtained and evaluated with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to produce the optimal solution. The simulation results indicated that after the WT adopts the optimized yaw system restart strategy in the wind speed region below the rated wind speed, the number of yaw motions is decreased by 82.9%, with only a slight decrease in energy generation. The optimization method proposed in this study can significantly reduce yaw operation time with minimal loss of energy generation, which provides a new approach to balancing the relationship between reducing the WT failure rate and ensuring power generation efficiency and is expected to significantly improve the economic benefits to wind farms.

AB Attacker probing behavior detection is a notch in the current security defense system. Most cyber-attack detection research focuses on real-time payload interception and attack source tracing. However, the defense system cannot predict the attack behavior before the attack launches and cannot provide sufficient reaction and preparation time for the network administrators. Therefore, the current security system urgently needs to be improved by detecting cyber-attack precursors. We propose a potential Web attacker identification method based on a graph attention network (PWAGAT) by studying the features of the attacker's behavior pattern before launching a Web attack. The core of PWAGAT is to identify the probing behavior of attackers and find those suspicious users with a high probability of carrying out Web attacks. The PWAGAT trains the embedding learning representation of each behavioral node from the Web attack behavior graph (WABG) through GAT and then uses the deep forest algorithm to train a classification model that recognizes probing behaviors. On the WAB-dataset provided by the Institute of Information Security of Sichuan University, the experiment proved that PWAGAT performed better than other graph learning methods in performing node embedding and classification of hacking behaviors. The results showed that identifying hacker probing behavior could help discover potential Web attackers, alerting defenders to assist in subsequent attack detection.

AB Machine vision in low-light conditions is a critical requirement for object detection in road transportation, particularly for assisted and autonomous driving scenarios. Existing vision-based techniques are limited to daylight traffic scenarios due to their reliance on adequate lighting and high frame rates. This paper presents a novel approach to tackle this problem by investigating Vehicle Detection and Localisation (VDL) in extremely low-light conditions by using a new machine learning model. Specifically, the proposed model employs two customised generative adversarial networks, based on Pix2PixGAN and CycleGAN, to enhance dark images for input into a YOLOv4-based VDL algorithm. The model's performance is thoroughly analysed and compared against the prominent models. Our findings validate that the proposed model detects and localises vehicles accurately in extremely dark images, with an additional run-time of approximately 11 ms and an accuracy improvement of 10%-50% compared to the other models. Moreover, our model demonstrates a 4%-8% increase in Intersection over Union (IoU) at a mean frame rate of 9 fps, which underscores its potential for broader applications in ubiquitous road-object detection. The results demonstrate the significance of the proposed model as an early step to overcoming the challenges of low-light vision in road-object detection and autonomous driving, paving the way for safer and more efficient transportation systems.

We propose a multi-level and joint attention (ML-Joint-Att) network to learn high-order representations of brain functional connectivities that are specific and shared across multiple tasks. We design the ML-Joint-Att network with edge and node convolutional operators, an adaptive inception module, and three attention modules, including network-wise, region-wise, and region-wise joint attention modules. The adaptive inception learns brain functional connectivity at multiple spatial scales. The network-wise and region-wise attention modules take the multi-scale functional connectivities as input and learn features at the network and regional levels for individual tasks. Moreover, the joint attention module is designed as region-wise joint attention to learn shared brain features that contribute to and compensate for the prediction of multiple tasks. We employed the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset (n = 9092) to evaluate the ML-Joint-Att network for the prediction of cognitive flexibility and inhibition. Our experiments demonstrated the usefulness of the three attention modules and identified brain functional connectivities and regions specific and common between cognitive flexibility and inhibition. In particular, the joint attention module can significantly improve the prediction of both cognitive functions. Moreover, leave one-site cross-validation showed that the ML-Joint-Att network is robust to independent samples obtained from different sites of the ABCD study. Our network outperformed existing machine learning techniques, including Brain Bias Set (BBS), spatio-temporal graph convolution network (ST-GCN), and BrainNetCNN. We demonstrated the generalization of our method to other applications, such as the prediction of fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence, which also outperformed the ST-GCN and BrainNetCNN.

AB Sparse deep neural networks have proven to be efficient for predictive model building in large-scale studies. Although several works have studied theoretical and numerical properties of sparse neural architectures, they have primarily focused on the edge selection. Sparsity through edge selection might be intuitively appealing; however, it does not necessarily reduce the structural complexity of a network. Instead pruning excessive nodes leads to a structurally sparse network with significant computational speedup during inference. To this end, we propose a Bayesian sparse solution using spike-and-slab Gaussian priors to allow for automatic node selection during training. The use of spikeand-slab prior alleviates the need of an ad-hoc thresholding rule for pruning. In addition, we adopt a variational Bayes approach to circumvent the computational challenges of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation. In the context of node selection, we establish the fundamental result of variational posterior consistency together with the characterization of prior parameters. In contrast to the previous works, our theoretical development relaxes the assumptions of the equal number of nodes and uniform bounds on all network weights, thereby accommodating sparse networks with layer-dependent node structures or coefficient bounds. With a layer-wise characterization of prior inclusion probabilities, we discuss the optimal contraction rates of the variational posterior. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the edge selection method in computational complexity with similar or better predictive performance. Our experimental evidence further substantiates that our theoretical work facilitates layer-wise optimal node recovery. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ADAPTATION
AB Legged robots that can instantly change motor patterns at different walking speeds are useful and can accomplish various tasks efficiently. However, state-of-the-art control methods either are difficult to develop or require long training times. In this study, we present a comprehensible neural control framework to integrate probability-based black-box optimization (PIBB) and supervised learning for robot motor pattern generation at various walking speeds. The control framework structure is based on a combination of a central pattern generator (CPG), a radial basis function (RBF)-based premotor network and a hypernetwork, resulting in a so-called neural CPG-RBF-hyper control network. First, the CPG-driven RBF network, acting as a complex motor pattern generator, was trained to learn policies (multiple motor patterns) for different speeds using PIBB. We also introduce an incremental learning strategy to avoid local optima. Second, the hypernetwork, which acts as a task/behavior to control parameter mapping, was trained using supervised learning. It creates a mapping between the internal CPG frequency (reflecting the walking speed) and motor behavior. This map represents the prior knowledge of the robot, which contains the optimal motor joint patterns at various CPG frequencies. Finally, when a user-defined robot walking frequency or speed is provided, the hypernetwork generates the corresponding policy for the CPG-RBF network. The result is a versatile locomotion controller which enables a quadruped robot to perform stable and robust walking at different speeds without sensory feedback. The policy of the controller was trained in the simulation (less than 1 h) and capable of transferring to a real robot. The generalization ability of the controller was demonstrated by testing the CPG frequencies that were not encountered during training.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pectus excavatum (PE) is a common congenital sternal malformation disease that significantly impacts the physical and psychological well-being of affected individuals. Traditional methods for diagnosing and correcting PE rely heavily on physician expertise, leading to potential uncertainties and errors. While current research has primarily focused on automatic indices extraction and deformity evaluation, there is a lack of emphasis on generating corrective solutions for patients with PE. To address these limitations, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approach for automatically generating recommended corrections for patients with PE. Specifically, our approach involves training a CNN model using sternum contours from normal individuals to predict corrected sternum contours for patients. Through block-wise fine-tuning using transfer learning, we optimize the regression performance for three PE indices. The complete contours of patients are then depicted based on the predicted indices using our CAD method. To validate our approach, we collected a dataset comprising 11,755 chest CT images from 40 PE patients and 40 healthy individuals. The results suggest there is no significant difference between the predicted contours generated by our model and the actual postoperative contours by skilled surgeons, underscoring the promising efficacy of our model. In summary, our novel approach goes beyond the limitations of existing techniques and offers a significant advancement in the diagnosis and correction of PE.

AB Understanding the geological information of fractures from borehole images is essential for conducting a thorough geological analysis in engineering. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been employed to extract high-level features of fractures from images. We propose an improved Faster R-CNN (region-based CNN) model for fracture detection, which is suitably equipped with a tailored region proposal network f-RPN for borehole fractures. The anchors generated by f-RPN are specifically designed with a fixed width and varying heights, and only the anchors with the maximum intersection-over-union values are labeled as positive. By taking advantage of the cyclic feature of borehole images, the images are expanded in four orientations to increase the amount and diversity of the model input. The detection results of the model can further be utilized to simplify the Hough transform for characterizing dip angles and dip directions of fractures. The proposed method is validated with borehole images from multiple projects in hydraulic engineering. Experiments reveal that the average detection accuracy is approximately 91.5%, which exhibits an improvement of 11.06% compared to the original Faster R-CNN. Further analysis indicates that both f-RPN and the multi-orientation expansion contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. It is also shown that this method demonstrates robustness against blurred image background and outperforms traditional image processing methods in the presence of noise. The fracture characterization by the simplified Hough transform turns out to be computationally efficient and accurate, with the absolute errors less than 5 degrees compared to the manual identification results.

AB Adversarial robustness is considered a required property of deep neural networks. In this study, we discover that adversarially trained models might have significantly different characteristics in terms of margin and smoothness, even though they show similar robustness. Inspired by the observation, we investigate the effect of different regularizers and discover the negative effect of the smoothness regularizer on maximizing the margin. Based on the analyses, we propose a new method called bridged adversarial training that mitigates the negative effect by bridging the gap between clean and adversarial examples. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the proposed method provides stable and better robustness, especially for large perturbations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of vanishing and exploding gradients has been a long-standing obstacle that hinders the effective training of neural networks. Despite various tricks and techniques that have been employed to alleviate the problem in practice, there still lacks satisfactory theories or provable solutions. In this paper, we address the problem from the perspective of high-dimensional probability theory. We provide a rigorous result that shows, under mild conditions, how the vanishing/exploding gradients problem disappears with high probability if the neural networks have sufficient width. Our main idea is to constrain both forward and backward signal propagation in a nonlinear neural network through a new class of activation functions, namely Gaussian-Poincare normalized functions, and orthogonal weight matrices. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our theory and confirm its effectiveness on very deep neural networks when applied in practice.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhanced Precision in Dam Crack Width Measurement: Leveraging Advanced
   Lightweight Network Identification for Pixel-Level Accuracy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

AB In dam engineering, the presence of cracks and crack width are important indicators for diagnosing the health of dams. The accurate measurement of cracks facilitates the safe use of dams. The manual detection of such defects is unsatisfactory in terms of cost, safety, accuracy, and the reliability of evaluation. The introduction of deep learning for crack detection can overcome these issues. However, the current deep learning algorithms possess a large volume of model parameters, high hardware requirements, and difficulty toward embedding in mobile devices such as drones. Therefore, we propose a lightweight MobileNetV2_DeepLabV3 image segmentation network. Furthermore, to prevent interference by noise, light, shadow, and other factors for long-length targets when segmenting, the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module parameters in the DeepLabV3+ network structure were modified, and a multifeature fusion structure was used instead of the parallel structure in ASPP, allowing the network to obtain richer crack features. We collected the images of dam cracks from different environments, established segmentation datasets, and obtained segmentation models through network training. Experiments show that the improved MobileNetV2_DeepLabV3 algorithm exhibited a higher crack segmentation accuracy than the original MobileNetV2_DeepLabV3 algorithm; the average intersection rate attained 83.23%; and the crack detail segmentation was highly accurate. Compared with other semantic segmentation networks, its training time was at least doubled, and the total parameters were reduced by more than 2 to 7 times. After extracting cracks through the semantic segmentation, we proposed to use the method of inscribed circle of crack outline to calculate the maximum width of the detected crack image and to convert it into the actual width of the crack. The maximum relative error rate was 11.22%. The results demonstrated the potential of innovative deep learning methods for dam crack detection.

AB Accurately segmenting object structures in computed tomography (CT) images is crucial for computer-aided surgery, diagnosis, and other interdisciplinary applications. Most state-of-the-art CT segmentation methods employ a classical jump structure to integrate shallow and deep feature information. However, the effectiveness of the current CT image segmentation and related subtasks must still be improved due to feature disparity between different layers and information transfer loss. To alleviate the problem, we propose a novel three-dimensional multicategory segmentation model, the weakening feature disparity transformer (FDTR), based on the transformer structure for CT imaging. Firstly, to effectively capture global features, we design a vision transformer-based encoder. Secondly, to enhance the model's information representation in a lightweight manner, we devise a nested structure of dense compression connections. Lastly, to mitigate the disparity in semantic features at shallow layers, we propose supervised semantic signals. By employing the vision transformer-based encoder and the dense connection structure, we enhance the detailed information of deep features. Additionally, the semantic supervisory signal introduces deep semantic information to the shallow features, enriching the overall feature representation. We conducted extensive experiments on the KIPA2022 dataset for multiorgan segmentation and the YC2022 dataset for volumetric trait segmentation in broiler breeding. The proposed method, FDTR, effectively enhances feature transfer between shallow and deep features, achieving optimal results compared to other advanced models and demonstrating broad prospects for application.

AB This paper is dedicated to solving the problem of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack and defense in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Due to the diversity of IIoT equipment and the inconsistency of protection capabilities, it is difficult for the existing uniform defense strategy and the random defense strategy to achieve ideal results. Considering that both attackers and defenders aim to achieve maximum benefits by paying the minimum cost, as well as the differences between devices, this paper proposes an equipment classification based differential game method for APT in IIoT. Firstly, all equipment is divided into two categories according to their protective capabilities. Secondly, the APT attack and defense process is mathematically described, and the corresponding differential game problem is formulated and analyzed theoretically. Finally, the theoretical results of this method are verified by various experiments, including the comparisons with the uniform defense strategy, the random defense strategy, and the latest model.

AB The accumulation of large amounts of historical data has led to the wide application of ensemble learning over the past few decades, but the balance between the individual accuracy of base classifiers (BCs) and the diversity among these BCs is rarely considered in the construction of ensemble models. Since such a balance is crucial to the success of ensemble models, this paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm-based sequential instance selection framework to address this research gap. The novelties of the proposed framework include: transforming the balance between the individual accuracy of BCs and the diversity among BCs into a general combinatorial optimization model and designing a Genetic Algorithm-based evolutionary instance selection method to solve this model. The proposed framework not only overcomes the inherent limitations of the Genetic Algorithm in some high-dimensional tasks but also provides an explicit and automatic way to balance the accuracy and diversity by searching appropriate training data subsets for different component BCs. Based on obtained training data subsets, the component BCs of the ensemble model are generated sequentially, and their predictions are further combined with the weighted majority voting rule. Using 30 real datasets collected from various practical applications, such as medicine, business, and industry, the effectiveness of the proposed framework in constructing powerful ensemble models is examined and compared with six benchmark ensemble learning methods. In addition, the capability of the proposed framework to improve convergence performances is also examined by the comparison with the traditional Genetic Algorithm.

AB To improve the assembly accuracy and efficiency of turbine-based combined cycle engines, we propose a multistage rotors assembly method based on augmented reality (AR) for turbine-based combined cycle engines. Combining the high fidelity interaction and edge computing capabilities of AR device, the real-time assembly guidance of multi-stage rotors of turbine-based combined cycle engine is realized. A new multi-stage rotors assembly mathematical model is proposed by introducing clearance errors to achieve prediction of coaxiality and perpendicularity in multi-stage rotors assembly. A point cloud registration method with equal-area constraints is proposed based on the requirement of AR virtual-real registration, combined with the triangulated graph. The experiment selected the multi-stage rotors of a simulated combination cycle engine for assembly. The experimental results showed that our AR system has an average delay of 11 ms and an average frame rate of 45fps. The accuracy of virtual-real registration is superior to current mainstream registration methods. The coaxiality prediction error and the perpendicularity prediction error for multi-stage rotors assembly is 0.5 & mu;m and 0.4 & mu;m, respectively. This system provides an efficient and accurate assembly plan for the rotors assembly of turbinebased combined cycle engines, meeting the actual assembly requirements on site.

ID DAMAGE DETECTION
AB Cracking is one of the typical damages in concrete structures, and it is crucial to detect and quantify cracks in a timely and efficient manner. However, current research primarily focuses on either single-task recognition or dual-task recognition based on multi-step sequential approaches. Less attention has been devoted to the multitask integration of cracks. To address the challenges of inefficient and multi-step detection in traditional concrete crack detection methods, a novel deep learning-based model, called YOLOv5-IDS, is proposed based on You Only Look Once network v5 (version 6.2) with the combination of bilateral segmentation network while introducing a dilated convolution, pyramid pooling module, and attention refinement module. Moreover, crack parameter measurement algorithms based on the micro-element method are proposed to improve accuracy and efficiency. The method proposed in this study can not only detect and segment cracks with high accuracy and efficiency, but also quickly measure crack parameters, thus developing a complete method for the process from real-time crack detection and segmentation to crack parameter measurement. The experimental results for the YOLOv5-IDS model reveal the following performance metrics. For crack detection, the mean average precision with an intersection of union threshold of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) is 84.33%, and the frames per second (FPS) is 159 f/s. For crack segmentation, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) is 94.78%, and the FPS is 8 f/s, respectively. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the calculation of crack parameters proves to be both precise and rapid.

ID ADAPTATION
AB In industrial online advertising, real-time bidding optimization has brought substantial profits. Existing methods usually set fixed bids for advertisers which causes collusion among advertisers, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this work, by considering both advertisers' and the platform's objectives, we formulate the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem and propose a neural evolutionary strategy-based framework to learn the optimal bidding strategy. Since the objectives of advertisers and the platform are conflicting to some extent, it is crucial to properly balance them. A straightforward idea is to simply add up the objectives. However, this could limit the diversity of solutions, leading to suboptimal performance. To this end, we innovatively develop a distributed dominance graph-based neural Pareto multiobjective evolutionary strategy, which can learn a better spread of solutions to improve the model performance. In addition, it can distribute the total computational cost among thousands of workers, improving computational efficiency. We conduct a suite of offline experiments as well as the standard online A/B test on the Taobao platform. The experimental results indicate that our method can significantly improve the profits of both advertisers and the platform.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI GRD-Net: Generative-Reconstructive-Discriminative Anomaly Detection with
   Region of Interest Attention Module
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Anomaly detection is nowadays increasingly used in industrial applications and processes. One of the main fields of the appliance is the visual inspection for surface anomaly detection, which aims to spot regions that deviate from regularity and consequently identify abnormal products. Defect localization is a key task that is usually achieved using a basic comparison between generated image and the original one, implementing some blob analysis or image-editing algorithms in the postprocessing step, which is very biased towards the source dataset, and they are unable to generalize. Furthermore, in industrial applications, the totality of the image is not always interesting but could be one or some regions of interest (ROIs), where only in those areas there are relevant anomalies to be spotted. For these reasons, we propose a new architecture composed by two blocks. The first block is a generative adversarial network (GAN), based on a residual autoencoder (ResAE), to perform reconstruction and denoising processes, while the second block produces image segmentation, spotting defects. This method learns from a dataset composed of good products and generated synthetic defects. The discriminative network is trained using a ROI for each image contained in the training dataset. The network will learn in which area anomalies are relevant. This approach guarantees the reduction of using preprocessing algorithms, formerly developed with blob analysis and image-editing procedures. To test our model, we used challenging MVTec anomaly detection datasets and an industrial large dataset of pharmaceutical BFS strips of vials. This set constitutes a more realistic use case of the aforementioned network.

   Complex causal extraction
AB Popular methods of causality extraction work well for simple and explicit single causal relations, but it remains challenging to extract causal relations from the complex sentences of natural texts due to ambiguity concerning the locations of the causal subject and object as well as the complexity of the relevant dependencies. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a five-tuple annotation scheme that defines a scoring function to iteratively parse out the causal pairs from multiple entity pairs in a sentence, and to thus transform the task of extracting causal relations into that of automatic annotation. First, this study uses this scheme to propose a multi-headed, self-attentive mechanism that incorporates encoded information on relative position to increase the capability of the model to perceive causal features. Second, the authors combine information from a dependency tree while assigning the appropriate weights, and finally use a bidirectional GCN network to parse the weights of features of the tree from multiple perspectives and splice the dependency-related features. This joint model of extraction improves the bounds of cause-effect pairs of entities while considering the dependency relationships between them, which renders the extracted, fine-grained causal terms more accurate. Experiments on the SemEval 2010 task 8 and the ADE datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms prevalent methods in terms of the accuracy of solving complex causal extraction compared with state-of-the-art approaches to modeling.

AB Extracting discriminative features using vision transformer is a popular research direction for person re-identification. However, feature extraction of existing vision transformer is relatively simple. To solve this problem, we design a vision transformer with multiple granularities for person re-identification. We propose three stages of multi-granularity feature extraction, including stage1 (shuffle), stage2 (split and concat) and stage3 (refine and enhance), which help the model to extract local and global fine features in strips. The highlight block is added in stage3 to enhance features by mathematical variation, which will highlight and strengthen the core features that are beneficial to classification. In addition, the loss function is optimized by introducing Circle Loss on top of ID Loss and Triplet Loss, and using the weighted sum of the three as the final loss function. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our method on three standard benchmark datasets: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17, and experimental results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, the impact of rated power and the total capacity of all photovoltaic units on the energy loss reduction of radial distribution networks is investigated. An IEEE 69-node system is supposed to be a radial distribution network in the North and South of Vietnam to take the real mean solar radiations of 1 year from the global solar map for simulation. Five study cases are implemented corresponding to the difference of rated power of five installed photovoltaic units, including optimal size and four fixed sizes of 250, 500, 750 and 1000 kW. The proposed modified slime mould algorithm (MSMA) and three other algorithms including the original Coot optimization algorithm (COA), original Transient search optimization algorithm (TSOA) and original slime mould algorithm (SMA) are used to find optimal solutions of the five study cases. As a result, MSMA is the best method for reaching smaller 1-year energy loss and finding a higher number of more effective solutions than others. In addition, the study also suggests the placement of photovoltaic units should use optimal rated power for each unit and optimal total capacity for all units rather than using the same rated power for each unit and a predetermined total capacity for all units.

AB The ratio of various types of ores on a conveyor belt indicates how well the ores are blended, which can play a crucial role in determining the quality of steel. However, the conventional method of artificial naked eye detection based on experience is risky, time-consuming, and inaccurate. To address this issue, this study proposes an automatic ore category percentage statistics method based on multiclass semantic segmentation. The first step involves creating a clean dataset comprising five different categories of ores collected at a mine site. Subsequently, a novel U-Net-based network is introduced to segment the ore images. Specifically, a pre-trained VGG16 is adopted to replace the original backbone to enhance the feature extraction ability. A pyramid pooling module is also simplified to effectively aggregate the multiscale information. In addition, a W-shaped architecture, which bridges feature maps between the first and second encoders through addition, is utilized to generate the final probability map in a predict-refine manner. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a pixel-wise accuracy of 92.45% and a mean intersection over union of 72.42%, outperforming ten other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to predict images of unprocessed ores from a mine site to determine their category proportions, thus providing valuable guidance for optimizing the ore blending process.

AB Computer vision systems are employed in a variety of high-impact applications. However, making them trustworthy requires methods for the detection of potential biases in their training data, before models learn to harm already disadvantaged groups in downstream applications. Image data are typically represented via extracted features, which can be hand-crafted or pre-trained neural network embeddings. In this work, we introduce a framework for bias discovery given such features that is based on optimal transport theory; it uses the (quadratic) Wasserstein distance to quantify disparity between the feature distributions of two demographic groups (e.g., women vs men). In this context, we show that the Kantorovich potentials of the images, which are a byproduct of computing the Wasserstein distance and act as "transportation prices", can serve as bias scores by indicating which images might exhibit distinct biased characteristics. We thus introduce a visual dataset exploration pipeline that helps auditors identify common characteristics across high- or low-scored images as potential sources of bias. We conduct a case study to identify prospective gender biases and demonstrate theoretically-derived properties with experiments on the CelebA and Biased MNIST datasets.

AB Network embedding can effectively dig out potentially useful information and discover the relationships and rules which exist in the data, that has attracted increasing attention in many real-world applications. The goal of network embedding is to map high-dimensional and sparse networks into low-dimensional and dense vector representations. In this paper, we propose a network embedding method based on high-degree penalty and adaptive negative sampling (NEPS). First, we analyze the problem of imbalanced node training in random walk and propose an indicator base on high-degree penalty, which can control the random walk and avoid over-sampling high-degree neighbor node. Then, we propose a two-stage adaptive negative sampling strategy, which can dynamically obtain negative samples suitable for the current training according to the training stage to improve training effect. By comparing with seven well-known network embedding algorithms on eight real-world data sets, experiments show that the NEPS has good performance in node classification, network reconstruction and link prediction.

AB Traffic density recognition is a computer vision task that involves detecting and estimating the density of vehicles in a given traffic scene. Traffic jam is a problem regularly faced by the public, mainly those living in crowded cities. For effective traffic management and signal control, it is necessary to know the road traffic density, particularly in overcrowded cities. Several methods were proposed for traffic density recognition, but the existing approaches inaccurately recognize the traffic density. Therefore, a Dual-discriminator Conditional giza pyramids construction Generative Adversarial Network based-Traffic Density Recognition (DCGAN-TDR) using road vehicle images is proposed for effective homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic density recognition. The input data is taken from the road vehicle images dataset, and its undesirable noises are removed with the help of anisotropic diffusion kuwahara filtering based preprocessing. For effective segmentation, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic bi-objective clustering method is used. Then the histogram of block multi-scale uniform local binary pattern is used for local feature representation, and for feature reduction two-directional two-dimension principal component analysis is used. The Dual-discriminator Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is used to classify the data as homogeneous and heterogeneous. Giza pyramids construction optimization is used to optimize the loss function of DCGAN to reduce the loss function and to enhance the accuracy. Then, the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, computational time and loss are evaluated to estimate the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of answering complex questions formulated by users in natural language. Since traditional information retrieval systems are not suitable for complex questions, these questions are usually run over knowledge bases, such as Wikidata or DBpedia. We propose a semi-automatic approach for transforming a natural language question into a SPARQL query that can be easily processed over a knowledge base. The approach applies classification techniques to associate a natural language question with a proper query template from a set of predefined templates. The nature of our approach is semi-automatic as the query templates are manually written by human assessors, who are the experts of the knowledge bases, whereas the classification and query processing steps are completely automatic. Our experiments on the large-scale CSQA dataset for question-answering corroborate the effectiveness of our approach.

DE Semantic similarity; Wikipedia; WordNet; Non-linear fitting
ID INFORMATION-CONTENT; REPRESENTATION
AB In recent years, researchers have proposed several feature-based methods to measure semantic similarity using knowledge resources like Wikipedia and WordNet. While Wikipedia covers millions of concepts with multiple features, it has some limitations such as articles with limited content and concept ambiguity. Disambiguating these concepts remains a challenge. Conversely, WordNet offers unambiguous terms by covering all possible senses, making it a useful resource for disambiguating Wikipedia concepts. Additionally, WordNet can enrich the limited content of Wikipedia articles. Thus, we present a new approach that combines both resources to enhance previous feature-based methods of semantic similarity. We begin by analyzing the limitations of previous research, followed by introducing a novel method to disambiguate Wikipedia concepts using WordNet's synonym structure, resulting in more effective disambiguation. Furthermore, we use WordNet to supplement the features in Wikipedia articles and redefine the feature similarity functions. Finally, we train non-linear fitting-based models to measure semantic similarity. Our approach outperforms other previous methods on various benchmarks. To further showcase our approach, we apply our models to develop a movie recommender system using the MovieLens dataset, which consistently outperforms other systems.

AB This paper proposes a meta heuristic optimization algorithm, called Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA), which simulates crayfish's summer resort behavior, competition behavior and foraging behavior. The three behaviors are divided into three different stages to balance the exploration and exploitation of algorithm. The three stages are summer resort stage, competition stage and foraging stage. The summer resort stage represents the exploration stage of the COA. The competition stage and foraging stage represent the exploitation stage of the COA. Exploration and exploitation of COA are regulated by temperature. When the temperature is too high, crayfish will enter the cave for summer vacation or compete for the same cave. When the temperature is appropriate, crayfish have different foraging behaviors according to the size of food. Among them, the amount of food eaten by crayfish is related to food intake. Through temperature regulate exploration and exploitation process in COA, the COA has higher randomness and global optimization effect. To verify the optimization effect of COA, in the experimental part, 23 standard benchmark functions and CEC2014 benchmark functions are used to test, and 9 algorithms are selected for comparative experiments. The experimental results show that COA can balance the exploration and exploitation, and achieve good optimization effect. Finally, the COA is tested in five engineering problems, and finally achieves better results. The source code website for COA is https://github.com/rao12138/COA-s-code.

AB This study presents an approach for predicting the slip ratio, a significant parameter in improving the autonomous navigation of robots. The novelty of the work is presented in two parts; first is the design of a Robot Operating System (ROS)-Physics Engine-based hybrid machine learning model with separate terrain classification and slip ratio estimation algorithms. The motivation for developing a hybrid model is presented by analyzing slip ratio-longitudinal friction coefficient characteristics in three different terrains: sand, grass, and asphalt. The longitudinal friction coefficient (mu x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mu _x$$\end{document}) values are distinct for the same values of slip ratio in different terrains, potentially influencing the model's feature extraction. The features for the slip estimation model are collected from torque sensors and IMU, which measure the external forces acting on robot wheels. The slip estimation is achieved using ensembles of weak classifiers to reduce the computational load of onboard systems. An optimized model with slip ratio classes as output has been evaluated and presented for three different terrains. The model provides an accuracy of 78.1% in the sand, 77.8% in the grass, and 73.5% in asphalt in simulations. The model is compared with a strong classifier used in previous works regarding the accuracy, training time, and computational time. Second, the virtually- trained learning algorithm is tested and validated using the physical robot whose virtual model is implemented in simulations with the actual slip ratio estimated using an experimental framework.

TI MSSPA-GC: Multi-Scale Shape Prior Adaptation with 3D Graph Convolutions
   for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation
SO NEURAL NETWORKS

DT Article
DE Object pose estimation; 3D object detection; Point cloud processing;
   Shape recovery; 3D graph convolution network
AB Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D object pose and size of arbitrary objects from known categories. It remains a challenge due to the large intra-class shape variation. Recently, the introduction of the shape prior adaptation mechanism into the normalized canonical coordinates (i.e., NOCS) reconstruction process has been shown to be effective in mitigating the intra-class shape variation. However, existing shape prior adaptation methods simply map the observed point cloud to the normalized object space, and the extracted object descriptors are not sufficient for the perception of the object pose. As a result, they fail to predict the pose of objects with complex geometric structures (e.g., cameras). To this end, this paper proposes a novel shape prior adaption method named MSSPA-GC for category-level object pose estimation. Specifically, our main network takes the observed instance point cloud converted from the RGB-D image and the prior shape point cloud pre-trained on the object CAD models as inputs. Then, a novel 3D graph convolution network and a PointNet-like MLP network are designed to extract pose-aware object features and shape-aware object features from these two inputs, respectively. After that, the two-stream object features are aggregated through a multi-scale feature propagation mechanism to generate comprehensive 3D object descriptors that maintain both pose-sensitive geometric stability and intra-class shape consistency. Finally, by leveraging object descriptors aware of both object pose and shape when reconstructing the NOCS coordinates, our approach elegantly achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely used REAL275 and CAMERA25 datasets using only 25% of the parameters compared with existing shape prior adaptation models. Moreover, our method also exhibits decent generalization ability on the unconstrained REDWOOD75 dataset.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We live in the age polarization, where conversations on matters of sustainability more often produce acrimony or stalemate than productive action. Better understanding conversation features and their impacts may lead to better innovation, solution-design, and ongoing collaboration. We describe a study to test alternate machine learning models for classifying six "discussion disciplines", which are conversation features associated with rhetorical intent. The model providing the best outcome used the Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) layered with a Residual Network (ResNet). The training data were 1135 utterances from Maine aquaculture town hall-like meetings and similar conversations, which had been hand-coded for the discussion disciplines. In addition, we generated 300 phrases corresponding to three conversation outcomes: Intent-to-Act, Options-Generation, and Relationship-Building. We then used the trained model and information retrieval to classify a large corpus of 591 open-source transcripts, containing over 21,000 utterances. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that two discussion disciplines, "Inclusion" and "Courtesy," had positive, statistically significant, impacts on Intent-to-act: a 10 percentage point increase in the share of the Inclusion or Courtesy yielded a 45% or 34% increase, respectively, in the likelihood of Intent-to-Act. This study shows the applicability of neural networks in modeling conversations and identifying the dialog acts that can provide measurable and predictable impact on conversation outcomes. Conversational intelligence can support a variety of human interactions, such as town halls, policy-deliberations, private-public partnerships, and sustainability teamwork.

AB Unsupervised cross-modal hashing has attracted considerable attention to support large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Although promising progresses have been made so far, existing methods still suffer from limited capability on excavating and preserving the intrinsic multi-modal semantics. In this paper, we propose a Correlation-Identity Reconstruction Hashing (CIRH) method to alleviate this challenging problem. We develop a new unsupervised deep cross-modal hash learning framework to model and preserve the heterogeneous multi-modal correlation semantics into both hash codes and functions, and simultaneously, we involve both the hash codes and functions with the descriptive identity semantics. Specifically, we construct a multi-modal collaborated graph to model the heterogeneous multi-modal correlations, and jointly perform the intra-modal and cross-modal semantic aggregation on homogeneous and heterogeneous graph networks to generate a multi-modal complementary representation with correlation reconstruction. Furthermore, an identity semantic reconstruction process is designed to involve the generated representation with identity semantics by reconstructing the input modality representations. Finally, we propose a correlation-identity consistent hash function learning strategy to transfer the modelled multi-modal semantics into the neural networks of modality-specific deep hash functions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on both retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

AB The sparseness and incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) trigger considerable interest in enhancing the representation learning with external corpora. However, the difficulty of aligning entities and relations with external corpora leads to inferior performance improvement. Open knowledge graphs (OKGs) consist of entity-mentions and relation-mentions that are represented by noncanonicalized freeform phrases, which generally do not rely on the specification of ontology schema. The roughness of the nonontological construction method leads to a specific characteristic of OKGs: diversity, where multiple entity-mentions (or relation-mentions) have the same meaning but different expressions. The diversity of OKGs can provide potential textual and structural features for the representation learning of KGs. We speculate that leveraging OKGs to enhance the representation learning of KGs can be more effective than using pure text or pure structure corpora. In this paper, we propose a new OERL, Open knowledge graph Enhanced Representation Learning of KGs. OERL automatically extracts textual and structural connections between KGs and OKGs, models and transfers refined profitable features to enhance the representation learning of KGs. The strong performance improvement and exhaustive experimental analysis prove the superiority of OERL over state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Online social networks have greatly facilitated our lives but have also propagated the spreading of rumours. Traditional works mostly find rumors from content, but content can be strategically manipulated to evade such detection, making these methods brittle. To improve the accuracy and robustness of rumor detection, we propose to integrate and exploit the content, propagation structure, and temporal relations because information in the networks always spreads dynamically with significant structures. In this paper, we propose a novel rumor detection framework in online temporal networks via structure learning. Specifically, to exploit the propagation structure, we propose a novel hyperedge walking strategy on a meta-hyperedge graph to learn the representations of sub-structures in the networks. Then a hyperedge expansion method is proposed to generate more global structural features. The expanded hyperedges are more hierarchical, making the learned structural embeddings more expressive. To make full use of content, we design a hypergraph learning model using hyperedge expansion to fuse node content with structural features and generate comprehensive representations for the entire graph. To exploit temporal relations, we design a masked temporal attention unit for learning the evolving patterns of the network. Extensive evaluations with six state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our solution.

AB In order to effectively handle multiple tasks that are not predefined, a robotic agent needs to automatically map its high-dimensional sensory inputs into useful features. As a solution, feature learning has empirically shown substantial improvements in obtaining representations that are generalizable to different tasks, compared to feature engineering approaches, but it requires a large amount of data and computational capacity. These challenges are specifically relevant in robotics due to the low signal-to-noise ratios inherent to robotic data, and to the cost typically associated with collecting this type of input. In this article, we propose a deep probabilistic method based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to learn visual features suitable for interaction and recognition tasks. We run our experiments on a self-supervised robotic sensorimotor data set. Our data were acquired with the iCub humanoid and are based on a standard object collection, thus being readily extensible. We evaluated the learned features in terms of usability for: 1) object recognition; 2) capturing the statistics of the effects; and 3) planning. In addition, where applicable, we compared the performance of the proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art models. These experiments demonstrate that our model is capable of capturing the functional statistics of action and perception (i.e., images) which performs better than existing baselines, without requiring millions of samples or any hand-engineered features.

AB Learning manipulation skills from observing human demonstration video is a promising aspect for intelligent robotic systems. Recent advances in Video-to-Command (V2C) provide an end-to-end approach to translate a video into robot plans. However, simultaneous V2C and action segmentation remain a major challenge for bimanual manipulations with fine-grained actions. Another concern is the generalization capability of end-to-end approaches in dealing with varied task parameters as well as environmental changes between the learned skills and the one-shot task demonstration for the robot to replay. In this article, we propose a two-stream network for robots to learn and segment manipulation subactions from human demonstration videos. Our framework with the self-attention mechanism can segment learned skills and generate action commands simultaneously. To arrive at refined plans in situations of underspecified or redundant human demonstrations, we utilize PDDL-based skill scripts to model the semantics of demonstrated activities and infer latent movements. Experimental results on the extended manipulation data set indicate that our approach generates more accurate commands than the state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiment results on a Baxter robotic arm also demonstrated the feasibility of our method in reproducing fine-grained actions from video demonstrations.

AB Prediction is a powerful approach to minimize errors and control problems in familiar environments and tasks. In human motor execution of sequential action, context effects can be observed, such as anticipation of or predictive movement toward target objects, where later subactions are affected by the execution of earlier subactions. In this article, we present a simulation framework for a serial reaching task using a 4-DoF robotic arm to examine the learning of context effects in simulated robotic reinforcement learning agents. As we demonstrate, giving robotic agents access to predictive information about a future target object's identity results in motion optimization, where the identity of the next target modulates earlier subactions. Specifically, agents learn to anticipate and predict the location of the next target object, and move toward it before it appears, thus achieving higher rewards than agents that were not given predictive information.

ID ROBOTS; INFORMATION
AB Human perception is based on unconscious inference, where sensory input integrates with prior information. This phenomenon, known as context dependency, helps in facing the uncertainty of the external world with predictions built upon previous experience. On the other hand, human perceptual processes are inherently shaped by social interactions. However, how the mechanisms of context dependency are affected is to date unknown. If using previous experience-priors-is beneficial in individual settings, it could represent a problem in social scenarios, where other agents might not have the same priors, causing a perceptual misalignment on the shared environment. The present study addresses this question. We studied context dependency in an interactive setting with a humanoid robot iCub that acted as a stimuli demonstrator. Participants reproduced the lengths shown by the robot in two conditions: one with iCub behaving socially and another with iCub acting as a mechanical arm. The different behavior of the robot significantly affected the use of prior in perception. Moreover, the social robot positively impacted perceptual performances by enhancing accuracy and reducing participants' overall perceptual errors. Finally, the observed phenomenon has been modeled following a Bayesian approach to deepen and explore a new concept of shared perception.

AB More predictable words are easier to process-they are read faster and elicit smaller neural signals associated with processing difficulty, most notably, the N400 component of the event-related brain potential. Thus, it has been argued that the prediction of upcoming words is a key component of language comprehension, and that studying the amplitude of the N400 is a valuable way to investigate the predictions we make. In this study, we investigate whether the linguistic predictions of computational language models (LMs) or humans better reflect the way in which natural language stimuli modulate the amplitude of the N400. One important difference in the linguistic predictions of humans versus computational LMs is that while LMs base their predictions exclusively on the preceding linguistic context, humans may rely on other factors. We find that the predictions of three top-of-the-line contemporary LMs-1) GPT-3; 2) RoBERTa; and 3) ALBERT-match the N400 more closely than human predictions. This suggests that the predictive processes underlying the N400 may be more sensitive to the statistics of language than previously thought.

AB There is a lack of research on the distraction effects of music stimuli with the multiple time scales of biological functions. It should be preferable to propose an effective strategy for evaluating the time-varying behavior (TVB) of psychological responses to music during exercise on autonomic nervous activity (ANA). From the RR interval time series of electrocardiograms recorded during cycling with low intensity, we estimated ANA-related indices: time- and frequency-domain indices estimated from the fluctuations of the RR interval. Then, we searched the temporal distribution of the stimulus-response module (SRM) that appeared in the TVB. The inspection of distraction effects was done for properly selected ANA. Then, related indices and the ratings of perceived exertion for evaluating appropriate participants are based on both the impression of favorability to music and the SRM occurrences. The results inferred that the multiple time scales strategy could be of help to assess the suitable approach to identify the distraction effects of music stimuli.

ID ATTENTION
AB Micro expression recognition (MER) is a very challenging area of research due to its intrinsic nature and fine-grained changes. In the literature, the problem of MER has been solved through handcrafted/descriptor-based techniques. However, in recent times, deep learning (DL)-based techniques have been adopted to gain higher performance for MER. Also, rich survey articles on MER are available by summarizing the data sets, experimental settings, conventional, and DL methods. In contrast, these studies lack the ability to convey the impact of network design paradigms and experimental setting strategies for DL-based MER. Therefore, this article aims to provide a deep insight into the DL-based MER frameworks with a perspective on promises in network model designing, experimental strategies, challenges, and research needs. Also, the detailed categorization of available MER frameworks is presented in various aspects of model design and technical characteristics. Moreover, an empirical analysis of the experimental and validation protocols adopted by MER methods is presented. The challenges mentioned earlier and network design strategies may assist the affective computing research community in forge ahead in MER research. Finally, we point out the future directions, research needs, and draw our conclusions.

AB Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two distinct sources of learning in children but education sciences demonstrate that mixed approaches such as assisted discovery or guided play result in improved skill acquisition. In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), these extremes, respectively, map to autonomous agents learning from their own signals and interactive learning agents fully taught by their teachers. In between should stand teachable autonomous agents (TAA): agents that learn from both internal and teaching signals to benefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Designing such agents will enable real-world nonexpert users to orient the learning trajectories of agents toward their expectations. More fundamentally, this may also be a key step to build agents with human-level intelligence. This article presents a roadmap toward the design of teachable autonomous agents from a developmental AI perspective. Building on developmental psychology and education sciences, we start by identifying key features enabling assisted discovery processes in child-tutor interactions. This leads to the production of a checklist of features that future TAAs will need to demonstrate. The checklist allows us to precisely pinpoint the various limitations of current reinforcement learning agents and to identify the promising first steps toward TAAs. It also shows the way forward by highlighting key research directions toward the design or autonomous agents that can be taught by ordinary people via natural pedagogy.

AB As a popular concept proposed in the field of psychology, affordance has been regarded as one of the important abilities that enable humans to understand and interact with the environment. Briefly, it captures the possibilities and effects of the actions of an agent applied to a specific object or, more generally, a part of the environment. This article provides a short review of the recent developments of deep robotic affordance learning (DRAL), which aims to develop data-driven methods that use the concept of affordance to aid in robotic tasks. We first classify these papers from a reinforcement learning (RL) perspective and draw connections between RL and affordances. The technical details of each category are discussed and their limitations are identified. We further summarize them and identify future challenges from the aspects of observations, actions, affordance representation, data-collection, and real-world deployment. A final remark is given at the end to propose a promising future direction of the RL-based affordance definition to include the predictions of arbitrary action consequences.

AB The existing models for vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and optokinetic response (OKR) learning utilize neural circuit structure and capture a few characteristics of these two learning systems. However, it remains unclear how the error signals guide these learning processes. Here, we propose novel dynamic learning models using error feedback in a flexible fashion to account for both VOR and OKR learning. We first used a feedback modulation model (FMM) and found the error signals play an essential guiding role in the gain compensation of wild-type mice. However, this FMM cannot accurately reproduce gain changes during the recovery period. Therefore, we propose a nonuniform FMM using flexible plasticity learning rules of different memory sites to take into account the effect of classical linearity models in both training and recovery periods. To further study learning characteristics of gain reduction, we introduce a reversal-phase FMM and explore the contribution of synaptic plasticity to adaptive learning, in which characteristics and bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the VOR-decrease learning mode can be fully recovered. Taken together, our results suggest that, to explain VOR and OKR learning systems, one needs dynamical models with flexible and multiple components at different or same sites of neuronal circuits.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, the most common form of dementia, affecting millions worldwide. Neuroimaging-based early AD diagnosis has become an effective approach, especially by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method is challenging to learn dependencies between spatially distant positions in the various brain regions due to its local convolution operation. In contrast, the graph convolutional network (GCN)-based work can connect the brain regions to capture global information but is not sensitive to the local information in a single brain region. Unlike a separate CNN or GCN-based method, we proposed a brain-inspired global-local information fusion network (BGL-Net) to diagnose AD. It essentially inherits the advantages of both CNN and GCN. The experiments on three public data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our BGL-Net. Our method achieved the best performance on three popular public data sets compared with the existing CNN and GCN-based methods. In addition, our visualization results of the learned brain connection on AD and normal people agree with many current AD clinical research.

AB From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.

TI Query Path Generation via Bidirectional Reasoning for Multihop Question
   Answering From Knowledge Bases
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Knowledge base; multihop reasoning; question answering; text mining
AB Multihop question answering from knowledge bases (KBQA) is a hot research topic in natural language processing. Recently, the graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods have achieved promising results as the KB can be organized as a knowledge graph (KG). However, they often suffered from the sparsity of the KG which was detrimental to the structure encoding and reasoning capabilities of GNN. Specifically, a KG is a sparse graph linked by directed relations and previous studies have paid scant attention to the directional characteristic of relations in the KG, limiting the patterns of relation path that GNN-based approaches could resolve. This study proposes a bidirectional recurrent GNN (BRGNN) to tackle these difficulties. To model the bidirectional information of relations, all adjacent relations of an entity are grouped by their directions, and they are separately aggregated into the entity representation in outward and inward directions. For the reasoning process, BRGNN simultaneously considers the neighbor relations in both directions to cover more patterns of relation paths and improve the recall of answers. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks: WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, and MetaQA, verify that BRGNN can answer more questions by taking into account the directional information, and it is competitive to all state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Emotional learning is a very important learning mechanism for the human body, and it is also an important part of artificial intelligence. This article proposes a bionic circuit, which simulates the dual loop of emotional learning in the human brain. The circuit uses the characteristics of the memristor to simulate the fast loop that quickly generates initial emotions to predict danger and the detour loop which generates a more refined emotion by further processing of the input information. The circuit includes: 1) thalamus module; 2) sensory cortex module; and 3) amygdala module. The first module sends the strongest input stimulus directly to the amygdala module for rapid processing. The second module processes the input stimuli and sends them to the amygdala module for emotion generation and judgment. The third module is responsible for generating output signals representing the corresponding emotions. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the output signal generated by the circuit can represent the characteristics of the dual loop of emotional learning, and more realistically simulate the biological process. By configuring the parameters, this circuit can be more flexibly applied to the radiation intensity early warning system to protect the safety of humans when working in a radiation environment.

AB It is an important issue that how to regulate the existing control models of musculoskeletal robots to improve the ability of motion learning and generalization. In this article, based on the motion modulation function of the cerebellum, a cerebellum-inspired prediction and correction model is proposed to carry out feedforward regulation of the original controller. First, drawing on the reservoir computing mechanism of the cerebellar granular layer, the cerebellum prediction model is established by using the echo state network. Incremental learning for the network is achieved using the replay method, which is able to process control signals with different distributions. The cerebellum prediction network can accurately predict the motion results of the robot under the action of the time-series control signals. Second, referring to the neural pathways of the cerebellum, the cerebellum correction model is constructed. The network learning rules are designed by drawing on the long-term potentiation and depression processes of cerebellar synaptic plasticity. The characteristics of the parameters in the network weight update equations are further analyzed. And the hyperparameter update rules of the correction network weights are proposed. To simulate the function of the cerebellum involved in the limb ballistic movement, the adaptive adjustment method for cerebellum correction duration is proposed. The cerebellum correction network can accurately modulate the original control signals by using the motion prediction results. In experiments, a musculoskeletal robot is used to verify the movement effects under the control of the cerebellum model. The results show that the cerebellum-inspired model can effectively improve the motion accuracy and learning efficiency of the musculoskeletal robot, and enhance the motion generalization ability and system robustness of the robot.

TI Learning Human-to-Robot Dexterous Handovers for Anthropomorphic Hand
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS

DE Anthropomorphic hand; handovers; human-robot interaction
ID MOVEMENT PRIMITIVES; GRASP
AB Human-robot interaction plays an important role in robots serving human production and life. Object handover between humans and robotics is one of the fundamental problems of human-robot interaction. The majority of current work uses parallel-jaw grippers as the end-effector device, which limits the ability of the robot to grab miscellaneous objects from human and manipulate them subsequently. In this article, we present a framework for human-to-robot dexterous handover using an anthropomorphic hand. The framework takes images captured by two cameras to complete handover scene understanding, grasp configurations prediction, and handover execution. To enable the robot to generalize to diverse delivered objects with miscellaneous shapes and sizes, we propose an anthropomorphic hand grasp network (AHG-Net), an end-to-end network that takes the single-view point clouds of the object as input and predicts the suitable anthropomorphic hand configurations with five different grasp taxonomies. To train our model, we build a large-scale data set with 1M hand grasp annotations from 5K single-view point clouds of 200 objects. We implement a handover system using a UR5 robot arm and HIT-DLR II anthropomorphic robot hand based on our presented framework, which can not only adapt to different human givers but generalize to diverse novel objects with various shapes and sizes. The generalizability, reliability, and robustness of our method are demonstrated on 15 different novel objects with arbitrary handover poses from frontal and lateral positions, a system ablation study, a grasp planner comparison, and a user study on 6 participants delivering 15 objects from two benchmark sets.

TI Deep Decoupling Classification and Regression for Visual Tracking
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Attention mechanism; Siamese network; transformer; visual tracking
AB Classification and regression are two tasks that most Siamese-based trackers need to handle. However, most of the existing trackers only learn one feature embedding to handle these two types of task, making it difficult to optimize both simultaneously. To solve this problem, this article tries to deeply decouple classification and regression in the model structure. Specifically, two feature extraction backbone networks are used to divide the model into two branches to extract the heterogeneous features suitable for the two tasks, respectively. Inspired by the core idea of transformer, information interaction and fusion between multiple branches are achieved by the cross-attention mechanism, which can fully exploit the deep information dependence between multiple branches. In addition, the concept of channel-level information interaction is proposed by innovatively changing the generation mode of vector groups in the attention module. The experiments show that double Siamese tracker (DST) designed in this article greatly improves the accuracy of classification and regression. DST runs at 60 frames per second (FPS) on GPU, far above the real-time requirement.

AB Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a vital role in affective cognition. However, there will be some limitations when facing the FER with single facial image data. Considering that extra data contains more information for molding, the facial action unit (AU) can be adopted as privileged information (PI) to assist the FER task. This article integrates AU information into an end-to-end deep network to support FER training. The proposed privileged action unit network (PAU-Net) gives ways of integrating AU information from the input aspect (type I) and output aspect (type II). Type I of PAU-Net takes AUs as input to guide the facial image network learning, which provides the AU-based emotion recognition result for the image-based FER model. While, type II of PAU-Net utilizes AUs as the output label for shallow layers of the network, which helps the model learn AU-related features and further assists advanced facial expression feature learning in subsequent layers. Note that PI enhances the network during the training and will not occur during the testing. Therefore, the network can still perform robustly with original input data in practice. Experiments are based on the CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PAU-Net in FER tasks.

AB Visual place recognition has gained popularity in recent years. Mainstream convolutional neural network-based methods formulate it as a ranking task and optimize it in the paradigm of deep metric learning, however, the ranking-motivated losses concern only the ranking relationship for each query image and the compactness of intraplace feature distribution is seldom considered. It is still challenging due to varying viewpoints, illuminations, and even dynamic objects. In this article, a novel multitask learning framework is proposed, which combines the existing triplet ranking task and our designed binary classification task to jointly optimize the network for better generalization capability. Specifically, a binary classification network with the corresponding binary cross-entropy loss is designed in the classification task. In this way, the intraplace feature compactness and interplace feature separability are reinforced. At the testing stage, this classification network is discarded without increasing the computation cost. Furthermore, an attention module is presented to promote the network to concentrate on the salient regions by assigning different importance to each spatial position. Our method achieves the top-10 recalls of 97.27%, 94.6%, and 96.93% on Pitts250k-test, Tokyo 24/7, and TokyoTM-val data sets, respectively. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed network can learn discriminative global features with better robustness to viewpoints and environmental variations.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a widespread global mental disease. The effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants prescribed for MDD patients is limited and pretreatment assessment of treatment outcome is a vital task. In this study, a hybrid model based on transfer learning (TL) of powerful pretrained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) empowered with bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) cells and attention mechanism were developed to classify responders (R) and nonresponders (NR) to SSRI antidepressants, using raw data images of pretreatment electro-encephalogram (EEG) signal obtained from 30 MDD patients. TL-LSTM-Attention models based on VGG16, Xception, and Densenet121 models were created for the classification of R/NR. Results show that the highest performance of hybrid TL-LSTM-Attention models was achieved by VGG16-LSTM-Attention with an accuracy of 98.21%, sensitivity of 96.22%, and specificity of 99.67%. An ensemble model based on weighted majority voting among hybrid models is constructed to surpass the performance of each single hybrid model. Our proposed ensemble model gained accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.84%, 97.80%, and 99.60%, respectively. Hence, the proposed model which is an ensemble of TL-LSTM-Attention models fed by raw data images of EEG signal leads to high confidence in the prediction of antidepressants treatment outcome.

AB Hippocampus, a special neuroanatomical structures, has been a realistic research model for the storage and retrieval of short-term and long-term memory. This article proposes a mathematic hippocampus model and bionic memory circuit which not only emulates the memory generation but also realizes the transformation from low to high-level memory. Based on the interior connections of the hippocampus, the proposed circuit reconstructs an episodic memory processing model and achieves the functions of multilevel memory generation. Memristor plays a vital role in imitating the plasticity of synapses in hippocampus recurrence, and its characteristics of switching dynamics are applied for controlling multilevel memory generation. Leveraging the proposed circuit, we propose a multilevel memorial generation system which has the capacities of perception quantification, memorial generation, and comprised the following: 1) receiver module; 2) quantitative module; 3) three-layer hippocampus memory circuit; and 4) memory generation module. The simulation results in PSpice indicate that the application of the model can quantize the episodic memory, afterward processing it by a three-layer hippocampus memory circuit to generate the multilevel memory. Moreover, this work paves the way for the memorial architecture in robotics by emulating the hippocampus memory principle.

AB The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an illusory experience in which a fake rubber hand is felt as if it were one's own hand when the visible fake and invisible real hands are stimulated synchronously. Although several studies have suggested contributions of action to body ownership using the RHI paradigm, the relationship between body ownership and agency has not yet been fully revealed. To better understand this relationship, the present study investigated the transfer of body ownership between body parts induced by a body part action. Using an RHI paradigm involving virtual reality, we tested whether a simple finger action of the dominant (active) hand can induce the embodiment of a virtual hand corresponding to the nondominant (inactive) hand. We evaluated the illusory experience, perceptual changes, and physiological changes during the experiment with a subjective questionnaire, crossmodal congruency effect measurement, and skin temperature measurement, respectively. The results demonstrated that the finger action induced the embodiment of both virtual hands, causing a significant increase in agency of the inactive hand. This suggests that the illusory experience induced by an active body part contributes to an increase in agency as well as body ownership over the virtual body of the other inactive body part.

AB Arranging objects from a random and scattered distribution into an integral part has many applications, including bin packing, logistics, and other industrial fields. Measurement noises, manipulation uncertainties, models of irregular objects, and rich contacts bring considerable challenges to the improvements of the overall performance, such as seamlessness of the final pattern and task efficiency. In this article, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy that generates a series of pushing movements for scattered irregular objects inside a crate. An abstracted and sparse reward function is proposed to evaluate the pushing performance, and the proximal policy optimization (PPO) learning method that simultaneously trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a fully connected actor network is developed for end-to-end decision making. The proposed method is evaluated in both simulation and real-world scenarios. The results show that the proposed method can arrange the scattered objects tightly to fit into each other in an efficient and flexible way, and can be transferred to the real world with unseen objects.

AB Estimating gaze from a low-resolution (LR) facial image is a challenging task. Most current networks for gaze estimation focus on using face images of adequate resolution. Their performance degrades when the image resolution decreases due to information loss. This work aims to explore more helpful face and gaze information in a novel way to alleviate the problem of information loss in the LR gaze estimation task. Considering that all faces have a relatively fixed structure, it is feasible to reconstruct the residual information of face and gaze based on the solid constraint of the prior knowledge of face structure through learning an end-to-end mapping from pairs of low- and high-resolution (HR) images. This article proposes a complementary dual-branch network (CDBN) to achieve this task. A fundamental branch is designed to extract features of the major structural information from LR input. A residual branch is employed to reconstruct features containing the residual information as a supplement under the supervision of both the HR image and gaze direction. These two features are then fused and processed for gaze estimation. Experimental results on three widely used data sets, MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, and RT-GENE, show that the proposed CDBN achieves more accurate gaze estimation from the LR input image compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Word and phone discovery are important tasks in the language development of human infants. Infants acquire words and phones from unsegmented speech signals using segmentation cues, such as distributional, prosodic, and co-occurrence information. Many pre-existing computational models designed to represent this process tend to focus on distributional or prosodic cues. In this study, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic generative model called the prosodic hierarchical Dirichlet process-hidden language model (prosodic HDP-HLM) designed to perform simultaneous phone and word discovery from continuous speech signals encoded as time-series data that may exhibit a double articulation structure. Prosodic HDP-HLM, as an extension of HDP-HLM, considers both prosodic and distributional cues within a single integrative generative model. We further propose a prosodic double articulation analyzer (Prosodic DAA) based on an inference procedure derived for prosodic HDP-HLM. We conducted three experiments on different types of data sets, including, Japanese vowel sequence, utterances for teaching object names and features, and utterances following Zipf's law, and the results demonstrated the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the Prosodic DAA successfully used prosodic cues and was able to discover words directly from continuous human speech using distributional and prosodic information in an unsupervised manner, outperforming a method that solely used distributional cues. In contrast, the phone discovery performance did not improve. We also show that prosodic cues contributed to word discovery performance more when the word frequency was distributed more naturally, i.e., following Zipf's law.

AB A motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising system that can help neuromuscular injury patients recover or replace their motor abilities. Currently, before one uses MI-BCI, we need to collect a large amount of training data to train the decoding model, and this process is time consuming. When trained with a small amount of data, existing decoding methods generally do not perform well in MI decoding tasks. Therefore, it is important to improve the decoding performance with short calibration data. In this study, we propose a dynamic weighted filter bank domain adaptation framework that uses data from an existing subject to reduce the requirement of data from the new subject. A filter bank is used to explore information from different frequency subbands. A feature extractor with two 1-D convolutional layers is designed to extract electroencephalography features. The class-specific Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN)-based domain adaptation network aligns the distribution of each class between the data from the new subject and the data from the existing subject. Additionally, we apply an attention network to dynamically allocate different weights for different frequency bands. We evaluate our method on a public MI data set and a self-collected data set. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best decoding accuracy among the compared methods with different amounts of training data. On the public data set, our method achieves 8.88% and 7.16% higher decoding accuracy than the best comparing method with one block of training data on the two sessions, respectively. This indicates that our method can enhance MI decoding accuracy with a small amount of training data.

ID EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; LONG
AB In recent years, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been common in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure prediction. However, CNNs lose local and global connections and spatial information due to local connections and pooling operations. In addition, existing seizure prediction methods often require the design of special feature pre-extraction steps. Therefore, an end-to-end patient-specific seizure predictor based on the feedback capsule network (FB-CapsNet) is proposed in this study. It can characterize complex temporal information and precise spatial relationships, capture and integrate spatiotemporal properties directly from the raw EEG signal, and distinguish seizure states. The proposed FB-CapsNet first uses a feedback network to extract temporal information and 1-D convolution to reduce the data dimensionality. Then, it uses the capsule network to capture spatial information and other instantiation properties and store them in capsule vectors. Finally, it performs information flow between low-level and high-level capsules by a dynamic routing mechanism to obtain superior classification performance. The proposed FB-CapsNet achieves 95.7% sensitivity, 0.087/h false positive rate (FPR), and 0.948 area under curve (AUC) on the CHB-MIT scalp data set and 88.6% sensitivity, 0.127/h FPR, and 0.837 AUC on Kaggle data set.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB With the increasing complexity of the air combat environment, the optimal flights path is no longer the only requirement for the path planning system of an unmanned autonomous helicopter (UAH). To enable the UAH path planning system to efficiently handle path planning problems in complex environments, a path planning method is proposed based on satisficing decision-enhanced hybrid swarm intelligence in this article. First, the UAH path planning is modeled as the multiobjective optimization problem. Besides the traditional flight cost of path planning, the performance of UAH and the safety constraints are both considered in this article to establish the fitness function of path planning. Then, a hybrid satisficing decision-enhanced swarm intelligence (HSD-SI) path planning algorithm is proposed based on the satisficing decision method. Through the collaboration and feedback between the hybrid algorithms, the satisfaction enhancement factor is dynamically adjusted so that the HSD-SI algorithm has multiple optimization properties. Thus, the UAH path planning system based on the HSD-SI algorithm can intelligently plan satisfactory flight paths according to the requirements of the mission. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the HSD-SI algorithm in dealing with the UAH path planning problems.

ID BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION
AB In this study, a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) system combining P300 potential and emotion patterns was proposed to improve the performance of awareness detection. Two video clips were flashed randomly to evoke the P300 potential, while a laughing or crying video clip was used to induce the corresponding emotion pattern. The subjects were asked to concentrate on the laughing or crying video clip cued by the instruction and to count the flashes of the corresponding video clip. Two layers of classification were developed. In the first layer, P300 detection and emotion recognition were performed separately using two support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Specifically, the activation, spatial, and connection patterns were fused in emotion recognition. In the second layer, the SVM scores of P300 detection and emotion recognition were fed into another SVM classifier to determine which video clip the subjects responded to. Six healthy subjects and eight patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) were involved in the command-following experiment. The results showed that the accuracy of the hybrid BCI system was better than those of the single-modality systems. Furthermore, three patients were able to perform tasks (66%-72%) using our hybrid BCI, which indicated their residual awareness and emotion-related abilities.

ID INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; EXPLORATION; SYSTEMS
AB Autotelic reinforcement learning (RL) agents sample their own goals, and try to reach them. They often prioritize goal sampling according to some intrinsic reward, ex. novelty or absolute learning progress (ALPs). Novelty-based approaches work robustly in unsupervised image-based environments when there are no distractors. However, they construct simple curricula that do not take the agent's performance into account: in complex environments, they often get attracted by impossible tasks. ALP-based approaches, which are often combined with a clustering mechanism, construct complex curricula tuned to the agent's current capabilities. Such curricula sample goals on which the agent is currently learning the most, and do not get attracted by impossible tasks. However, ALP approaches have not so far been applied to DRL agents perceiving complex environments directly in the image space. Goal regions guided intrinsically motivated goal exploration process (GRIMGEP), without using any expert knowledge, combines the ALP clustering approaches with novelty-based approaches and extends them to those complex scenarios. We experiment on a rich 3-D image-based environment with distractors using novelty-based exploration approaches: Skewfit and CountBased. We show that wrapping them with GRIMGEP-using them only in the cluster sampled by ALP-creates a better curriculum. The wrapped approaches are attracted less by the distractors, and achieve drastically better performances.

AB In motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), common spatial pattern (CSP) is most popularly used for discriminant feature extraction. However, the performance of CSP depends on the operational frequency bands, which are selected manually or set to a broad frequency range in most of the previously developed applications. Due to subject to subject or even trial to trial variability of frequency band affected by MI task, these methods suffer from the poor performance. We have proposed a novel approach, using combination of multivariate iterative filtering (MIF) and CSP (MIFCSP), to automatically select optimal frequency bands based on MIF which can be further used for discriminant feature extraction. MIF decomposes the signal into several multivariate intrinsic mode functions, from which features are extracted using CSP. We select the minimum number of most significant features for which highest classification accuracy is achieved. Subsequently, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to classify different MI tasks. Experimental results for BCI competition IV data set 2a and BCI competition III-IIIa are presented. For left-hand versus right-hand MI classification, proposed MIFCSP method provides 83.18% and 84.44% average accuracy, respectively. Superior classification performance confirms that MIFCSP is a promising candidate for MI BCI application.

ID RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Cognitive deficits occur in up to 90% of patients with brain metastases and can be caused by the tumor itself and whole brain radiation therapy. Latest treatment options to reduce cognitive decline require high-precision metastases segmentation. This asks existing metastases segmentation models to be further improved as their limited ability to micro lesion perception. To reduce the segmentation error on brain tissues and improve the accuracy on micro metastases, a deep slice-crossed network (SCNet) and a local weighted loss are proposed, respectively. The SCNet contains a gated feature fusion module where the "gate" is learned individually from the slice-crossed label to roughly localize metastases. Then, in tumor regions, this gate allows intraslice information to pass for metastases enhancement, while in other regions, it allows interslice information to pass for vascular screening. The local weighted loss is proposed to address the inconsistency in size of intraclass objects. Unlike existing weighting approaches, it calculates the weight of each pixel from its neighborhood pixel distribution to enhance the learning of pixels within small tumors, which can be applied to common losses. To evaluate them, two data sets containing 1000 and 368 patients, respectively, were collated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method perform satisfactorily compared with state-of-the-art brain metastasis segmentation models.

AB Research in human gait analysis has captivated several computer vision researchers to solve human identification problems. The proposed work provides a novel approach for cognitive state estimation via multimodal analysis. The advantage of the multimodal system is to provide adequate motion signatures with the ensemble of multimodal gait data to ensure data reliability for classification. The relationship between human cognitive states and gait is predicted using both temporal and nontemporal probabilistic models. We estimate prior probability tables for the nontemporal probabilistic model known as a simple Bayesian model after analyzing the data acquired from the inertial measurement unit (IMU), electroencephalography (EEG), and multiple Kinect V2.0 sensors. A novel dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used as a probabilistic temporal model for estimating the most probable sequence of transitions among human cognitive states. We apply Gaussian mixture modeling with expectation maximization (GMM-EM) to tune transition and emission probabilities for maximizing the probability of the observed sequence. A promising estimation accuracy of 88.6% is obtained. Also, principal component analysis (PCA) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms are applied separately to calculate the input probabilities for DBN model. It is observed that both GMM-EM and kNN-based approaches outperform all the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, standard statistical tests are performed on the acquired data set to validate the experimental results.

AB There are many constraints for a multirobot system to perform a region coverage search task in an unknown environment. To address this, we propose a novel multirobot distributed collaborative region coverage search algorithm based on Glasius bio-inspired neural network (GBNN). First, we develop an environmental information updating model to represent the dynamic search environment. This model converts the environmental information detected by the robot into dynamic neural activity landscape of GBNN. Second, we introduce the distributed model predictive control method in search path planning to improve search efficiency. In addition, we propose a distributed collaborative decision-making mechanism among the robots to produce several dynamic search subteams. Within each subteam, collaborative decisions are made among the robot members to optimize the solution and obtain the next movement path of each robot. Finally, we conduct experiments in three aspects to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with three algorithms in this field, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits good performance in a multirobot region coverage search task.

AB The difference between training and testing environments is a huge challenge to generalizing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We propose a soft contrastive learning with a coarser approximate Q-irrelevance abstraction for RL (SCQRL) to increase RL generalization. Specifically, we specify the coarser approximate Q-irrelevance abstraction as the feature of the state with a theoretical analysis for better generalization ability. We construct a positive and negative sample selection mechanism based on the Q value for contrastive learning to achieve efficient representation learning. Considering the selection error of positive and negative samples, we design soft contrastive learning and combine it with RL in the form of an auxiliary task to propose SCQRL. The generalization experiments on several Procgen environments demonstrate that SCQRL outperforms the excellent generalized RL algorithm.

ID EVOLUTION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Studies have shown evolution strategies (ES) to be a promising approach for reinforcement learning (RL) with deep neural networks. However, the issue of high sample complexity persists in applications of ES to deep RL over long horizons. This article is the first to address the shortcoming of today's methods via a novel neuroevolutionary multitasking (NuEMT) algorithm, designed to transfer information from a set of auxiliary tasks (of short episode length) to the target (full length) RL task at hand. The auxiliary tasks, extracted from the target, allow an agent to update and quickly evaluate policies on shorter time horizons. The evolved skills are then transferred to guide the longer and harder task toward an optimal policy. We demonstrate that the NuEMT algorithm achieves data-efficient evolutionary RL, reducing expensive agent-environment interaction data requirements. Our key algorithmic contribution in this setting is to introduce a first multitask skills transfer mechanism based on the statistical importance sampling technique. In addition, an adaptive resource allocation strategy is utilized to assign computational resources to auxiliary tasks based on their gleaned usefulness. Experiments on a range of continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym confirm that our proposed algorithm is efficient compared to recent ES baselines.

AB Despite sometimes noisy evidence (e.g., perceptual processing errors), young children are capable of predicting and evaluating events based on complex causal representations. Children rapidly revise their beliefs and learn scientific concepts-sometimes without prior knowledge of an underlying causal system. What might we need in our computational models of belief revision to similarly simulate children's behaviors when learning such causal systems? Building from experimental data of elementary school children's intuitive beliefs and predictions of water displacement, we propose three aspects of human inference and belief revision that warrant attention within the subfield of computational cognition. Each aspect is described by identifying the gaps between empirical findings and current computational implementations. Then, specific implementations of these aspects are built using models of theory-based Bayesian inference. First, we construct children's prior beliefs at the individual level based on their prior behavior. Second, we approximate children's learning using an "optimal" Bayesian model, revealing the dynamics of belief revision trial-by-trial. Third, we investigate that the role prediction may have in facilitating learning. By performing these key computational steps, we find support for contemporary claims that children may be approximately "Bayesian" learners and increase awareness of the importance of generating predictions in active learning.

AB Environmental sound recognition (ESR) is an emerging research topic in audio pattern recognition. Many tasks are presented to resort to computational models for ESR in real-life applications. However, current models are usually designed for individual tasks, and are not robust and applicable to other tasks. Cross-task models, which promote unified knowledge modeling across various tasks, have not been thoroughly investigated. In this article, we propose a cross-task model for three different tasks of ESR: 1) acoustic scene classification; 2) urban sound tagging; and 3) anomalous sound detection. An architecture named SE-Trans is presented that uses attention mechanism-based Squeeze-and-Excitation and Transformer encoder modules to learn the channelwise relationship and temporal dependencies of the acoustic features. FMix is employed as the data augmentation method that improves the performance of ESR. Evaluations for the three tasks are conducted on the recent databases of detection and classification of acoustic scenes and event challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed cross-task model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all tasks. Further analysis demonstrates that the proposed cross-task model can effectively utilize acoustic knowledge across different ESR tasks.

DE Correlation among labels; multihead attention; multilabel
   classification; multiturn dialogue
AB XMultiturn dialogue systems with cognitive capabilities have been popularly used in many applications and generate a large volume of dialogue texts. The dialogue texts of many dialogue systems contain multiple labels, and a typical case is that the customer requirements or complaints in an online multiturn dialogue service system often need to be classified into multiple categories or forwarded to multiple departments, that is, multilabel classification on multiturn dialogue texts. Traditional methods treat the dialogue text as the plain text, which makes it difficult for classifiers to learn important features. On the other hand, regarding each utterance as the basic semantic unit may destroy the semantic information integrity of the dialogue. Furthermore, the above methods all ignore the relationship between labels. To address above issues, we propose to use the utterance pair as the basic semantic unit and design a novel multilabel classification model for multiturn dialogue texts in this article. Specifically, we propose to use the multihead attention mechanism to learn the key features of multiple labels and design a new method to learn the correlation among labels. Besides, we propose to use the penalty term to allow multihead attention to focus on different semantics. Finally, we conduct sufficient experiments on four real-world multiturn dialogue data sets and the experimental results show that our model produces superior performance.

AB In recent years, significant progress has been made in semantic segmentation methods. Traditional semantic segmentation methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) are prone to lose spatial information in the feature extraction stage, and pay less attention to global context information, especially, in some lightweight real-time semantic segmentation networks. This is a huge challenge for semantic segmentation tasks. In addition, although some methods have improved this problem to a certain extent, they are often embedded in specific networks and cannot be applied to other network models. Aiming at these problems, a semantic segmentation method based on multilayer feature fusion is proposed. The flexible and lightweight squeeze-excitation module is used to improve the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network, and the accuracy of the semantic segmentation method is further improved by extracting network feature information at different levels. To verify the efficiency and commonality of our methodology, we selected ERFNet and Deeplabv3 networks to experiment on Cityscapes and COCO data sets. Experiments show that our best method can improve 3.1% mIoU and 3.2% mAcc on the Cityscapes data set relative to ERFNet, and at the same time, our method can achieve 61.93 FPS on 1024 x 512 resolution images and the best improvement of 0.9% mIoU 1.4% mAcc was achieved on the Deeplabv3 network. The experimental results show that the improved multilayer feature fusion structure can improve the accuracy of the semantic segmentation network.

AB According to Hebbian theory, synaptic plasticity is the ability of neurons to strengthen or weaken the synapses among them in response to stimuli. It plays a fundamental role in the processes of learning and memory of biological neural networks. With plasticity, biological agents can adapt on multiple timescales and outclass artificial agents, the majority of which still rely on static artificial neural network (ANN) controllers. In this work, we focus on voxel-based soft robots ( VSRs), a class of simulated artificial agents, composed as aggregations of elastic cubic blocks. We propose a Hebbian ANN controller where every synapse is associated with a Hebbian rule that controls the way the weight is adapted during the VSR lifetime. For a given task and morphology, we optimize the controller for the task of locomotion by evolving, rather than the weights, the parameters of Hebbian rules. Our results show that the Hebbian controller is comparable, often better than a non-Hebbian baseline and that it is more adaptable to damages. We also provide novel insights into the inner workings of plasticity and demonstrate that "true" learning does take place, as the evolved controllers improve over the lifetime and generalize well.

AB The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals record electrical activities generated by the brain cells and are used as a state-of-the-art diagnosis tool for various neural disorders. However, the unwanted artifacts often contaminate the recorded EEG signals and disturb the interpretation of the neuronal activity. This article aims to propose an efficient automatic method to eliminate the ocular artifacts (OAs) from the multichannel EEG signals with novel frequency-spatial filtering. The method combines dictionary-based spatial filtering and frequency-based signal decomposition method, namely, empirical wavelet transform (EWT). The artifact dictionary needed for spatial filtering is isolated from the raw data by: 1) selecting the contaminated channels and 2) frequency-domain filtering. More precisely, the delta-rhythms of identified highly contaminated channels are selected and placed into an artifact dictionary. Afterward, the delta-rhythms of multichannel EEG signals are spatially filtered using the built dictionary to seclude the OAs within a limited number of components. Furthermore, the artifact components are eliminated and clean delta-rhythms are recovered using the inverse spatial filtering technique. Finally, the clean delta-rhythms are combined with other EEG rhythms to reconstruct the OA-free signals. The proposed method is applied to OA-contaminated synthetic and real multichannel EEG signals with a convincing performance as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method removes the OAs without affecting the background EEG information. The proposed method can ease sensor signal interpretation and further processing, e.g., for BCI applications.

DE Joint search; model compression; pruning; reinforcement learning
ID ATTENTION
AB Currently, an increasing number of model pruning methods are proposed to resolve the contradictions between the computer powers required by the deep learning models and the resource-constrained devices. However, for simple tasks like robotic detection, most of the traditional rule-based network pruning methods cannot reach a sufficient compression ratio with low accuracy loss and are time consuming as well as laborious. In this article, we propose automatic blockwise and channel-wise network pruning (ABCP) to jointly search the blockwise and channelwise pruning action for robotic detection by deep reinforcement learning. A joint sample algorithm is proposed to simultaneously generate the pruning choice of each residual block and the channel pruning ratio of each convolutional layer from the discrete and continuous search space, respectively. The best pruning action taking both the accuracy and the complexity of the model into account is obtained finally. Compared with the traditional rule-based pruning method, this pipeline saves human labor and achieves a higher compression ratio with lower accuracy loss. Tested on the mobile robot detection data set, the pruned YOLOv3 model saves 99.5% floating-point operations, reduces 99.5% parameters, and achieves 37.3x speed up with only 2.8% mean of average precision (mAP) loss. On the sim2real detection data set for robotic detection task, the pruned YOLOv3 model achieves 9.6% better mAP than the baseline model, showing better robustness performance.

TI Channel-Correlation-Based Selective Knowledge Distillation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Channel correlation; channel knowledge; knowledge distillation (KD);
   relation knowledge
AB As a simple yet effective model compression method, knowledge distillation (or KD) is used to learn a small lightweight student network by transferring valuable knowledge from a pretrained cumbersome teacher network. However, existing KD methods usually consider the feature knowledge either in different layers or individual samples, failing to explore more detailed information in different channels from the perspective of sample relationships. Meanwhile, the negative influences contained in the teacher knowledge are also not well investigated, especially, when using the response-based knowledge. To address the above-mentioned issues, we devise a novel KD approach entitled channel correlation-based selective KD (or CCSKD). Specifically, to distill rich knowledge from feature representations, we not only consider the feature knowledge from different channels for individual samples but also take into account the relational knowledge based on per-channel features for different samples. Furthermore, to further distill positive response-based knowledge, a selective strategy is developed, i.e., selective KD, to progressively correct the negative influences from the teacher knowledge during the distillation process. We perform extensive experiments on three image classification data sets, CIFAR-100, Stanford Cars, and Tiny-ImageNet, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCSKD, which outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods with a clear margin. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/gjplab/ CCSKD.

AB As vehicular automation handles more aspects of the driving task, human drivers are taxed with increasing demands to monitor and handle rare automation failures. Staying vigilant imposes a high-cognitive workload and so is hypothesized to pose varying difficulties across the driving population, leading to differences in individual susceptibility to vigilance decrement. To investigate this, the present study proposes the use of an objective neurometric of mental workload to characterize drivers' severity of vigilance decrement during assisted driving with adaptive cruise control. Drivers performed a car-following task for approximately 1.5 h and performed emergency braking whenever the leading car brakes suddenly. The neurometric, frontal theta / parietal alpha ratio-measured from an alert-state driving period using a wearable electroencephalography headset-was found to be associated with the magnitude of drivers' behavioral changes (cumulative slowing and erraticity of their braking reaction times) over the course of the assisted driving tour. This is the first study to explore the use of an alert-state objective measure in profiling individuals' general susceptibility to vigilance decrements in assisted driving, which is highly relevant in the context of identifying higher risk drivers and designing driver-vehicle interaction systems to enhance automation use safety.

AB Using electroencephalogram (EEG) to recognize human emotion has attracted increasing attention. However, feature extraction from EEG is a challenging work because it is a nonstationary continuous sequential signal. To obtain more pattern information, a combined feature extraction method in the variational mode decomposition (VMD) domain is proposed, which can extract local features of EEG signals to overcome the effects caused by nonstationarity. This method first decomposes EEG into several components using VMD and then combined features of differential entropy (DE) and short-time energy (STE) are extracted from each component. To optimize combined features, the important features are selected by tree modes, and the feature set is dimensionally reduced by further using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Moreover, an XGBoost classifier with Bayesian optimization is presented to classify different emotional states. Binary-class and multiclass EEG emotion recognition are conducted on the DEAP data set, from which the experimental results show that accuracy of binary-class classification is 81.77% for high/low valence and 80.47% for high/low arousal, and accuracy of 91.41%, 94.27%, 94.27%, and 93.49% are obtained for HVHA, LVHA, LVLA, and HVLA, respectively, which demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB Complete coverage path planning (CCPP) requires the mobile robots to traverse every part of the workspace, which is one of the major challenges in cleaning robots and many other robotic systems. The biologically inspired neural network (BINN) algorithm has been extensively applied in path planning, recently. In this article, a new CCPP strategy with BINN is proposed. The planned path of cleaning robot is not only determined by the dynamic neural activities but also by the distribution of obstacles in the environmental map. By distinguishing the connectivity between different areas of the environmental map, and using the proposed path backtracking algorithm, the improved CCPP algorithm can autonomously plan a collision-free path and reduce the path repetition ratio. Besides, an improved dynamic deadlock escape algorithm is presented to select the optimal escape target point. The simulation results show that the proposed CCPP algorithm without any templates or learning procedures is able to generate an orderly path in both known and unknown environment.

   estimation; robot grasping; transfer learning
AB Transferring robotic grasping skills learned from a simulator to the real world is beneficial in reducing the cost of labeling. However, the models trained on synthetic data are brittle when being applied to real-world data due to the domain gap. In this article, we propose cycle-consistency, content-consistency, and mapping-consistency (CCM) pixel-level domain adaptation (Pixel-DA), a novel real-to-sim approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for object pose estimations, which outperforms conventional domain adaptation methods in preserving structural information, semantic information, and object pose during the transfer. The pipeline decouples domain adaptation and pose estimation, which allows the CCM Pixel-DA method to be integrated into state-of-the-art object pose estimation networks. The proposed method is further integrated into a pipeline for robot grasping. Experimental results on a real-world robot grasping system validate that the system is capable of grasping real-world objects without object pose annotations in the real-world domain.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB The cerebellum plays an important role in smooth and coordinated motor control. Precise control requires the cerebellum to regulate movements in both space and time domains. Although many cerebellar models have been proposed, most of them focus on motor coordination, motor learning, or timing distinctly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a cerebellar model which contributes to the proper execution of movements via motor learning that displays temporal specificity. In this article, we proposed a novel spiking neural network model to realize cerebellar processing with strong biomimicry, which is based on adapting rate neurons and has a cerebellum-inspired structure as well as biologically plausible cerebellar divergence/convergence ratios. The model was tested with the eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) experimental task. The simulation results verify that our implementation has improvements in both signal encoding and learning speed than previous studies. Furthermore, compared with neurophysiological data, our model shows a similar learning trend and can represent the fluctuation of the learning curves. It is demonstrated that our proposed cerebellar model experimentally reproduces the key features of the EBCC task and provides a new way to understand the timing and learning control neural mechanisms of the cerebellum.

AB Random sets are random variables whose values are sets. They are frequently interpreted as imprecise observations of random variables. In earlier papers the author has investigated how copulas can be used to describe the dependence between random sets. The aim of this paper is to investigate the probabilistic information induced by two random sets and a copula. Two specific sets of probability measures will be investigated: one consisting of the joint distributions of random variables contained in the random sets all having the same copula, and the other one consisting of all distributions covered by a random set in product space constructed from the marginal random sets and the copula. It is shown that even though, in general, none of the credal sets is a subset of the other one, for the special case when the marginal random sets are probability boxes the former credal set is a subset of the latter and that the lower and upper probabilities coincide on cylindrical sets. In addition, new results on random sets in the real line as well as random intervals and their joint distribution are presented.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ACCEPTABILITY; MAGNITUDE
AB Neural network language models appear to be increasingly aligned with how humans process and generate language, but identifying their weaknesses through adversarial examples is challenging due to the discrete nature of language and the complexity of human language perception. We bypass these limitations by turning the models against each other. We generate controversial sentence pairs where two language models disagree about which sentence is more likely to occur. Considering nine language models (including n-gram, recurrent neural networks and transformers), we created hundreds of controversial sentence pairs through synthetic optimization or by selecting sentences from a corpus. Controversial sentence pairs proved highly effective at revealing model failures and identifying models that aligned most closely with human judgements of which sentence is more likely. The most human-consistent model tested was GPT-2, although experiments also revealed substantial shortcomings in its alignment with human perception.

AB Large-scale simulations with complex electron interactions remain one of the greatest challenges for atomistic modelling. Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10 years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5 million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs.

AB Computational protein-binding studies are widely used to investigate fundamental biological processes and facilitate the development of modern drugs, vaccines and therapeutics. Scoring functions aim to assess and rank the binding strength of the predicted protein complex. However, accurate scoring of protein binding interfaces remains a challenge. Here we show that our evaluating Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks (PIsToN) approach can distinguish native-like protein complexes from incorrect conformations. Protein interfaces are transformed into a collection of two-dimensional images (interface maps), each corresponding to a geometric or biochemical property. Pixel intensities represent the feature values. A neural network was adapted from a popular vision transformer with several enhancements: a hybrid component to accept empirical-based energy terms, a multi-attention module to highlight essential features and binding sites, and the use of contrastive learning for better ranking performance. The resulting PIsToN model substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scoring functions on well-known datasets.

AB The aim of this study is to apply and evaluate the usefulness of the hybrid classifier to predict the presence of serious coronary artery disease based on clinical data and 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring. Our approach relies on an ensemble classifier applying the distributivity equation aggregating base classifiers accordingly. Such a method may be helpful for physicians in the management of patients with coronary artery disease, in particular in the face of limited access to invasive diagnostic tests, i.e., coronary angiography, or in the case of contraindications to its performance. The paper includes results of experiments performed on medical data obtained from the Department of Internal Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. The data set contains clinical data, data from Holter ECG (24-hour ECG monitoring), and coronary angiography. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique is used for the performance evaluation of the classifiers on a data set using the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) tool. We present the results of comparing our hybrid algorithm created from aggregation with the distributive equation of selected classification algorithms (multilayer perceptron network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and random forests) with themselves on raw data.

AB Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has been proven to be successful against different leukaemias and lymphomas. Its success has led, in recent years, to its use being tested for different solid tumours, including glioblastoma, a type of primary brain tumour, characterised by aggressiveness and recurrence. This paper presents an analytical study of a mathematical model describing the competition of CAR-T and glioblastoma tumour cells, taking into account their immunosuppressive capacity. The model is formulated in a general way, and its basic properties are investigated. However, most of the analysis considers the model with exponential tumour growth, assuming this growth type for simplicity. The existence and stability of steady states are studied, and the subsequent focus is on two different types of treatment: constant and periodic. Finally, protocols for CAR-T cell therapy of glioblastoma are numerically derived; these are aimed at preventing the tumour from reaching a critical size and at prolonging the patients' survival time as much as possible. The analytical and numerical results provide theoretical support for the treatment of glioblastoma using CAR-T cells.

AB The work studies the well-known map-based model of neuronal dynamics introduced in 2007 by Courbage, Nekorkin and Vdovin, important due to various medical applications. We also review and extend some of the existing results concerning beta-transformations and (expanding) Lorenz mappings. Then we apply them for deducing important properties of spike-trains generated by the CNV model and explain their implications for neuron behaviour. In particular, using recent theorems of rotation theory for Lorenz-like maps, we provide a classification of periodic spiking patterns in this model.

AB Acoustic features of speech are promising as objective markers for mental health monitoring. Specialized smartphone apps can gather such acoustic data without disrupting the daily activities of patients. Nonetheless, the psychiatric assessment of the patient's mental state is typically a sporadic occurrence that takes place every few months. Consequently, only a slight fraction of the acoustic data is labeled and applicable for supervised learning. The majority of the related work on mental health monitoring limits the considerations only to labeled data using a predefined ground-truth period. On the other hand, semi-supervised methods make it possible to utilize the entire dataset, exploiting the regularities in the unlabeled portion of the data to improve the predictive power of a model. To assess the applicability of semi-supervised learning approaches, we discuss selected state-of-the-art semi-supervised classifiers, namely, label spreading, label propagation, a semi-supervised support vector machine, and the self training classifier. We use real-world data obtained from a bipolar disorder patient to compare the performance of the different methods with that of baseline supervised learning methods. The experiment shows that semi-supervised learning algorithms can outperform supervised algorithms in predicting bipolar disorder episodes.

AB We show a turnpike result for problems of optimal control with possibly nonlinear systems as well as pointwise-in-time state and control constraints. The objective functional is of integral type and contains a tracking term which penalizes the distance to a desired steady state. In the optimal control problem, only the initial state is prescribed. We assume that a cheap control condition holds that yields a bound for the optimal value of our optimal control problem in terms of the initial data. We show that the solutions to the optimal control problems on the time intervals [0,T ] have a turnpike structure in the following sense: For large T the contribution to the objective functional that comes from the subinterval [T/2,T ], i.e., from the second half of the time interval [0,T ], is at most of the order 1/T . More generally, the result holds for subintervals of the form [r T,T ], where r is an element of (0, 1/2) is a real number. Using this result inductively implies that the decay of the integral on such a subinterval in the objective function is faster than the reciprocal value of a power series in T with positive coefficients. Accordingly, the contribution to the objective value from the final part of the time interval decays rapidly with a growing time horizon. At the end of the paper we present examples for optimal control problems where our results are applicable.

AB An event-triggered adaptive control algorithm is proposed for cooperative tracking control of high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with prescribed performance and full-state constraints. The algorithm combines dynamic surface technology and the backstepping recursive design method, with radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) used to approximate the unknown nonlinearity. The barrier Lyapunov function and finite-time stability theory are employed to prove that all agent states are semi-globally uniform and ultimately bounded, with the tracking error converging to a bounded neighborhood of zero in a finite time. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

In this control scheme, the hysteresis phenomenon inherent in the PEA is described by a Duhem submodel embedded between two linear dynamic submodels that describe the behavior of the drive amplifier and the flexible hinge with load, respectively, thus constituting a sandwich model with hysteresis. Based on this model, a nonsmooth predictor for sandwich systems with hysteresis is constructed. To avoid the complicated online search for the optimal value of the generalized gradient at a nonsmooth point, the method of the so-called weighted estimation of generalized gradient is proposed. In order to compensate for the model error caused by model uncertainty, a model error compensator (MEC) is integrated into the online optimization control strategy. Afterwards, the stability of the control system is analyzed based on Lyapunov's theory. Finally, the proposed NOC-MEC method is verified on an MPS with a PEA, and the corresponding experimental results are presented.

AB The design of incentive-compatible mechanisms for a certain class of finite Bayesian partially observable Markov games is proposed using a dynamic framework. We set forth a formal method that maintains the incomplete knowledge of both the Bayesian model and the Markov system's states. We suggest a methodology that uses Tikhonov's regularization technique to compute a Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the accompanying game mechanism. Our framework centers on a penalty function approach, which guarantees strong convexity of the regularized reward function and the existence of a singular solution involving equality and inequality constraints in the game. We demonstrate that the approach leads to a resolution with the smallest weighted norm. The resulting individually rational and ex post periodic incentive compatible system satisfies this requirement. We arrive at the analytical equations needed to compute the game's mechanism and equilibrium. Finally, using a supply chain network for a profit maximization problem, we demonstrate the viability of the proposed mechanism design.

AB The Lombard effect is an involuntary increase in the speaker's pitch, intensity, and duration in the presence of noise. It makes it possible to communicate in noisy environments more effectively. This study aims to investigate an efficient method for detecting the Lombard effect in uttered speech. The influence of interfering noise, room type, and the gender of the person on the detection process is examined. First, acoustic parameters related to speech changes produced by the Lombard effect are extracted. Mid-term statistics are built upon the parameters and used for the self-similarity matrix construction. They constitute input data for a convolutional neural network (CNN). The self-similarity-based approach is then compared with two other methods, i.e., spectrograms used as input to the CNN and speech acoustic parameters combined with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The experimental investigations show the superiority of the self-similarity approach applied to Lombard effect detection over the other two methods utilized. Moreover, small standard deviation values for the self-similarity approach prove the resulting high accuracies.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a long-term sleep disorder that causes temporary disruption in breathing while sleeping. Polysomnography (PSG) is the technique for monitoring different signals during the patient's sleep cycle, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Due to the high cost and inconvenience of polysomnography, the usefulness of ECG signals in detecting OSA is explored in this work, which proposes a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) model for detecting OSA using ECG signals. A publicly available apnea ECG database from PhysioNet is used for experimentation. Further, a constant Q-transform (CQT) is applied for segmentation, filtering, and conversion of ECG beats into images. The proposed CNN model demonstrates an average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 91.34%, 90.68% and 90.70%, respectively. The findings obtained using the proposed approach are comparable to those of many other existing methods for automatic detection of OSA.

DE Neural Architecture Search; Deep learning
AB Neural architecture search (NAS) is a framework for automating the design process of a neural network structure. While the recent one-shot approaches have reduced the search cost, there still exists an inherent trade-off between cost and performance. It is important to appropriately stop the search and further reduce the high cost of NAS. Meanwhile, the differentiable architecture search (DARTS), a typical one-shot approach, is known to suffer from overfitting. Heuristic early-stopping strategies have been proposed to overcome such performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a more versatile and principled early-stopping criterion on the basis of the evaluation of a gap between expectation values of generalisation errors of the previous and current search steps with respect to the architecture parameters. The stopping threshold is automatically determined at each search epoch without cost. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We stop the one-shot NAS algorithms and evaluate the acquired architectures on the benchmark datasets: NASBench-201 and NATS-Bench. Our algorithm is shown to reduce the cost of the search process while maintaining a high performance. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two widely used clinical imaging modalities for non-invasive diagnosis. However, both of these modalities come with certain problems. CT uses harmful ionising radiation, and MRI suffers from slow acquisition speed. Both problems can be tackled by undersampling, such as sparse sampling. However, such undersampled data leads to lower resolution and introduces artefacts. Several techniques, including deep learning based methods, have been proposed to reconstruct such data. However, the undersampled reconstruction problem for these two modalities was always considered as two different problems and tackled separately by different research works. This paper proposes a unified solution for both sparse CT and undersampled radial MRI reconstruction, achieved by applying Fourier transform-based pre-processing on the radial MRI and then finally reconstructing both modalities using sinogram upsampling com-bined with filtered back-projection. The Primal-Dual network is a deep learning based method for reconstructing sparsely-sampled CT data. This paper introduces Primal-Dual UNet, which improves the Primal-Dual network in terms of accuracy and reconstruction speed. The proposed method resulted in an average SSIM of 0.932+0.021 while performing sparse CT reconstruction for fan-beam geometry with a sparsity level of 16, achieving a statistically significant improvement over the previous model, which resulted in 0.919+0.016. Furthermore, the proposed model resulted in 0.903+0.019 and 0.957+0.023 average SSIM while reconstructing undersampled brain and abdominal MRI data with an acceleration factor of 16, respectively -statistically significant improvements over the original model, which resulted in 0.867+0.025 and 0.949+0.025. Finally, this paper shows that the proposed network not only improves the overall image quality, but also improves the image quality for the regions-of-interest: liver, kidneys, and spleen; as well as generalises better than the baselines in presence the of a needle.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID EMBEDDINGS
AB End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) which has the capability to directly output speaker diarization results and handle overlapping speech has attracted more and more attention due to its promising performance. Although existing EEND-based methods often outperform clustering-based methods, they cannot generalize well to unseen test sets because fixed attractors are often utilized to estimate speech activities of each speaker. An iterative adaptive attractor estimation (IAAE) network was proposed to refine diarization results, in which the self-attentive EEND (SA-EEND) was implemented to initialize diarization results and frame-wise embeddings. There are two main parts in the proposed IAAE network: an attention-based pooling was designed to obtain a rough estimation of the attractors based on the diarization results of the previous iteration, and an adaptive attractor was then calculated by using transformer decoder blocks. A unified training framework was proposed to further improve the diarization performance, making the embeddings more discriminable based on the well separated attractors. We evaluated the proposed method on both the simulated mixtures and the real CALLHOME dataset using the diarization error rate (DER). Our proposed method provides relative reductions in DER by up to 44.8% on simulated 2-speaker mixtures and 23.6% on the CALLHOME dataset over the baseline SA-EEND at the 2nd iteration step. We also demonstrated that with an increasing number of refinement steps applied, the DER on the CALLHOME dataset could be further reduced to 7.36%, achieving the state-of-the-art diarization results when compared with other methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes a mathematical model of Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Networks (SCLSCNs). When an outbreak occurs, environmental, economic, and social aspects can be traded off. A novelty aspect of this paper is its emphasis on hygiene costs. As well as healthcare education, prevention, and control of COVID-19, this model offers job opportunities related to COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 damages lead to lost days each year, which is one of the negative social aspects of this model. COVID-19 was associated with two environmental novelties in this study. positive and negative effects of COVID-19 can be observed in the environmental context. As a result, there has been an increase in medical waste disposal and plastic waste disposal. Multi-objective mathematical modeling whit Weighted Tchebycheff method scalarization. In this process, the software Lingo is used. The COVID-19 pandemic still has a lot of research gaps because it's a new disease. An SC model that is sustainable and hygienic will be developed to fill this gap in the COVID-19 condition disaster. Our new indicator of sustainability is demonstrated using a mixed-integer programming model with COVID-19-related issues in a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) overview.

AB In this paper, we have done a rapid and very simple algorithm that resolves the multiple objective combinatorial optimization problem. This, by determining a basic optimal solution, which is a strong spanning tree constructed, according to a well-chosen criterion. Consequently, our algorithm uses notions of Bellman's algorithm to determine the best path of the network, and Ford Fulkerson's algorithm to maximise the flow value. The Simplex Network Method that permits to reach the optimality conditions manipulates the two algorithms. In short, the interest of our work is the optimization of many criteria taking into account the strong spanning tree, which represents the central angular stone of the network. To illustrate that, we propose to optimize a bi-objective distribution problem.

AB Recently, air pollution has received much attention as a result of reflections on environmental issues. Accordingly, the hub location problem (HLP) seeks to find the optimal location of hub facilities and allocate points for them to meet the demands between source-destination pairs. Thus, in this study, decisions related to location and allocation in a hub network are reviewed and a multi-objective model is proposed for locating and allocating capacity-building facilities at different time periods over a planning horizon. The objective functions of the model presented in this study are to minimize costs, reduce air pollution by diminishing fuel consumption, and maximize job opportunities. In order to solve the given model, the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) along with innovative algorithms are utilized. The results presented a multi-objective sustainable model for full-covering HLP, and provided access to a hub network with minimum transport costs, fuel consumption, and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, and maximum job opportunities in each planning horizon utilizing MOICA (multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm) and GAMS to solve the proposed model. The study also assessed the performance of the proposed algorithms with the aid of the QM, MID, SM, and NSP indicators, acquired from comparing the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm based on some indicators, proving the benefit and efficiency of MOICA in all cases.

AB Locating facilities such as factories or warehouses is an important and strategic decision for any organization. Transportation costs, which often form a significant part of the price of goods offered, are a function of the location of the plans. To determine the optimal location of these designs, various methods have been proposed so far, which are generally definite (non-random). The main aim of the study, while introducing these specific algorithms, is to suggest a stochastic model of the location problem based on the existing models, in which random programming, as well as programming with random constraints are utilized. To do so, utilizing programming with random constraints, the stochastic model is transformed into a specific model that can be solved by using the latest algorithms or standard programming methods. Based on the results acquired, this proposed model permits us to attain more realistic solutions considering the random nature of demand. Furthermore, it helps attain this aim by considering other characteristics of the environment and the feedback between them.

AB Supply chains are one of the key tools in optimizing production and distribution simultaneously. However, information uncertainty is always a challenge in production and distribution management. The main purpose of this paper is to design a two-echelon supply chain in a multi-cycle state and in conditions of demand uncertainty. The task includes determining the number and location of distribution centers, planning capacity for active distribution centers, and determining the amount of shipments between different levels so that the total costs of the chain are minimized. Uncertainty is applied through discrete scenarios in the model and the problem is formulated by multi-stage stochastic programming method in the form of a mixed integer linear model. The results acquired using two indicators called VMS and VSS demonstrated that modeling the supply chain design problem with the multi-stage stochastic approach can result in significant costs reduction. Plus, utilizing mathematical expectation can generate misleading results, therefore resulting in the development of supply chain designs incapable of satisfying demand due to its overlooked limitations.

AB This study examines the issue of distribution network design in the supply chain system. There are many production factories and distribution warehouses in this issue. The most efficient strategy for distributing the product from the factory to the warehouse and from the warehouse to the customer is determined by solving this model. This model combines location problems with and without capacity limits to study a particular location problem. In this system, the cost of production and maintenance of the product in the factory and warehouse is a function of its output. This increases capacity without additional costs, and ultimately does not lose customers. This algorithm is a population-based, innovative method that systematically combines answers to obtain the most accurate answer considering quality and diversity. A two-phase recursive algorithm based on a scattered object has been developed to solve this model. Numerical results show the efficiency and effectiveness of this two-phase algorithm for problems of different sizes.

AB Adequate and desirable connections between suppliers and customers necessitate an appropriate flow of information. Therefore, a promising and proper data collaboration in the supply chain is of tremendous significance. Thus, the study's main objective is to provide multiple objective programming models under uncertain conditions to assess the performance of suppliers. To meet that aim, a case study for the reliability assessment of the presented model is carried out. That section is associated with supply chain visibility (SCV). Likewise, the likelihood of unpredicted and undesirable incidents involving supply chain risk (SCR) is taken into consideration. The intimate relation between visibility and risk of the supply chain is deemed efficient for the performance of the supply chain. Incoherence in maximization and minimization of SCR and SCV and other factors, including costs, capacity, or demand, necessitates multiple objective programming models to assess suppliers' performance to accomplish the before-mentioned aims. The study's results indicate the high reliability of the proposed model. Besides, the numeral results reveal that decision-makers in selecting suppliers mainly decrease SCR and then attempt to enhance SCV. In conclusion, the provided model in the study can be a desirable model for analyzing and estimating supplier performance with SCR and SCV simultaneously.

DE Cross-lingual transfer; adapter; low-resource languages; word alignment
AB Multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning. However, most mPLMs implicitly encourage cross-lingual alignment in pretraining stage, making it hard to capture accurate word alignment across languages. In this paper, we propose Word-align ADapters for Cross-lingual transfer (WAD-X) to explicitly align word representations of mPLMs via language-specific subspace. Taking a mPLM as the backbone model, WAD-X constructs subspace for each source-target language pair via adapters. The adapters use statistical alignment as the prior knowledge to guide word-level aligning in the corresponding bilingual semantic subspace. We evaluate our model across a set of target languages on three zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS), dependency parsing (DP), and sentiment analysis (SA). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on three benchmarks, with improvements of 2.19, 2.50, and 1.61 points in POS, DP, and SA tasks over strong baselines.

AB Social media is a common medium for expression of views, discussion, sharing of content, and promotion of products and ideas. These views are either polite or obscene. The growth of hate speech is one of the negative aspects of the medium and its emergence poses risk factors for society at various levels. Although there are rules and laws for these platforms, they cannot oversee and control all types of content. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop modern algorithms to automatically detect hateful content on social media. Arab society is not isolated from the world, and the usage of social media by its members has highlighted the importance of automated systems that help build an electronic society free of hate and aggression. This article aims to detect hate speech based on Arabic context over the Twitter platform by proposing different novel deep learning architectures in order to provide a thorough analytical study. Also, a comparative study is presented with a different well-known machine learning algorithm, as well as other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature to be used as a beacon for interested researchers. These models have been applied to the Arabic tweets dataset, which included 15K tweets and 14 features. After training these models, the results obtained for the top two models included an improved bidirectional long short-term memory with an accuracy of 92.20% and a macro F1-score of 92% and a modified convolutional neural network with an accuracy of 92.10% and a macro F1-score of 91%. The results also showed the superiority of the performance of the deep learning models over other models in terms of accuracy.

AB With the rapid growth of digital content, there is a need for an automatic text summarizer to provide short text from a long text document. Many research works have been presented for extractive text summarization (ETS). This article mainly focuses on the graph-based ETS approach for multiple Telugu text documents. A modified Text-Rank algorithm is employed with the noun and verb count of each sentence in the text as the initial score of each node. To get the optimal features, a novel feature selection algorithm called improved Flamingo Search Algorithm is proposed in this article. Though graph-based ETS is an important approach, the generated summaries are redundant. To reduce the redundancy in the generated summary, maximum marginal relevance is combined with the modified Text-Rank. Different word-embedding techniques such as Fast-Text, Word2vec, TF-IDF, and one-hot encoding are utilized to experiment with the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed text summarization approach is evaluated with BLEU and ROUGE in terms of F-measure, precision, and recall.

AB Sign language serves as a bridge between the hearing-impaired and other people. Existing sensor-based approaches tend to only collect data from the dominant hand. Does this signal collection method affect the accuracy of gesture recognition, especially gestures where the dominant hand has the same movement while the non-dominant hand has different movements? The specific gestures are called same-right-and-different-left (SRDL) where the right hand is dominant. This article is the first to propose an SRDL-aware sign language recognition system. First, an SRDL discriminator based on an autoencoder and range classifier is designed to determine whether the gesture is SRDL. Second, an SRDL feature selector based on clustering relationship is presented. Multivariate variational mode decomposition and fast fourier transform are used to obtain the feature expression. Moreover, a clustering relationship algorithm is proposed to dynamically select features for every group of SRDL gestures in the feature expression. Finally, the experimental results show that the average word error rate is 14.3% and decreases by 8.5% and 12.1% compared with Signspeaker and MyoSign, respectively.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB With the advent of the Internet, social media platforms have witnessed an enormous increase in user-generated textual and visual content. Microblogs on platforms such as Twitter are extremely useful for comprehending how individuals feel about a specific issue through their posted texts, images, and videos. Owing to the plethora of content generated, it is necessary to derive an insight of its emotional and sentimental inclination. Individuals express themselves in a variety of languages and, lately, the number of people preferring native languages has been consistently increasing. Marathi language is predominantly spoken in the Indian state ofMaharashtra. However, sentiment analysis in Marathi has rarely been addressed. In light of the above, we propose an emotion-aware multimodal Marathi sentiment analysis method (MahaEmoSen). Unlike the existing studies, we leverage emotions embedded in tweets besides assimilating the content-based information from the textual and visual modalities of social media posts to perform a sentiment classification. We mitigate the problem of small training sets by implementing data augmentation techniques. A word-level attention mechanism is applied on the textual modality for contextual inference and filtering out noisy words from tweets. Experimental outcomes on real-world social media datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods for Marathi sentiment analysis in resource-constrained circumstances.

AB Neural approaches, which are currently state-of-the-art in many areas, have contributed significantly to the exciting advancements in machine translation. However, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) requires a substantial quantity and good quality parallel training data to train the best model. A large amount of training data, in turn, increases the underlying vocabulary exponentially. Therefore, several proposed methods have been devised for relatively limited vocabulary due to constraints of computing resources such as systemmemory. Encoding words as sequences of subword units for so-called open-vocabulary translation is an effective strategy for solving this problem. However, the conventional methods for splitting words into subwords focus on statistics-based approaches that mainly conform to agglutinative languages. In these languages, the morphemes have relatively clean boundaries. Thesemethods still need to be thoroughly investigated for their applicability to fusion languages, which is the main focus of this article. Phonological and orthographic processes alter the borders of constituent morphemes of aword in fusion languages. Therefore, itmakes it difficult to distinguish the actual morphemes that carry syntactic or semantic information from the word's surface form, the form of the word as it appears in the text. We, thus, resorted to a word segmentation method that segments words by restoring the altered morphemes. We also compared conventional and morpheme-based NMT subword models. We could prove that morpheme-basedmodels outperform conventional subword models on a benchmark dataset.

AB With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainablework, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.

AB South and North Korea both use the Korean language. However, Korean natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on South Korean language. Therefore, existing NLP systems in the Korean language, such as neural machine translation (NMT) systems, cannot properly process North Korean inputs. Training a model using North Korean data is the most straightforward approach to solving this problem, but the data to train NMT models are insufficient. To solve this problem, we constructed a parallel corpus to develop a North Korean NMT model using a comparable corpus. We manually aligned parallel sentences to create evaluation data and automatically aligned the remaining sentences to create training data. We trained a North Korean NMT model using our North Korean parallel data and improved North Korean translation quality using South Korean resources such as parallel data and a pre-trained model. In addition, we propose Korean-specific pre-processing methods, character tokenization, and phoneme decomposition to use the South Korean resources more efficiently. We demonstrate that the phoneme decomposition consistently improves the North Korean translation accuracy compared to other pre-processing methods.

ID SPEECH SYNTHESIS
AB Vocoding is a sub-process of text-to-speech task, which aims at generating audios from intermediate representations between text and audio. Several recent works have shown that generative adversarial network(GAN) based vocoders can generate audios with high quality. While GAN-based neural vocoders have shown higher efficiency in generating speed than autoregressive vocoders, the audio fidelity still cannot compete with ground-truth samples. One major cause of the degradation in audio quality and spectrogram vague comes from the average pooling layers in discriminator. As the multi-scale discriminator commonly used by recent GAN-based vocoders applies several average pooling layers to capture different-frequency bands, we believe it is crucial to prevent the high-frequency information from leakage in the average pooling process. This article proposesMSCGAN, which solves the above-mentioned problem and achieves higher-fidelity speech synthesis. We demonstrate that substituting the average pooling process with a multi-scale convolution architecture effectively retains high-frequency features and thus forces the generator to recover audio details in time and frequency domain. Compared with other state-of-the-art GAN-based vocoders, MSCGAN can produce competitive audio with a higher spectrogram clarity and mean opinion score score in subjective human evaluation.

AB Exponential growth of electronic data requires advanced multi-label classification approaches for the development of natural language processing (NLP) applications such as recommendation systems, drug reaction detection, hate speech detection, and opinion recognition/mining. To date, several machine and deep learning-based multi-label classification methodologies have been proposed for English, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, and other developed languages. Urdu is the 11th largest language in the world and has no computer-aided multi-label textual news classification approach. Unlike other languages, Urdu is lacking multi-label text classification datasets that can be used to benchmark the performance of existing machine and deep learning methodologies. With an aim to accelerate and expedite research for the development of Urdu multi-label text classification-based applications, this article provides multiple contributions as follows: First, it provides a manually annotated multi-label textual news classification dataset for the Urdu language. Second, it benchmarks the performance of traditional machine learning approaches particularly by adapting three data transformation approaches along with three top-performing machine learning classifiers and four algorithm adaptation-based approaches. Third, it benchmarks performance of 16 existing deep learning approaches and the four most widely used language models. Finally, it provides an ensemble approach that reaps the benefits of three different deep learning architectures to precisely predict different classes associated with a particular Urdu textual document. Experimental results reveal that proposed ensemble approach performance values (87% accuracy, 92% F1-score, and 8% hamming loss) are significantly higher than adapted machine and deep learning-based approaches.

AB There are about 6,000 languages worldwide, most of which are low-resource languages. Although the current speech synthesis (or text-to-speech, TTS) for major languages (e.g., Mandarin, English, French) has achieved good results, the voice quality of TTS for low-resource languages (e.g., Tibetan) still needs to be further improved. Because prosody plays a significant role in natural speech, the article proposes two sequence-tosequence (seq2seq) Tibetan TTS models with prosodic information fusion to improve the voice quality of synthesized Tibetan speech. We first constructed a large-scale Tibetan corpus for seq2seq TTS. Then we designed a prosody generator to extract prosodic information from the Tibetan sentences. Finally, we trained two seq2seq Tibetan TTS models by fusing prosodic information, including feature-level and model-level prosodic information fusion. The experimental results showed that the proposed two seq2seq Tibetan TTS models, which fuse prosodic information, could effectively improve the voice quality of synthesized speech. Furthermore, the model-level prosodic information fusion only needs 60% similar to 70% of the training data to synthesize a voice similar to the baseline seq2seq Tibetan TTS. Therefore, the proposed prosodic information fusion methods can improve the voice quality of synthesized speech for low-resource languages.

AB Inspired by a real-world textile packing process, this paper investigates a novel hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with batch processing machines to minimize the makespan. Geometry sizes of textile products, non-identical capacities of packing machines, and the capacity of the needle detector are addressed in parallel-batching modes. To make batching and sequencing decisions simultaneously, a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is formulated. Then, a matheuristic method, Tabu Search with Fixing and Optimization (TSFO), is developed. Using tabu search to determine which variables to be fixed, the MILP is solved through a fix-and-optimize process. The results of extensive computational experiments show that the TSFO yields better solutions within much less computation time than solving the model directly in a commercial solver. Furthermore, the TSFO also outperforms an existing method in a special case from literature. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The employment of foundation models is steadily expanding, especially with the launch of ChatGPT and the release of other foundation models. These models have shown the potential of emerging capabilities to solve problems without being particularly trained to solve them. A previous work demonstrated these emerging capabilities in affective computing tasks; the performance quality was similar to that of traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques but fell short of specialized trained models, like fine-tuning of the RoBERTa language model. In this work, we extend this by exploring whether ChatGPT has novel knowledge that would enhance existing specialized models when they are fused together. We achieve this by investigating the utility of verbose responses from ChatGPT for solving a downstream task in addition to studying the utility of fusing that with existing NLP methods. The study is conducted on three affective computing problems: namely, sentiment analysis, suicide tendency detection, and big-five personality assessment. The results conclude that ChatGPT has, indeed, novel knowledge that can improve existing NLP techniques by way of fusion, be it early or late fusion.

AB Fact verification is a very challenging task that requires retrieving multiple evidence sentences from a reliable corpus to authenticate claims. Many claims require the simultaneous integration and reasoning of several pieces of evidence for verification. Existing models exhibit limitations in two aspects: 1) during the sentence selection stage, they only consider the interaction between the claim and the evidence, disregarding the intersentence information, and 2) most fusion strategies employed in current research, such as addition, concatenation, or simple neural networks, fail to capture the relationships and logical information among the evidence. To alleviate these problems, we propose select and fact verification modeling (SFVM). Our model utilizes a multihead self-attention mechanism combined with a gating mechanism to facilitate sentence interaction and enhance sentence embeddings. Then, we utilize factorization machines to effectively express the compressed alignment vectors, which are then used to expand the representations of the base evidence. To distinguish the importance of features, we use the evidence fusion network to determine the importance of various feature interactions. Results from experiments on the two public datasets showed that SFVM can utilize richer information between the claim and the evidence for fact verification and achieve competitive performance on the FEVER dataset.

AB Interpretable policy distillation aims to imitate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy into a self-explainable model. However, the distilled policy usually does not generalize well to complex tasks. To investigate this phenomenon, we examine the experience pools of DRL tasks and find that these interactive experience distributions are heavy tailed. However, this critical issue is largely ignored by existing approaches, and, thus, they do not fully unitize the less frequent but very critical experience points. To address this issue, we propose characterizing decision boundaries via the minimum experience retention to deal with the heavy-tailed experience distributions. Our method identifies critical experience points that are close to the model's decision boundaries, and such experience points are more critical because they portray the prerequisite of a model to take an action. As a result, our method distills the DRL policy to a self-explainable structure without a neural structure and ambiguous intermediate parameters. Through experiments on six games, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in cumulative rewards, stability, and faithfulness.

Even if, at some point, computers may be able to provide diagnoses with greater accuracy than medical professionals, would ethics be the only safeguard against the possible risks? In this article, we implement a pragmatic approach to answer this question by focusing on possible outcomes concerning "potential patients." We define a "potential patient" as an individual who has not yet shown obvious or early signs of disease. Through the outcomes and inferences derived from big data analysis, such a patient could potentially require early treatment, more accurate diagnoses, and medications that are better adapted to the patient's conditions.

AB With the continuous advancement of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction can forecast the future degradation state of machinery and then estimate the remaining service time before it loses its safe operation ability. Accordingly, a series of predictive maintenance strategies can be regulated in advance for equipment in the Industrial Internet of Things. To tackle the challenges of insufficiency of failure data and lack of confidence in RUL prediction results, a similarity-based relevance vector machine (SRVM) is proposed in this article. Primarily, the relationship among latent variables in the SRVM is learned adaptively through similarity computations to fully utilize the limited degradation data. Furthermore, these internal variables in the SRVM are treated as time-varying variables and re-estimated dynamically to provide RUL prediction with reliable confidence. The experiment results show that the prediction accuracy of the SRVM is higher than that of other baseline methods.

AB Multihop reasoning is essential in knowledge graph (KG) research and applications. Current methods rely on specific KG entities, while human cognition operates at a more abstract level. This article proposes a category-aware rule-based (CRule) approach for symbolic multihop reasoning. Specifically, given a KG, CRule first categorizes entities and constructs a category-aware KG; it then uses rules retrieved from the categorized KG to perform multihop reasoning on the original KG. Experiments on five datasets show that CRule is simple, is effective, and combines the advantages of symbolic and neural network methods. It overcomes symbolic reasoning's complexity limitations, can perform reasoning on KGs of more than 300,000 edges, and can be three times more efficient than neural network models.

AB Date palm production is critical to oasis agriculture, owing to its economic importance and nutritional advantages. Numerous diseases endanger this precious tree, putting a strain on the economy and environment. White scale Parlatoria blanchardi is a damaging bug that degrades the quality of dates. When an infestation reaches a specific degree, it might result in the tree's death. To counter this threat, precise detection of infected leaves and its infestation degree is important to decide if chemical treatment is necessary. This decision is crucial for farmers who wish to minimize yield losses while preserving production quality. For this purpose, we propose a feature extraction and machine learning (ML) technique based framework for classifying the stages of infestation by white scale disease (WSD) in date palm trees by investigating their leaflets images. 80 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features and 9 hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color moments features are extracted from both grayscale and color images of the used dataset. To classify the WSD into its four classes (healthy, low infestation degree, medium infestation degree, and high infestation degree), two types of ML algorithms were tested; classical machine learning methods, namely, support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and ensemble learning methods such as random forest (RF) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: the first is composed of the extracted GLCM features only, and the second combines GLCM and HSV descriptors. The results indicate that SVM classifier outperformed on combined GLCM and HSV features with an accuracy of 98.29%. The proposed framework could be beneficial to the oasis agricultural community in terms of early detection of date palm white scale disease (DPWSD) and assisting in the adoption of preventive measures to protect both date palm trees and crop yield.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial sectors. It is designed to implicate embedded technologies in manufacturing fields to enhance their operations. However, IIoT involves some security vulnerabilities that are more damaging than those of IoT. Accordingly, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been developed to forestall inevitable harmful intrusions. IDSs survey the environment to identify intrusions in real time. This study designs an intrusion detection model exploiting feature engineering and machine learning for IIoT security. We combine Isolation Forest (IF) with Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) to reduce computational cost and prediction time. IF is exploited to detect and remove outliers from datasets. We apply PCC to choose the most appropriate features. PCC and IF are applied exchangeably (PCCIF and IFPCC). The Random Forest (RF) classifier is implemented to enhance IDS performances. For evaluation, we use the Bot-IoT and NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 datasets. RF-PCCIF and RF-IFPCC show noteworthy results with 99.98% and 99.99% Accuracy (ACC) and 6.18 s and 6.25 s prediction time on Bot-IoT, respectively. The two models also score 99.30% and 99.18% ACC and 6.71 s and 6.87 s prediction time on NF-UNSW-NB15-v2, respectively. Results prove that our designed model has several advantages and higher performance than related models.

AB Temporal ontologies allow to represent not only concepts, their properties, and their relationships, but also time-varying information through explicit versioning of definitions or through the four-dimensional perdurantist view. They are widely used to formally represent temporal data semantics in several applications belonging to different fields (e.g., Semantic Web, expert systems, knowledge bases, big data, and artificial intelligence). They facilitate temporal knowledge representation and discovery, with the support of temporal data querying and reasoning. However, there is no standard or consensual temporal ontology query language. In a previous work, we have proposed an approach named tau JOWL (temporal OWL 2 from temporal JSON, where OWL 2 stands for "OWL 2 Web Ontology Language" and JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"). tau JOWL allows (1) to automatically build a temporal OWL 2 ontology of data, following the Closed World Assumption (CWA), from temporal JSON-based big data, and (2) to manage its incremental maintenance accommodating their evolution, in a temporal and multi-schema-version environment. In this paper, we propose a temporal ontology query language for tau JOWL, named tau SQWRL (temporal SQWRL), designed as a temporal extension of the ontology query language-Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language (SQWRL). The new language has been inspired by the features of the consensual temporal query language TSQL2 (Temporal SQL2), well known in the temporal (relational) database community. The aim of the proposal is to enable and simplify the task of retrieving any desired ontology version or of specifying any (complex) temporal query on time-varying ontologies generated from time-varying big data. Some examples, in the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) domain, are provided to motivate and illustrate our proposal.

AB This paper deals with detecting fetal electrocardiogram FECG signals from single-channel abdominal lead. It is based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with advanced mathematical methods, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and a dimension-reduction technique like Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Due to the highly disproportionate frequency of the fetus's heart rate compared to the mother's, the time-scale representation clearly distinguishes the fetal electrical activity in terms of energy. Furthermore, we can disentangle the various components of fetal ECG, which serve as inputs to the CNN model to optimize the actual FECG signal, denoted by FECGr, which is recovered using the SVD-ICA process. The findings demonstrate the efficiency of this innovative approach, which may be deployed in real-time.

AB Cloud computing (CC) is a novel technology that has made it easier to access network and computer resources on demand such as storage and data management services. In addition, it aims to strengthen systems and make them useful. Regardless of these advantages, cloud providers suffer from many security limits. Particularly, the security of resources and services represents a real challenge for cloud technologies. For this reason, a set of solutions have been implemented to improve cloud security by monitoring resources, services, and networks, then detect attacks. Actually, intrusion detection system (IDS) is an enhanced mechanism used to control traffic within networks and detect abnormal activities. This paper presents a cloud-based intrusion detection model based on random forest (RF) and feature engineering. Specifically, the RF classifier is obtained and integrated to enhance accuracy (ACC) of the proposed detection model. The proposed model approach has been evaluated and validated on two datasets and gives 98.3% ACC and 99.99% ACC using Bot-IoT and NSL-KDD datasets, respectively. Consequently, the obtained results present good performances in terms of ACC, precision, and recall when compared to the recent related works.

AB The development of hand gesture recognition systems has gained more attention in recent days, due to its support of modern human-computer interfaces. Moreover, sign language recognition is mainly developed for enabling communication between deaf and dumb people. In conventional works, various image processing techniques like segmentation, optimization, and classification are deployed for hand gesture recognition. Still, it limits the major problems of inefficient handling of large dimensional datasets and requires more time consumption, increased false positives, error rate, and misclassification outputs. Hence, this research work intends to develop an efficient hand gesture image recognition system by using advanced image processing techniques. During image segmentation, skin color detection and morphological operations are performed for accurately segmenting the hand gesture portion. Then, the Heuristic Manta-ray Foraging Optimization (HMFO) technique is employed for optimally selecting the features by computing the best fitness value. Moreover, the reduced dimensionality of features helps to increase the accuracy of classification with a reduced error rate. Finally, an Adaptive Extreme Learning Machine (AELM) based classification technique is employed for predicting the recognition output. During results validation, various evaluation measures have been used to compare the proposed model's performance with other classification approaches.

ID LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS
AB Human Action Recognition (HAR) attempts to recognize the human action from images and videos. The major challenge in HAR is the design of an action descriptor that makes the HAR system robust for different environments. A novel action descriptor is proposed in this study, based on two independent spatial and spectral filters. The proposed descriptor uses a Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter to extract scale-invariant features and a Difference of Wavelet (DoW) filter to extract spectral information. To create a composite feature vector for a particular test action picture, the Discriminant of Guassian (DoG) and Difference of Wavelet (DoW) features are combined. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a widely used dimensionality reduction technique, is also used to eliminate duplicate data. Finally, a closest neighbor method is used to classify the dataset. Weizmann and UCF 11 datasets were used to run extensive simulations of the suggested strategy, and the accuracy assessed after the simulations were run on Weizmann datasets for five-fold cross validation is shown to perform well. The average accuracy of DoG+ DoW is observed as 83.6635% while the average accuracy of Discrinanat of Guassian (DoG) and Difference of Wavelet (DoW) is observed as 80.2312% and 77.4215%, respectively. The average accuracy measured after the simulation of proposed methods over UCF 11 action dataset for five-fold cross validation DoG + DoW is observed as 62.5231% while the average accuracy of Difference of Guassian (DoG) and Difference of Wavelet (DoW) is observed as 60.3214% and 58.1247%, respectively. From the above accuracy observations, the accuracy of Weizmann is high compared to the accuracy of UCF 11, hence verifying the effectiveness in the improvisation of recognition accuracy.

AB Passive image forgery detection methods that identify forgeries without prior knowledge have become a key research focus. In copy-move forgery, the assailant intends to hide a portion of an image by pasting other portions of the same image. The detection of such manipulations in images has great demand in legal evidence, forensic investigation, and many other fields. The paper aims to present copy-move forgery detection algorithms with the help of advanced feature descriptors, such as local ternary pattern, local phase quantization, local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence, Weber local descriptor, and local monotonic pattern, and classifiers such as optimized support vector machine and optimized NBC. The proposed algorithms can classify an image efficiently as either copy-move forged or authenticated, even if the test image is subjected to attacks such as JPEG compression, scaling, rotation, and brightness variation. CoMoFoD, CASIA, and MICC datasets and a combination of CoMoFoD and CASIA datasets images are used to quantify the performance of the proposed algorithms. The proposed algorithms are more efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms even though the suspected image is post-processed.

AB Fluidic Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is a complex petrochemical process affected by many highly non-linear and interrelated factors. Product yield analysis, flue gas desulfurization prediction, and abnormal condition warning are several key research directions in FCC. This paper will sort out the relevant research results of the existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to the analysis and optimization of catalytic cracking processes, with a view to providing help for the follow-up research. Compared with the traditional mathematical mechanism method, the AI method can effectively solve the difficulties in FCC process modeling, such as high-dimensional, nonlinear, strong correlation, and large delay. AI methods applied in product yield analysis build models based on massive data. By fitting the functional relationship between operating variables and products, the excessive simplification of mechanism model can be avoided, resulting in high model accuracy. AI methods applied in flue gas desulfurization can be usually divided into two stages: modeling and optimization. In the modeling stage, data-driven methods are often used to build the system model or rule base; In the optimization stage, heuristic search or reinforcement learning methods can be applied to find the optimal operating parameters based on the constructed model or rule base. AI methods, including data-driven and knowledge-driven algorithms, are widely used in the abnormal condition warning. Knowledge-driven methods have advantages in interpretability and generalization, but disadvantages in construction difficulty and prediction recall. While the data-driven methods are just the opposite. Thus, some studies combine these two methods to obtain better results.

AB Cyber-physical systems often operate in dynamic environments where unexpected events should be managed while guaranteeing acceptable behavior. Providing comprehensive evidence of their dependability under change represents a major open challenge. In this article, we exploit the notion of equilibrium, that is, the ability of the system to maintain an acceptable behavior within its multidimensional viability zone and propose RUNE2 (RUNtime Equilibrium verification and Enforcement), an approach able to verify at runtime the equilibrium condition and to enforce the system to stay in its viability zone. RUNE2 includes (i) a system specification that takes into account the uncertainties related to partial knowledge and possible changes; (ii) the computation of the equilibrium condition to define the boundaries of the viability zone; (iii) a runtime equilibrium verification method that leverages Bayesian inference to reason about the ability of the system to remain viable; and (iv) a resilience enforcement mechanism that exploits the posterior knowledge to steer the execution of the system inside the viability zone. We demonstrate both benefits and costs of the proposed approach by conducting an empirical evaluation using two case studies and 24 systems synthetically generated from pseudo-random models with increasing structural complexity.

AB Smart homes are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) where multiple devices and controllers cooperate to achieve high-level goals. Causal knowledge on relations between system entities is essential for enabling system self-adaption to dynamic changes. As house configurations are diverse, this knowledge is difficult to obtain. In previous work, we proposed to generate Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) as follows. Starting with considering all possible relations, we progressively discarded non-correlated variables. Next, we identified causal relations from the remaining correlations by employing "do-operations." The obtained CBN could then be employed for causal inference. The main challenges of this approach included "non-doable variables" and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose three extensions: (i) early pruning weakly correlated relations to reduce the number of required do-operations, (ii) introducing aggregate variables that summarize relations between weakly coupled sub-systems, and (iii) applying the method a second time to perform indirect do interventions and handle non-doable relations. We illustrate and evaluate the efficiency of these contributions via examples from the smart home and power grid domain. Our proposal leads to a decrease in the number of operations required to learn the CBN and in an increased accuracy of the learned CBN, paving the way toward applications in large CPS.

AB In today's world, circumstances, processes, and requirements for software systems are becoming increasingly complex. To operate properly in such dynamic environments, software systems must adapt to these changes, which has led to the research area of Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS). Platooning is one example of adaptive systems in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is the ability of vehicles to travel with close inter-vehicle distances. This technology leads to an increase in road throughput and safety, which directly addresses the increased infrastructure needs due to increased traffic on the roads. However, the No-Free-Lunch theorem states that the performance of one adaptation planning strategy is not necessarily transferable to other problems. Moreover, especially in the field of SAS, the selection of the most appropriate strategy depends on the current situation of the system. In this article, we address the problem of self-aware optimization of adaptation planning strategies by designing a framework that includes situation detection, strategy selection, and parameter optimization of the selected strategies. We apply our approach on the case study platooning coordination and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

DE Very fast decision tree; noisy data streams; data stream mining; heart
   disease prediction
AB Building machine learning algorithms for real-time clinical decision support systems has become a current research hotspot. The success of these algorithms depends on their ability to handle data stream characteristics. For example, we cite as characteristics the large amounts of data, the high speed and rate of incoming data, and the change in data nature and distribution over time. The Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) is a method for incrementally building decision trees. Since its proposition in the literature, it has become one of the most popular tools for data stream classification. This paper aims to optimize a new version of VFDT called McDiarmid Tree (MT) for the early prediction of heart diseases in real-time clinical decision support systems. The proposed method for improving MT performance consists of two main mechanisms: detecting the presence of missing and meaningless values in data attributes and handling the impact of this presence. The proposed MT has been compared with MT and VFDT. Simulation results show that the proposed MT attains significantly higher prediction accuracy with less time and model cost (RAM-Hours) than the other two algorithms.

AB Agriculture assisted by Internet of Things (IoT) is termed as smart agriculture, which offers an increase in precision farming. Soil monitoring with IoT technology helps in the increase of agriculture by growing the yield through measuring accurate soil content information, like temperature, nutrition content, humidity, potential of hydrogen (PH), moisture and so on. In this research, the soil moisture and heat level is measured through an optimized deep learning technique namely, Sine Cosine Horse Herd optimization-based Deep Recurrent Neural Network (SCHHO-based Deep RNN). Here, the moisture and heat level is predicted using Deep RNN in which its weights are trained using SCHHO. In order to progress the effectiveness of prediction, the feature selection is done prior to prediction for choosing the appropriate features using weighted correlation coefficient. In addition, the gathered soil information is transmitted to the IoT nodes using SCHHO routing algorithm by considering fitness measures. Besides, the experimental outcome proves that the SCHHO-based Deep RNN algorithm provides better performance with the accuracy and precision of 0.918 and 0.908, respectively.

In this paper, we present the taxonomy of association patterns analysis approaches in depth. The association patterns analysis is based on support constraints, interestingness, and patterns dimension from different levels of abstraction. An in-depth research statistical view is presented in each category of the association patterns analysis research. Among the identified association rule mining research categories, we have selected rare pattern mining for further exploration of our study. Analysis of rare patterns is very much helpful in determining the rare relationships between patterns. Also, we will identify novel rare data patterns analysis techniques to solve the various problems in real-life applications. The overall research impact in the association rule mining research domain can be found in this review article. It will focus on various research scopes and the future directions of rule mining as well as rare pattern mining research.

AB Aim: The research aims at developing a traffic prediction and signal controlling model based on deep learning technique in order to provide congestion-free transportation in Intelligent Transport System (ITS).Need for the Research: Recent technical advancements in the ITS, industrialization, and urbanization increase traffic congestion, which leads to high fuel consumption and health issues. This signifies the need for a dynamic traffic management system to handle the traffic congestion issues that negatively affect the transportation service.Methods: For promoting congestion-free transportation in the ITS, this research aims to devise a traffic prediction and control system based on deep learning techniques that effectively controls the traffic during peak hours. The proposed mode-search optimization effectively clusters the vehicles based on the necessity. In addition, the mode-search optimization tunes the optimal hyperparameters of the deep Long Short Term Memory classifier, which minimizes the training loss. Further, the traffic signal control system is developed through the mode-search-based deep LSTM classifier for predicting the path of the vehicles by analyzing the attributes, such as velocity, acceleration, jitter, and priority of the vehicles.Result: The experimental results evaluate the efficacy of the traffic prediction model in terms of quadratic mean of acceleration (QMA), jitter, standard deviation of travel time (SDTT), and throughput, for which the values are found to be 37.43, 0.23, 8.75, and 100 respectively.Achievements: The proposed method attains the performance improvement of 5% to 42% when compared with the conventional methods.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. Traditional diagnosis methods of ADHD focus on observed behavior and reported symptoms, which may lead to a misdiagnosis. Studies have focused on computer-aided systems to improve the objectivity and accuracy of ADHD diagnosis by utilizing psychophysiological data measured from devices such as EEG and MRI. Despite their performance, their low accessibility has prevented their widespread adoption. We propose a novel ADHD prediction method based on the pupil size dynamics measured using eye tracking. Such data typically contain missing values owing to anomalies including blinking or outliers, which negatively impact the classification. We therefore applied an end-to-end deep learning model designed to impute the dynamic pupil size data and predict ADHD simultaneously. We used the recorded dataset of an experiment involving 28 children with ADHD and 22 children as a control group. Each subject conducted an eight-second visuospatial working memory task 160 times. We treated each trial as an independent data sample. The proposed model effectively imputes missing values and outperforms other models in predicting ADHD (AUC of 0.863). Thus, given its high accessibility and low cost, the proposed approach is promising for objective ADHD diagnosis.

AB The Spotted Hyena Optimization (SHO) algorithm is inspired by simulating the predatory behavior of spotted hyenas. While the mathematical model of the SHO algorithm is simple and optimal, it is easy to fall into local optimization and causes premature convergence compared to some metaheuristic algorithms. To the end, we propose an enhanced Spotted Hyena Optimization algorithm, a hybrid SHO algorithm using Elite Opposition-Based Learning coupled with the Simplex Method called EOBL-SM-SHO. The EOBL-SM-SHO algorithm combines the characteristics of the simplex method's geometric transformations (reflection, inside contraction, expansion, and outside contraction) with more practical information on elite opposition-based learning strategy. They can significantly strengthen the SHO algorithm's search range and augment the hyena population's diversity. Furthermore, we employ eleven benchmark functions and three engineering design issues to gauge the effectiveness of the EOBL-SM-SHO algorithm. Our extensive experimental results unveil that EOBL-SM-SHO achieves better accuracy and convergence rate than the state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO), Cuckoo Search (CS), Farmland Fertility Algorithm (FFA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO)).

Despite the extensive attention that certain modalities have already received, say per the textual information, there are several aspects that get disproportional attention throughout the bibliography. An instance of such a modality is the block diagrams found in the technical document, as they can provide crucial information about the functionality and the technical details of both their related parts and the technical document as a whole. This paper deals with the automatic understanding of block diagrams and the extraction of pseudocode associated with the functionality of a given diagram. In particular we present a complete methodology for the formal modelling of digital block diagrams and their elements, then we develop a generative framework and three novel annotated datasets on diagrams classification and captioning. After mapping the initial problem to a block diagram description task, we present several original predictive setups derived from image segmentation, analyze the inference capabilities, and we offer illustrative examples justifying our approach.

DE Color generation; color names; word embeddings; neural networks
ID LANGUAGE
AB Color serves as an important cue in graphics, arts and in many computer vision applications. We reliably and effortlessly name colors and communicate them with their names. However, many applications such as graphics, color design, palette generation and color selection tools demand numerical values of colors. Predicting and communicating colors by their numerical values is less intuitive and difficult task as it is a mapping of millions of colors for a specific color space. To bridge the gap between linguistic color names and numerical color values, in this paper, we present neural network architectures that predict a point in color space for a given color name. Proposed models provide user interface between colors and names by learning the language semantics and mimic human level comprehension of color descriptions to predict colors and modify them with respect to linguistic adjectives of color names. We consider color prediction as a regression problem and solve it as a language modeling task. Color descriptions are taken as text sequences and each sentence is represented with word-level tokenization. Each token is transformed into a word vector in the latent space using CBOW word embeddings model. Word vectors representing color names are fed as input to neural networks and trained with normalized R, G, B values as supervision information. Trained models are capable of predicting color for a given color name and modify colors for different nouns and adjectives associated with color names. We also built color generation models based on pre-trained word embeddings to overcome the limited availability of large linguistic color name datasets. These pre-trained models perform well with datasets containing few thousand color names. We then present two recommendation engines that suggest similar color palette to user given color name. These recommendation engines enhance the color vocabulary and assist users in the color selection process.

AB Leveraging the latest research results on hypermedia-driven Web APIs and the newest update of the OpenAPI Specification, we propose a reference ontology for REST services along with a formal procedure for converting OpenAPI service descriptions to instances of this ontology. At the heart of the approach is a model for enhancing the meaning of Schema properties (i.e. re-usable JSON Schema properties that clarify the meaning of service components). Schema properties are semantically annotated (i.e. their meaning is mapped to a semantic model) and existing properties are combined to form composed or polymorphic expressions. The algorithm for mapping service descriptions to the OpenAPI ontology is implemented and is available as a Web Application.

ID MODEL
AB Nickel-based superalloys are widely employed in aerospace due to their excellent high-temperature strength, good oxidation resistance, and hot corrosion resistance. Abrasive belt grinding can effectively solve the problems of excessive residual stress and tool wear during the processing of superalloys. However, due to the grinding process being complex and changeable, and a wide range of affecting factors, the surface roughness prediction of abrasive belt grinding has become a challenging topic. In this study, a CAN-Net multi-hidden layer deep learning prediction model is established. The concatenate path is utilized to fuse local weights to optimize the intermediate weights of network training. To increase the predictability of the model, the attention mechanism is included to distribute the weights of the grinding parameters, and the impact of the attention mechanism on the prediction is then carefully analyzed. The results demonstrate that the CAN-Net network model has outstanding parameter flexibility and prediction accuracy, with accuracy reaching 0.984 and a correlation coefficient of 0.981 between the anticipated value and the true value.

ID 3-WAY APPROXIMATIONS
AB As a three-way approximation scheme to deal with fuzzy set, shadowed set approximately divides fuzzy objects with uncertainty into elevated, reduced, and shadow areas by a pair of decision thresholds (alpha, 13), thus effectively reducing the uncertainty of information. However, the current construction of shadowed set is all based on a single principle, lacking the comprehensive consideration of multiple principles, and these construction principles focus on the rationality of semantic interpretation of model construction process and threshold determination, and lack of consideration of the validity of partition results. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a new shadowed set model through the game analysis between uncertainty and decision cost (UC-GTSS). First, Combining shadowed set construction with game theory, UC-GTSS is proposed based on game competition mechanism. Through the game analysis of uncertainty and decision cost, the optimal (alpha, 13) is found, and a game payoff fusion algorithm based on Topsis is proposed. Second, the definition of UC-GTSS model expression, game player, strategy, payoff function, equilibrium analysis, optimization (alpha, 13) determination and the influence of model parameters are analyzed and discussed. Third, the UC-GTSS model is extended and discussed based on the validity of the partition results, such as the game between approximate classification accuracy and coverage, the game between the Gini coefficient of the partition areas. Finally, through the analysis of algorithms, instances and data experiments, the construction process, validity, and rationality of UC-GTSS and its extended model are demonstrated.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Speech interfaces, such as personal assistants and screen readers, read image captions to users. Typically, however, only one caption is available per image, which may not be adequate for all situations (e.g., browsing large quantities of images). Long captions provide a deeper understanding of an image but require more time to listen to, whereas shorter captions may not allow for such thorough comprehension yet have the advantage of being faster to consume. We explore how to effectively collect both thumbnail captions-succinct image descriptions meant to be consumed quickly-and comprehensive captions-which allow individuals to understand visual content in greater detail. We consider text-based instructions and time-constrained methods to collect descriptions at these two levels of detail and find that a time-constrained method is the most effective for collecting thumbnail captions while preserving caption accuracy. Additionally, we verify that caption authors using this time-constrained method are still able to focus on the most important regions of an image by tracking their eye gaze. We evaluate our collected captions along human-rated axes-correctness, fluency, amount of detail, and mentions of important concepts-and discuss the potential for model-based metrics to perform large-scale automatic evaluations in the future.

AB User interfaces (UI) of desktop, web, and mobile applications involve a hierarchy of objects (e.g., applications, screens, view class, and other types of design objects) with multimodal (e.g., textual and visual) and positional (e.g., spatial location, sequence order, and hierarchy level) attributes. We can therefore represent a set of application UIs as a heterogeneous network with multimodal and positional attributes. Such a network not only represents how users understand the visual layout of UIs but also influences how users would interact with applications through these UIs. To model the UI semantics well for different UI annotation, search, and evaluation tasks, this article proposes the novel Heterogeneous Attention-based Multimodal Positional (HAMP) graph neural network model. HAMP combines graph neural networks with the scaled dot-product attention used in transformers to learn the embeddings of heterogeneous nodes and associated multimodal and positional attributes in a unified manner. HAMP is evaluated with classification and regression tasks conducted on three distinct real-world datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that HAMP significantly out-performs other state-of-the-art models on such tasks. To further provide interpretations of the contribution of heterogeneous network information for understanding the relationships between the UI structure and prediction tasks, we propose Adaptive HAMP (AHAMP), which adaptively learns the importance of different edges linking different UI objects. Our experiments demonstrate AHAMP's superior performance over HAMP on a number of tasks, and its ability to provide interpretations of the contribution of multimodal and positional attributes, as well as heterogeneous network information to different tasks.

AB Web data records are usually accompanied by auxiliary webpage segments, such as filters, sort options, search form, and multi-page links, to enhance interaction efficiency and convenience for end users. However, blind and visually impaired (BVI) persons are presently unable to fully exploit the auxiliary segments like their sighted peers, since these segments are scattered all across the screen, and as such assistive technologies used by BVI users, i.e., screen reader and screen magnifier, are not geared for efficient interaction with such scattered content. Specifically, for blind screen reader users, content navigation is predominantly one-dimensional despite the support for skipping content, and therefore navigating to-and-fro between different parts of the webpage is tedious and frustrating. Similarly, low vision screen magnifier users have to continuously pan back-and-forth between different portions of a webpage, given that only a portion of the screen is viewable at any instant due to content enlargement. The extant techniques to overcome inefficient web interaction for BVI users have mostly focused on general web-browsing activities, and as such they provide little to no support for data record-specific interaction activities such as filtering and sorting-activities that are equally important for facilitating quick and easy access to desired data records. To fill this void, we present InSupport, a browser extension that: (i) employs custom machine learning-based algorithms to automatically extract auxiliary segments on any webpage containing data records; and (ii) provides an instantly accessible proxy one-stop interface for easily navigating the extracted auxiliary segments using either basic keyboard shortcuts or mouse actions. Evaluation studies with 14 blind participants and 16 low vision participants showed significant improvement in web usability with InSupport, driven by an increased reduction in interaction time and user effort, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.

TI Conversational Context-sensitive Ad Generation with a Few Core-Queries

DE Dialogue; context; advertisement; query generation; mask prediction
AB When people are talking together in front of digital signage, advertisements that are aware of the context of the dialogue will work the most effectively. However, it has been challenging for computer systems to retrieve the appropriate advertisement from among the many options presented in large databases. Our proposed system, the Conversational Context-sensitive Advertisement generator (CoCoA), is the first attempt to apply masked word prediction to web information retrieval that takes into account the dialogue context. The novelty of CoCoA is that advertisers simply need to prepare a few abstract phrases, called Core-Queries, and then CoCoA automatically generates a context-sensitive expression as a complete search query by utilizing a masked word prediction technique that adds a word related to the dialogue context to one of the prepared Core-Queries. This automatic generation frees the advertisers from having to come up with context-sensitive phrases to attract users' attention. Another unique point is that the modified Core-Query offers users speaking in front of the CoCoA system a list of context-sensitive advertisements. CoCoA was evaluated by crowd workers regarding the context-sensitivity of the generated search queries against the dialogue text of multiple domains prepared in advance. The results indicated that CoCoA could present more contextual and practical advertisements than other web-retrieval systems. Moreover, CoCoA acquired a higher evaluation in a particular conversation that included many travel topics to which the Core-Queries were designated, implying that it succeeded in adapting the Core-Queries for the specific ongoing context better than the compared method without any effort on the part of the advertisers. In addition, case studies with users and advertisers revealed that the context-sensitive advertisements generated by CoCoA also had an effect on the content of the ongoing dialogue. Specifically, since pairs unfamiliar with each other more frequently referred to the advertisement CoCoA displayed, the advertisements had an effect on the topics about which the pairs spoke. Moreover, participants of an advertiser role recognized that some of the search queries generated by CoCoA fit the context of a conversation and that CoCoA improved the effect of the advertisement. In particular, they learned how to design of designing a good Core-Query at ease by observing the users' response to the advertisements retrieved with the generated search queries.

AB Microwave radars bring many benefits to mid-air gesture sensing due to their large field of view and independence from environmental conditions, such as ambient light and occlusion. However, radar signals are highly dimensional and usually require complex deep learning approaches. To understand this landscape, we report results from a systematic literature review of (N = 118) scientific papers on radar sensing, unveiling a large variety of radar technology of different operating frequencies and bandwidths and antenna configurations but also various gesture recognition techniques. Although highly accurate, these techniques require a large amount of training data that depend on the type of radar. Therefore, the training results cannot be easily transferred to other radars. To address this aspect, we introduce a new gesture recognition pipeline that implements advanced full-wave electromagnetic modeling and inversion to retrieve physical characteristics of gestures that are radar independent, i.e., independent of the source, antennas, and radar-hand interactions. Inversion of radar signals further reduces the size of the dataset by several orders of magnitude, while preserving the essential information. This approach is compatible with conventional gesture recognizers, such as those based on template matching, which only need a few training examples to deliver high recognition accuracy rates. To evaluate our gesture recognition pipeline, we conducted user-dependent and user-independent evaluations on a dataset of 16 gesture types collected with the Walabot, a low-cost off-the-shelf array radar. We contrast these results with those obtained for the same gesture types collected with an ultra-wideband radar made of a vector network analyzer with a single horn antenna and with a computer vision sensor, respectively. Based on our findings, we suggest some design implications to support future development in radar-based gesture recognition.

ID ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
AB While Human Activity Recognition systems may benefit from Active Learning by allowing users to self-annotate their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), many proposed methods for collecting such annotations are for short-term data collection campaigns for specific datasets. We present a reusable dialogue-based approach to user interaction for active learning in activity recognition systems, which utilises semantic similarity measures and a dataset of natural language descriptions of common activities (which we make publicly available). Our approach involves system-initiated dialogue, including follow-up questions to reduce ambiguity in user responses where appropriate. We apply this approach to two active learning scenarios: (i) using an existing CASAS dataset, demonstrating long-term usage; and (ii) using an online activity recognition system, which tackles the issue of online segmentation and labelling. We demonstrate our work in context, in which a natural language interface provides knowledge that can help interpret other multi-modal sensor data. We provide results highlighting the potential of our dialogue- and semantic similarity-based approach. We evaluate our work: (i) quantitatively, as an efficient way to seek users' input for active learning of ADLs; and (ii) qualitatively, through a user study in which users were asked to compare our approach and an established method. Results show the potential of our approach as a hands-free interface for annotation of sensor data as part of an active learning system. We provide insights into the challenges of active learning for activity recognition under real-world conditions and identify potential ways to address them.

AB Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g., along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when humans and fair AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer career recommendations without sacrificing its accuracy in prediction. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that perceived gender disparity is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. We conducted a follow-up survey to gain additional insights into the effectiveness of various design options that can help participants to overcome their own biases. Our results suggest that making fair AI explainable is crucial for increasing its adoption in the real world.

ID VIRTUAL AGENTS
AB Research has shown that free-form Game-Design (GD) environments can be very effective in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments.

AB With the increasing demand for online shopping and home delivery services, optimizing the routing of electric delivery vehicles in urban areas is crucial to reduce environmental pollution and improve operational efficiency. To address this opportunity, we optimize the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) for electric vehicles (EVs) in urban areas by combining city graphs with topographic and traffic information. The STSP is a variant of the traditional Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where it is not mandatory to visit all the nodes present in the graph. We train an artificial neural network (ANN) model to estimate electric consumption between nodes in the route using synthetic data generated with historical traffic simulation and topographical data. This allows us to generate smaller-weighted graphs that transform the problem from an STSP to a normal TSP where the 2-opt optimization algorithm is used to solve it with a Nearest Neighbor (NN) initialization. Compared to the approach of optimizing routes based on distance, our proposed algorithm offers a fast solution to the STSP for EVs (EV-STSP) with routes that consume 17.34% less energy for the test instances generated.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Currently, video and digital images possess extensive utility, ranging from recreational and social media purposes to verification, military operations, legal proceedings, and penalization. The enhancement mechanisms of this medium have undergone significant advancements, rendering them more accessible and widely available to a larger population. Consequently, this has facilitated the ease with which counterfeiters can manipulate images. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extraction and detection techniques were used to carry out this task, which aims to identify the variations in image features between modified and non-manipulated areas. However, the effectiveness of the existing detection methods could be more efficient. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a segmentation method to identify the forgery region in images with the U-Net model's improved structure. The suggested model connects the encoder and decoder pipeline by improving the convolution module and increasing the set of weights in the U-Net contraction and expansion path. In addition, the parameters of the U-Net network are optimized by using the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). Experiments were carried out on the publicly accessible image tempering detection evaluation dataset from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA) to assess the efficacy of the suggested strategy. The results show that the U-Net modifications significantly improve the overall segmentation results compared to other models. The effectiveness of this method was evaluated on CASIA, and the quantitative results obtained based on accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score demonstrate the superiority of the U-Net modifications over other models.

An AGR comprises both conversationality and universality to engage in natural dialogues and generate recommendations across various domains. We propose ten fundamental principles that an AGR should adhere to, each with its corresponding testing protocol. We proceed to assess whether ChatGPT, a sophisticated LLM, can comply with the proposed principles by engaging in recommendation-oriented dialogues with the model while observing its behavior. Our findings demonstrate the potential for ChatGPT to serve as an AGR, though several limitations and areas for improvement are identified.

AB It is difficult to identify histone modification from datasets that contain high-throughput sequencing data. Although multiple methods have been developed to identify histone modification, most of these methods are not specific to histone modification but are general methods that aim to identify protein binding to the genome. In this study, tensor decomposition (TD) and principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised feature extraction with optimized standard deviation were successfully applied to gene expression and DNA methylation. The proposed method was used to identify histone modification. Histone modification along the genome is binned within the region of length L. Considering principal components (PCs) or singular value vectors (SVVs) that PCA or TD attributes to samples, we can select PCs or SVVs attributed to regions. The selected PCs and SVVs further attribute p-values to regions, and adjusted p-values are used to select regions. The proposed method identified various histone modifications successfully and outperformed various state-of-the-art methods. This method is expected to serve as a de facto standard method to identify histone modification. For reproducibility and to ensure the systematic analysis of our study is applicable to datasets from different gene expression experiments, we have made our tools publicly available for download from gitHub.

AB Domain shifts in the training data are common in practical applications of machine learning; they occur for instance when the data is coming from different sources. Ideally, a ML model should work well independently of these shifts, for example, by learning a domain-invariant representation. However, common ML losses do not give strong guarantees on how consistently the ML model performs for different domains, in particular, whether the model performs well on a domain at the expense of its performance on another domain. In this paper, we build new theoretical foundations for this problem, by contributing a set of mathematical relations between classical losses for supervised ML and the Wasserstein distance in joint space (i.e. representation and output space). We show that classification or regression losses, when combined with a GAN-type discriminator between domains, form an upperbound to the true Wasserstein distance between domains. This implies a more invariant representation and also more stable prediction performance across domains. Theoretical results are corroborated empirically on several image datasets. Our proposed approach systematically produces the highest minimum classification accuracy across domains, and the most invariant representation. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID GAME
AB Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) has achieved many fascinating results in solving large-scale imperfect information games (IIGs). Neural network approximation CFR (neural CFR) is one of the promising techniques that can reduce computation and memory consumption by generalizing decision information between similar states. Current neural CFR algorithms have to approximate cumulative regrets. However, efficient and accurate approximation in a large-scale IIG is still a tough challenge. In this article, a new CFR variant, recursive CFR (ReCFR), is proposed. In ReCFR, recursive substitute values (RSVs) are learned and used to replace cumulative regrets. It is proven that ReCFR can converge to a Nash equilibrium at a rate of O(1/root T). Based on ReCFR, a new model-free neural CFR with bootstrap learning, neural ReCFR-B, is proposed. Due to the recursive and noncumulative nature of RSVs, neural ReCFR-B has lower variance training targets than other neural CFRs. Experimental results show that neural ReCFR-B is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural CFR algorithms at a much lower training cost.

AB Location-based games have become a worldwide phenomenon, but their multiplayer options typically are either superficial or force players to play together only locally. We introduce a system that compares game areas around the globe and matches points of interest onto each other, allowing for simultaneous gameplay across cities and countries. Thereby, we achieve game areas with an equal representation of their point of interest structure, allowing for fair and equal starting conditions. Our approach procedurally generates content for multiple players based on factors such as spatial relation and cultural relevance. Each generated game area can be adapted in size, orientation, and cultural location selection criteria to provide a level playing field for players with different mobility patterns or within areas with different sociocultural conditions. The content creation process utilizes publicly available OpenStreetMap data and achieves comparable results of high quality even in suburban or rural areas, where today's location-based games usually have a lower content density.

ID GAMES
AB Recent years have witnessed the great breakthrough of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in various artificial intelligence applications, but the training process needs a very large amount of samples and huge computational costs. To alleviate the low sample efficiency issue, one feasible solution is to improve the state representation learning. We uncover that the agents, trained by the original DRL algorithm, face severe performance degradation in mirrored game environments. As mirror symmetry is an important property of the environment, the poor performance in the mirrored situation indicates that the agents are not fully aware of the essence of the environment. In order to handle this problem and make use of the property to attain better state representation, we propose a mirror loss, which serves as an auxiliary module to bring mirror symmetry representation to the DRL agent. It is model-agnostic and prompts the DRL agent to make logically consistent mirrored actions in the mirrored environment. We conduct experiments on OpenAI Gym Atari environments and a more complex reinforcement learning task, Mahjong AI, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our method.

AB Who said that violent video games cannot promote calm behavior? Could we reverse engineer the difficulty system of a horror game to encourage the player to stay calm as opposed to feeling under constant pressure? To explore the feasibility of the approach and its effectiveness, we created a horror game, Caroline, which uses the player's biometric data to adapt the difficulty of the game: if the player is too stressed, the difficulty increases, and the opposite happens if the player is relaxed. We explored the effect of such an approach on players' cognitive, emotional, performative, and decision-making challenge as well as their intrinsic motivation by comparing it to the base game without any dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our results showed that players felt more motivated when the gameplay was adjusted according to their heart rate. However, out of the four types of challenge, the only one affected by the DDA was the decision-making challenge. We discuss what these findings mean for video game design and research into affective computing and provide suggestions for future research.

DE Experience management; Experience management; graph pruning; graph
   pruning; strong story mediation; strong story mediation
ID GENERATION
AB In interactive narratives, experience management is used to control the world and the nonplayer characters (NPCs) a player interacts with, encouraging particular types of stories or discouraging others. The space of all stories in a narrative can be understood as a story graph, with story states as nodes and actions in the story as directed edges. In this article, we present experience management as a graph pruning problem. Starting with the full story graph, edges representing NPC actions may be pruned until there is at most one action per NPC per state. With the full graph available, the choice of what to prune may consider all possible futures, and we can ensure that undesirable stories are not reachable. By never pruning player actions, we ensure the player may make any choice and still be accommodated in the story. When this method was used to manage the story of an adventure game, players found our technique generally produced higher agency and more-believable NPC behaviors than a control. Finally, we discuss scaling the results of this method for practical use.

ID GAME
AB Many attempts have been made to promote cooperation for multiagent systems. However, several issues that draw less attentions but may dramatically degrade the cooperation performance still exist, such as redundant information interactions among neighbors, and difficulties in understanding complex and dynamic environments from high-level cognition. To address these limitations, a cognition-driven multiagent policy (CDMAP) learning framework is proposed in this article. It includes a cognition difference network (CDN), a coupling cognition network (CCN), and a policy optimization network (PON). CDN is designed based on a variational autoencoder, where a concept of cognition difference is defined to prune redundant interactions among agents for more efficient communication. Based on the pruned topology, CCN captures the hidden representations of the surrounding environment. Several coupling graph attention layers are incorporated in CCN, each layer with different but coupling adjacent matrices, yielding a comprehensive state understanding from multiple representation spaces. Based on the captured hidden states, PON generates the final policies, where QMIX is adopted as a value factorization method to alleviate the credit-assignment problem. At last, CDMAP is evaluated through two representative multiagent games including Google Research Football and StarCraft II. The results demonstrate its superior effectiveness compared with existing methods.

AB While the serious game concept has considerably evolved in the last two decades, it still needs to be clearly differentiated from other types of artifacts. Thus, there is a degree of confusion about the relationship between serious games and other related applications, such as simulators or the repurposing of entertainment games within educational practices for most outside the domain. This article proposes a formal approach toward classifying games, toys, serious games, serious toys, serious repurposing and modding, and simulators. The aim of this theoretical work is twofold. First, on a practical level, this approach aims at helping actors from different ecosystems, such as health, to differentiate between these various devices and use them to their best advantage. Second, from a research perspective, based on a formal approach, our work aims to contribute to developing a taxonomy for gamified intervention with serious purposes. This formal approach demonstrates that unique combinations can be proposed to distinguish each kind of application. In this context, serious games can be seen as a specific purpose and not as a synonym for other existing applications.

AB Camouflage serves a dual purpose in games, imparting believability of the world and narrative and being a game asset used by players for customization. Using the U.S. Woodland Battle Dress Uniform or M81 as an inspiration for the pattern, we present a system for generating camouflage using a process based on present military evaluations. The proposed approach is a genetic algorithm that uses image processing/analysis techniques to assess the generated texture and can create camouflage that allows the soldier model to blend with the environment. A human evaluation was conducted and shows that the fitness metric used by the system is a suitable surrogate.

AB Today, there is a great variety of learning techniques and methodologies: traditional lectures, role-plays, group dynamics, project-based learning, simulations, educational games, and so on. Regarding technology-enhanced learning, the educational usage of virtual reality is innovative and the initiatives carried out suggest that this technology is an appealing medium for young people that facilitates an active and effective teaching. On the other hand, agile methodologies are widely spread across the IT industry and it is necessary to look for the best techniques to learn them in the most appropriate way. This contribution presents a virtual reality serious video game, named ScrumVR, which aims to teach the key aspects of the most widespread agile methodology for software development: Scrum. To do so, this video game tries to gets players closer to their first weeks of work within a Scrum team. The empirical results, gathered through a case study conducted with 78 software engineering students and supported by instruments, such as prepost tests and questionnaires, indicate that ScrumVR facilitates the learning of the roles, meetings, artifacts, and practices employed in Scrum, and contributes to enhance student's motivation and the whole learning experience.

DE Behavioral analysis; free-to-play video games; key performance
   indicators; mobile gaming
AB With mobile gaming becoming ever more popular, it is necessary to understand various aspects of player behavior in those games. This is especially true for free-to-play games as revenue comes from a small subset of the playerbase. This article presents a large-scale analysis of data collected over 9 months, comprising over 10 million players of a case study free-to-play mobile interactive story telling video game. The data are analyzed from a temporal standpoint, followed by presentation of findings in three important player engagement aspects: 1) retention; 2) conversion (i.e., players becoming payers); 3) lifetime revenue collected. These findings confirm the importance of early conversion in casual mobile games as the retention is low due to wide target audience. Additionally, players who convert very early also tend to spend more in the game in general. Most of the monetization depends on a small fraction of large spenders as one fifth of the entire revenue comes from only 2% of spenders. The article stresses out the key checkpoints in casual gameplay that are potentially most profitable topics for further research and player targeted actions. The insights of long-term analysis are relevant to both academia and industry in the efforts to optimize service quality, players' satisfaction, and profitability.

AB This article presents a framework for learning player embeddings in competitive games and events. Players and their win-loss relationships are modeled as a skill gap graph, which is an undirected weighted graph. The player embeddings are learned from the graph using a random walk-based graph embedding method and can reflect the relative skill levels among players. Embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations that can be conveniently applied to subsequent tasks while still preserving the topological relationships in a graph. In the latter part of this article, graphical Elo (GElo) is introduced as an application of player embeddings when rating player skills. GElo is an extension of the classic Elo rating system. It constructs a skill gap graph based on player match histories and learns player embeddings from it. Afterward, the rating scores that were calculated by Elo are adjusted according to player activeness and cosine similarities among player embeddings. GElo can be executed offline and in parallel, and it is nonintrusive to existing rating systems. Experiments on public datasets show that GElo makes a more reliable evaluation of player skill levels than vanilla Elo. The experimental results suggest potential applications of player embeddings in competitive games and events.

AB In this article, we present an approach to generate a team of general video game playing agents with differentiated behaviors that can ultimately assist in the game development process. We consider the agent behavior as the corresponding outcomes of playing the game: rate of wins, score, exploration, enemies killed, items collected, etc. We create and identify agents that are expected to achieve particular goals but do not necessarily simulate human behavior during gameplay. We present a solution that, by heuristic diversification, provides a controller with different heuristics and a corresponding set of weights, driving its actions. Given the simplicity of this behavior-encoding and its easiness to evolve, we use Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites to generate different solutions that elicit particular behaviors and assemble a team. The resulting agents are allocated in a feature space, used to identify the expectations of each of them. We generate a team for four games of the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence framework and find six different behavior-type agents in each. We include an experiment to check the portability of these agents when playing alternative levels and an exploratory work aiming to use them to detect design flaws in game levels.

AB Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in diverse scenarios, complex gambling games still pose great challenges for RL. Common deep RL methods have difficulties maintaining stability and efficiency in such games. By theoretical analysis, we find that the return distribution of a gambling game is an intrinsic factor of this problem. Such return distribution of gambling games is partitioned into two parts, depending on the win/lose outcome. These two parts represent the gain and loss. They repel each other because the player keeps "raising," i.e., making a wager. However, common deep RL methods directly approximate the expectation of the return, without considering the particularity of the distribution. This way causes a redundant loss term in the objective function and a subsequent high variance. In this work, we propose WagerWin, a new framework for gambling games. WagerWin introduces probability and value factorization to construct a more effective value function. Our framework removes the redundant loss term of the objective function in training. In addition, WagerWin supports customized policy adaptation, which can tune the pretrained policy for different inclinations. We conduct extensive experiments on DouDizhu and SmallDou, a reduced version of DouDizhu. The results demonstrate that WagerWin outperforms the original state-of-the-art RL model in both training efficiency and stability.

AB This retrospective study presents and summarizes our long-term efforts in the popularization of robotics, engineering, and artificial intelligence (STEM) using the NAO humanoid robot. By a conservative estimate, over a span of 8 years, we engaged at least a couple of thousand participants: approximately 70% were preschool children, 15% were elementary school students, and 15% were teenagers and adults. We describe several robot applications that were developed specifically for this task and assess their qualitative performance outside a controlled research setting, catering to various demographics, including those with special needs (ASD, ADHD). Five groups of applications are presented: (1) motor development activities and games, (2) children's games, (3) theatrical performances, (4) artificial intelligence applications, and (5) data harvesting applications. Different cases of human-robot interactions are considered and evaluated according to our experience, and we discuss their weak points and potential improvements. We examine the response of the audience when confronted with a humanoid robot featuring intelligent behavior, such as conversational intelligence and emotion recognition. We consider the importance of the robot's physical appearance, the emotional dynamics of human-robot engagement across age groups, the relevance of non-verbal cues, and analyze drawings crafted by preschool children both before and after their interaction with the NAO robot.

AB In this paper, the fixed-time synchronization control for neural networks with discontinuous data communication is investigated. Due to the transmission blocking caused by DoS attack, it is intractable to establish a monotonically decreasing Lyapunov function like the conventional analysis of fixed-time stability. Therefore, by virtue of recursive and reduction to absurdity approaches, novel fixed-time stability criteria where the estimated upper bound of settling-time is inherently different from existing results are presented. Then, based on the developed conditions, an event-triggered control scheme that can avoid Zeno behavior is designed to achieve synchronization of master-slave neural networks under DoS attack within a prescribed time. For comparison, the established control scheme is further discussed under the case without DoS attack, and the circumstance that there is no attack or event-triggered mechanism, respectively. Simulation results are finally provided to illustrate the significant and validity of our theoretical research. Especially, in terms of encryption and decryption keys generated from the synchronization behavior of chaotic networks, we specifically discuss the application of the proposed fixed-time synchronization scheme to image and audio encryption.

AB In this research, we present an algorithm that leverages language-transformer technologies to automate the generation of product requirements, utilizing E-Shop consumer reviews as a data source. Our methodology combines classical natural language processing techniques with diverse functions derived from transformer concepts, including keyword and summary generation. To effectively capture the most critical requirements, we employ the opportunity matrix as a robust mechanism for identifying and prioritizing urgent needs. Utilizing transformer technologies, mainly through the implementation of summarization and sentiment analysis, we can extract fundamental requirements from consumer assessments. As a practical demonstration, we apply our technology to analyze the ratings of the Amazon echo dot, showcasing our algorithm's superiority over conventional approaches by extracting human-readable problem descriptions to identify critical user needs. The results of our study exemplify the potential of transformer-enhanced opportunity mining in advancing the requirements-elicitation processes. Our approach streamlines product improvement by extracting human-readable problem descriptions from E-Shop consumer reviews, augmenting operational efficiency, and facilitating decision-making. These findings underscore the transformative impact of incorporating transformer technologies within requirements engineering, paving the way for more effective and scalable algorithms to elicit and address user needs.

AB Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a light-based imaging modality that is used widely in the diagnosis and management of eye disease, and it is starting to become used to evaluate for ear disease. However, manual image analysis to interpret the anatomical and pathological findings in the images it provides is complicated and time-consuming. To streamline data analysis and image processing, we applied a machine learning algorithm to identify and segment the key anatomical structure of interest for medical diagnostics, the tympanic membrane. Using 3D volumes of the human tympanic membrane, we used thresholding and contour finding to locate a series of objects. We then applied TensorFlow deep learning algorithms to identify the tympanic membrane within the objects using a convolutional neural network. Finally, we reconstructed the 3D volume to selectively display the tympanic membrane. The algorithm was able to correctly identify the tympanic membrane properly with an accuracy of similar to 98% while removing most of the artifacts within the images, caused by reflections and signal saturations. Thus, the algorithm significantly improved visualization of the tympanic membrane, which was our primary objective. Machine learning approaches, such as this one, will be critical to allowing OCT medical imaging to become a convenient and viable diagnostic tool within the field of otolaryngology.

AB The study of human behaviors aims to gain a deeper perception of stimuli that control decision making. To describe, explain, predict, and control behavior, human behavior can be classified as either non-aggressive or anomalous behavior. Anomalous behavior is any unusual activity; impulsive aggressive, or violent behaviors are the most harmful. The detection of such behaviors at the initial spark is critical for guiding public safety decisions and a key to its security. This paper proposes an automatic aggressive-event recognition method based on effective feature representation and analysis. The proposed approach depends on a spatiotemporal discriminative feature that combines histograms of oriented gradients and dense optical flow features. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) techniques are used for complexity reduction. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed on three datasets: Hockey-Fight (HF), Stony Brook University (SBU)-Kinect, and Movie-Fight (MF), with accuracy rates of 96.5%, 97.8%, and 99.6%, respectively. Also, this paper assesses and contrasts the feature engineering and learned features for impulsive aggressive event recognition. Experiments show promising results of the proposed method compared to the state of the art. The implementation of the proposed work is available here.

AB The heat transition is a central pillar of the energy transition, aiming to decarbonize and improve the energy efficiency of the heat supply in both the private and industrial sectors. On the one hand, this is achieved by substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy. On the other hand, it involves reducing overall heat consumption and associated transmission and ventilation losses. In addition to refurbishment, digitalization contributes significantly. Despite substantial research on Digital Twins (DTs) for heat transition at different scales, a cross-scale perspective on heat optimization still needs to be developed. In response to this research gap, the present study examines four instances of applied DTs across various scales: building, campus, neighborhood, and urban. The study compares their objectives and conceptual frameworks while also identifying common challenges and potential synergies. The study's findings indicate that all DT scales face similar data-related challenges, such as gathering, ownership, connectivity, and reliability. Also, hierarchical synergy is identified among the DTs, implying the need for collaboration and exchange. In response to this, the "Warmewende" data platform, whose objectives and concepts are presented in the paper, promotes research data and knowledge exchange with internal and external stakeholders.

AB This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach to enriching the museum experience using ChatGPT4, a state-of-the-art language model by OpenAI. By developing a museum guide powered by ChatGPT4, we aimed to address the challenges visitors face in navigating vast collections of artifacts and interpreting their significance. Leveraging the model's natural-language-understanding and -generation capabilities, our guide offers personalized, informative, and engaging experiences. However, caution must be exercised as the generated information may lack scientific integrity and accuracy. To mitigate this, we propose incorporating human oversight and validation mechanisms. The subsequent sections present our own case study, detailing the design, architecture, and experimental evaluation of the museum guide system, highlighting its practical implementation and insights into the benefits and limitations of employing ChatGPT4 in the cultural heritage context.

AB This paper investigated the importance of explainability in artificial intelligence models and its application in the context of prediction in Formula (1). A step-by-step analysis was carried out, including collecting and preparing data from previous races, training an AI model to make predictions, and applying explainability techniques in the said model. Two approaches were used: the attention technique, which allowed visualizing the most relevant parts of the input data using heat maps, and the permutation importance technique, which evaluated the relative importance of features. The results revealed that feature length and qualifying performance are crucial variables for position predictions in Formula (1). These findings highlight the relevance of explainability in AI models, not only in Formula (1) but also in other fields and sectors, by ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-based decision making. The results highlight the importance of considering explainability in AI models and provide a practical methodology for its implementation in Formula (1) and other domains.

DT Article
DE Generalized zero-shot learning; Generative adversarial networks; Data
   distribution; Information asymmetric problem
AB Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to generalize a pretrained classification model to unseen classes with the help of auxiliary semantic information. Recent generative methods are based on the paradigm of synthesizing unseen visual data from class attributes. A mapping is learnt from semantic attributes to visual features extracted by a pre-trained backbone such as ResNet101 by training a generative adversarial network. Considering the domain-shift problem between pre-trained backbone and task ZSL dataset as well as the information asymmetry problem between images and attributes, this manuscript suggests that the visual-semantic balance should be learnt separately from the ZSL models. In particular, we propose a plug-and-play Attribute Representation Transformation (ART) framework to pre-process visual features with a contrastive regression module and an attribute place-holder module. Our contrastive regression loss is a tailored design for visual-attribute transformation, which gains favorable properties from both classification and regression losses. As for the attribute place-holder module, an end-to-end mapping loss function is introduced to build the relationship between transformed features and semantic attributes. Experiments conducted on five popular benchmarks manifest that the proposed ART framework can significantly benefit existing generative models in both ZSL and generalized ZSL settings.

ID SIMULATING GEAR; NETWORK; MODEL
AB In recent years, deep learning has been extensively applied to bearing fault diagnosis with remarkable achievements. However, in real industrial scenarios, the primary challenge in developing an effective intelligent diagnosis model is the scarcity of fault samples required for training due to shutting down operations during failure behavior. Simulation data-driven and data augmentation-based small sample diagnosis methods have their own limitations, including insufficient diagnostic performance and low data quality. In view of these, a novel mechanism-data fusion diagnosis scheme with bearing dynamic model and multi-agent diverse generative adversarial network (MAD-GAN) is proposed in this study. Specifically, the bearing dynamic model addresses the scarcity of failure samples by simulating vibration signals across various operating conditions. Besides, A simulation-real transformation model based on MAD-GAN is developed to achieve the conversion between simulated domain and real domain, which shares the diagnostic knowledge between two domains. Finally, the domain adversarial based comprehensive generalization network is improved by maximum mean discrepancy and metric learning to further generalize diagnosis knowledge from simulation domain to real domain. Two bearing experimental datasets are applicated and case studies are conducted under small sample, validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results show the potential application of this method in real industrial scenarios.

ID OCEAN FRONTS
AB Oceanic eddies and fronts are plentiful in the global oceans. There are abundant frontal processes at the edges of eddies, meanwhile, eddies can be formed due to instability along the fronts. Moreover, they can both induce submesoscale processes and strong vertical motions. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the correlation between eddies and fronts, along with their spatiotemporal distribution characteristics, for the transport of ocean energy and material and marine ecosystems. Generally, using remote sensing to detect eddies and fronts is based on geometrics, physical parameters, and handcrafted features. Existing approaches are inaccurate due to the highly dynamic nature of eddies and fronts as well as the lack of physical mechanisms between them. This paper proposes an adversarial approach for mining eddy-front coupling, dubbed the eddy-front generative adversarial network (EFGAN). In EFGAN, the generator follows the encoder-decoder structure and consists of a data encoder, a feature decoder, and a multi-task generation module. The rich contextual and semantic information on eddy features and frontal structure, which are the physical constraints for EFGAN, can be extracted from the fusion of satellite sea level anomaly (SLA) and sea surface temperature (SST) data, generating styled eddy-front coupling images with the accompaniment of the mask of eddy-front categories and styled fronts. To tackle the issue of inconsistency in the category of a single eddy, an instance consistency loss is designed to make the category of each individual eddy as consistent as possible, thus ensuring that the correlation of eddy-front belongs to a single category. Furthermore, multiple loss functions are combined to jointly guide network training to improve stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFGAN outperforms state-of-the-art generative adversarial network-based models. The spatial distribution indicates that frontal eddies are more prevalent at the confluence where warm and cold currents meet. In the Kuroshio Extension region, there are concentrated distribution areas of frontal eddies that are strong in the boreal spring and summer, while eddy-induced fronts are highly active in the boreal winter and spring but weak in autumn.

DT Article
DE Graph neural networks; Drug response prediction; Multi -view graph;
   Attention mechanism
AB Precision medicine is devoted to discovering personalized therapy for complex and difficult diseases like cancer. Many machine learning approaches have been developed for drug response prediction towards precision medicine. Notwithstanding, genetic profiles based multi-view graph learning schemes have not yet been explored for drug response prediction in previous works. Furthermore, multi-scale latent feature fusion is not considered sufficiently in the existing frameworks of graph neural networks (GNNs). Previous works on drug response prediction mainly depend on sequence data or single-view graph data. In this paper, we propose to construct multi-view graph by means of multi-omics data and STRING protein-protein association data, and develop a new architecture of GNNs for drug response prediction in cancer. Specifically, we propose hybrid multi-view and multi-scale graph duplex-attention networks (HMM-GDAN), in which both multi-view self-attention mechanism and view-level attention mechanism are devised to capture the complementary information of views and emphasize on the importance of each view collaboratively, and rich multi-scale features are constructed and integrated to further form high-level representations for better prediction. Experiments on GDSC2 dataset verify the superiority of the proposed HMM-GDAN when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The effectiveness of multi-view and multi-scale strategies is demonstrated by the ablation study.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent advancements in 3D Human Pose Estimation using fully-supervised learning approach have shown impressive results; however, these methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated 3D data, which are challenging to obtain outside controlled laboratory environments. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new self-supervised training method designed to train a 3D human pose estimation network using unlabeled multi-view images. The model trains relative depths between joints without any 3D annotation by satisfying multi-view consistency constraints from unlabeled multi-view videos without camera calibration, while simultaneously learning representations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. For this reason, we call our proposed network a Multi-Hypothesis Canonical Lifting Network (MHCanonNet). By enriching the diversity of extracted features and keeping various possibilities open, our network accurately estimates the final 3D pose. The key idea lies in the design of a novel and unbiased reconstruction objective function that combines multiple hypotheses from different viewpoints. The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art results not only on two popular benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP but also on an in-the-wild dataset, Ski-Pose, surpassing existing self-supervised training methods.

AB The pre-operative localisation of abnormal parathyroid glands (PG) in parathyroid scintigraphy is essential for suggesting treatment and assisting surgery. Human experts examine the scintigraphic image outputs. An assisting diagnostic framework for localisation reduces the workload of physicians and can serve educational purposes. Former studies from the authors suggested a successful deep learning model, but it produced many false positives. Between 2010 and 2020, 648 participants were enrolled in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece. An innovative modification of the well-known VGG19 network (ParaNet+) is proposed to classify scintigraphic images into normal and abnormal classes. The Grad-CAM++ algorithm is applied to localise the abnormal PGs. An external dataset of 100 patients imaged at the same department who underwent parathyroidectomy in 2021 and 2022 was used for evaluation. ParaNet+ agreed with the human readers, showing 0.9861 on a patient-level and 0.8831 on a PG-level basis under a 10-fold cross-validation on the training set of 648 participants. Regarding the external dataset, the experts identified 93 of 100 abnormal patient cases and 99 of 118 surgically excised abnormal PGs. The human-reader false-positive rate (FPR) was 10% on a PG basis. ParaNet+ identified 99/100 abnormal cases and 103/118 PGs, with an 11.2% FPR. The model achieved higher sensitivity on both patient and PG bases than the human reader (99.0% vs. 93% and 87.3% vs. 83.9%, respectively), with comparable FPRs. Deep learning can assist in detecting and localising abnormal PGs in scintigraphic scans of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and can be adapted to the everyday routine.

AB Efforts across diverse domains like economics, energy, and agronomy have focused on developing predictive models for time series data. A spectrum of techniques, spanning from elementary linear models to intricate neural networks and machine learning algorithms, has been explored to achieve accurate forecasts. The hybrid ARIMA-SVR model has garnered attention due to its fusion of a foundational linear model with error correction capabilities. However, its use is limited to stationary time series data, posing a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations and drive progress, we propose the innovative NAR-SVR hybrid method. Unlike its predecessor, this approach breaks free from stationarity and linearity constraints, leading to improved model performance solely through historical data exploitation. This advancement significantly reduces the time and computational resources needed for precise predictions, a critical factor in univariate economic time series forecasting. We apply the NAR-SVR hybrid model in three scenarios: Spanish berry daily yield data from 2018 to 2021, daily COVID-19 cases in three countries during 2020, and the daily Bitcoin price time series from 2015 to 2020. Through extensive comparative analyses with other time series prediction models, our results substantiate that our novel approach consistently outperforms its counterparts. By transcending stationarity and linearity limitations, our hybrid methodology establishes a new paradigm for univariate time series forecasting, revolutionizing the field and enhancing predictive capabilities across various domains as highlighted in this study.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Planning an achievable trajectory for a mobile robot usually consists of two steps: (i) finding a path in the form of a sequence of discrete waypoints and (ii) transforming this sequence into a continuous and smooth curve. To solve the second problem, this paper proposes algorithms for automatic dynamic smoothing of the primary path using a tracking differentiator with sigmoid corrective actions. Algorithms for setting the gains of the differentiator are developed, considering a set of design constraints on velocity, acceleration, and jerk for various mobile robots. When tracking a non-smooth primary path, the output variables of the differentiator generate smooth trajectories implemented by a mechanical plant. It is shown that the tracking differentiator with a different number of blocks also generates derivatives of the smoothed trajectory of any required order, taking into account the given constraints. Unlike standard analytical methods of polynomial smoothing, the proposed algorithm has a low computational load. It is easily implemented in real time on the on-board computer. In addition, simple methods for modeling a safety corridor are proposed, taking into account the dimensions of the vehicle when planning a polygon with stationary obstacles. Confirming results of numerical simulation of the developed algorithms are presented.

AB With the function RooTri(), we present a simple and robust calculation method for the approximation of the intersection points of a scalar field given as an unstructured point cloud with a plane oriented arbitrarily in space. The point cloud is approximated to a surface consisting of triangles whose edges are used for computing the intersection points. The function contourc() of Matlab is taken as a reference. Our experiments show that the function contourc() produces outliers that deviate significantly from the defined nominal value, while the quality of the results produced by the function RooTri() increases with finer resolution of the examined grid.

AB Deep learning has enabled a straightforward, convenient method of road pavement infrastructure management that facilitates a secure, cost-effective, and efficient transportation network. Manual road pavement inspection is time-consuming and dangerous, making timely road repair difficult. This research showcases You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5), the most commonly employed object detection model trained on the latest benchmark Road Damage Dataset, Road Damage Detection 2022 (RDD 2022). The RDD 2022 dataset includes four common types of road pavement damage, namely vertical cracks, horizontal cracks, alligator cracks, and potholes. This paper presents an improved deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 for real-time road pavement damage detection in photographic representations of outdoor road surfaces, making it an indispensable tool for efficient, real-time, and cost-effective road infrastructure management. The YOLOv5 model has been modified to incorporate several techniques that improve its accuracy and generalization performance. These techniques include the Efficient Channel Attention module (ECA-Net), label smoothing, the K-means(++ )algorithm, Focal Loss, and an additional prediction layer. In addition, a 1.9% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and a 1.29% increase in F1-Score were attained by the model in comparison to YOLOv5s, with an increment of 1.1 million parameters. Moreover, a 0.11% improvement in mAP and 0.05% improvement in F1 score was achieved by the proposed model compared to YOLOv8s while having 3 million fewer parameters and 12 gigabytes fewer Giga Floating Point Operation per Second (GFlops).

SO BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE speech emotion recognition; functional data; MFCC
AB Speech Emotions Recognition (SER) has gained significant attention in the fields of human-computer interaction and speech processing. In this article, we present a novel approach to improve SER performance by interpreting the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as a multivariate functional data object, which accelerates learning while maintaining high accuracy. To treat MFCCs as functional data, we preprocess them as images and apply resizing techniques. By representing MFCCs as functional data, we leverage the temporal dynamics of speech, capturing essential emotional cues more effectively. Consequently, this enhancement significantly contributes to the learning process of SER methods without compromising performance. Subsequently, we employ a supervised learning model, specifically a functional Support Vector Machine (SVM), directly on the MFCC represented as functional data. This enables the utilization of the full functional information, allowing for more accurate emotion recognition. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two distinct databases, EMO-DB and IEMOCAP, serving as benchmarks for SER evaluation. Our method demonstrates competitive results in terms of accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in emotion recognition. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces the learning time, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world applications. In conclusion, our novel approach of treating MFCCs as multivariate functional data objects exhibits superior performance in SER tasks, delivering both improved accuracy and substantial time savings during the learning process. This advancement holds great potential for enhancing human-computer interaction and enabling more sophisticated emotion-aware applications.

AB Humans are considered to be communicative, usually interacting in dyads or groups. In this paper, we investigate group interactions regarding performance in a rather formal gathering. In particular, a collection of ten performance indicators used in social group sciences is used to assess the outcomes of the meetings in this manuscript, in an automatic, machine learning-based way. For this, the Parking Lot Corpus, comprising 70 meetings in total, is analysed. At first, we obtain baseline results for the automatic prediction of performance results on the corpus. This is the first time the Parking Lot Corpus is tapped in this sense. Additionally, we compare baseline values to those obtained, utilising bidirectional long-short term memories. For multiple performance indicators, improvements in the baseline results are able to be achieved. Furthermore, the experiments showed a trend that the acoustic material of the remaining group should use for the prediction of team performance.

AB The fast growth of data in the academic field has contributed to making recommendation systems for scientific papers more popular. Content-based filtering (CBF), a pivotal technique in recommender systems (RS), holds particular significance in the realm of scientific publication recommendations. In a content-based scientific publication RS, recommendations are composed by observing the features of users and papers. Content-based recommendation encompasses three primary steps, namely, item representation, user modeling, and recommendation generation. A crucial part of generating recommendations is the user modeling process. Nevertheless, this step is often neglected in existing content-based scientific publication RS. Moreover, most existing approaches do not capture the semantics of user models and papers. To address these limitations, in this paper we present a transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA), a content-based scientific publication RS that implicitly derives user interest models from their authored papers. To address the semantic issues, RIMA combines word embedding-based keyphrase extraction techniques with knowledge bases to generate semantically-enriched user interest models, and additionally leverages pretrained transformer sentence encoders to represent user models and papers and compute their similarities. The effectiveness of our approach was assessed through an offline evaluation by conducting extensive experiments on various datasets along with user study (N = 22), demonstrating that (a) combining SIFRank and SqueezeBERT as an embedding-based keyphrase extraction method with DBpedia as a knowledge base improved the quality of the user interest modeling step, and (b) using the msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b sentence transformer model achieved better results in the recommendation generation step.

ID OPTIMAL PLACEMENT; OPTIMAL LOCATION; POWER QUALITY; OPTIMIZATION
AB This research addresses the efficient integration and sizing of flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) in electrical distribution networks via a convex optimization approach. The exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model associated with FACTS siting and sizing aims for the minimization of the expected annual operating costs of the network (i.e., energy losses and FACTS purchasing costs). The constraints of this problem include power equilibrium equalities, voltage regulation bounds, and device capacities, among others. Due to the power equilibrium constraints per node and period, the MINLP model is a non-convex optimization problem. To transform the exact MINLP model into a mixed-integer convex one, the approximation of the product between two variables in the complex domain is relaxed through its hyperbolic equivalent, which generates a set of convex cones. The main advantage of the proposed mixed-integer convex model is that it ensures the global optimum of the problem, even when considering objective multiplexes. Numerical simulations in the IEEE 33-, 69-, and 85-bus grids demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FACTS integration via the proposed convex approach in comparison with the exact solution of the MINLP model in the GAMS software as well as with combinatorial optimization algorithms (i.e., the black widow optimizer and the vortex search algorithm). All simulations were carried out in MATLAB with Yalmip optimization and the Gurobi and Mosek solvers. The simulation results show that, for a fixed operation of the FACTS devices (i.e., a VAR compensator) during the day, the annual operating costs are reduced by 12.63%, 13.97%, and 26.53% for the IEEE 33-, 69-, and 85-bus test systems, respectively, while for the operation variable, the reductions are by 14.24%, 15.79%, and 30.31%, respectively.

AB Enormous amounts of data collected from social networks or other online platforms are being published for the sake of statistics, marketing, and research, among other objectives. The consequent privacy and data security concerns have motivated the work on degree-based data anonymization. In this paper, we propose and study a new multi-objective anonymization approach that generalizes the known degree anonymization problem and attempts at improving it as a more realistic model for data security/privacy. Our suggested model guarantees a convenient privacy level, based on modifying the degrees in a way that respects some given local restrictions, per node, such that the total modifications at the global level (in the whole graph/network) are bounded by some given value. The corresponding multi-objective graph realization approach is formulated and solved using Integer Linear Programming to obtain an optimum solution. Our thorough experimental studies provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the new approach, by specifically showing that the introduced anonymization algorithm has a negligible effect on the way nodes are clustered, thereby preserving valuable network information while significantly improving data privacy.

AB As the largest open social medium on the Internet, Reddit is widely studied in the scientific literature. Due to its structured form and division into topical subfora (subreddits), conducted research often concerns connections and interactions between users and/or whole, subreddit-structure-based communities. Overall, the relations between communities are most often studied by applying graph networks, with various creation algorithms. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to build and understand the structure of Reddit. It is based on crossposts-posts that appeared on one subreddit and then were crossposted to another. After capturing one year of crossposts, a directed weighted graph network, using seven million posts from over 10,000 of the most popular subreddits, has been created. Using graph network algorithms, its characteristics are captured and compared to similar studies. We identify the information "sinks" and "sources"-the most active crossposting subreddits. Moreover, we obtained graph network metrics: the degree (modeled with the Power Law), clustering, community detection algorithms, and connected components structure network are compared to previous studies on Reddit network(s), yielding consistent, but also novel results. Finally, the relations between extensively studied subreddits (e.g., r/AITA, r/Parenting, r/politics) and new ones, which were not accounted for in previous research, opening new paths for data-driven studies, are summarized.

AB In the last decades, the availability constraint as well as learning and deteriorating effects were introduced into the production scheduling theory to simulate real-world case studies and to overcome the limitation of the classical models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in the literature to address the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) with flexible maintenance under learning and deterioration effects to minimize the makespan. Firstly, we address the PFSP with flexible maintenance and learning effects. Then, the deteriorating effect is also considered. Adaptive artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC) enhanced with Q-learning are proposed, in which the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic and modified NEH heuristics are hybridized with a maintenance insertion heuristic to construct potential integrated initial solutions. Furthermore, a Q-learning (QL)-based neighborhood selection is applied in the employed bees phase to improve the quality of the search space solutions. Computational experiments performed on Taillard's well-known benchmarks, augmented with both prognostic and health management (PHM) and maintenance data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QL-driven ABC algorithms.

AB While there are several ways to identify customer behaviors, few extract this value from information already in a database, much less extract relevant characteristics. This paper presents the development of a prototype using the recency, frequency, and monetary attributes for customer segmentation of a retail database. For this purpose, the standard K-means, K-medoids, and MiniBatch K-means were evaluated. The standard K-means clustering algorithm was more appropriate for data clustering than other algorithms as it remained stable until solutions with six clusters. The evaluation of the clusters' quality was obtained through the internal validation indexes Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin. When consensus was not obtained, three external validation indexes were applied: global stability, stability per cluster, and segment-level stability across solutions. Six customer segments were obtained, identified by their unique behavior: lost customers, disinterested customers, recent customers, less recent customers, loyal customers, and best customers. Their behavior was evidenced and analyzed, indicating trends and preferences. The proposed method combining recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM), K-means clustering, internal indices, and external indices achieved return rates of 17.50%, indicating acceptable selectivity of the customers.

   Detection Using Diffusion-Based Data Augmentation
SO ALGORITHMS

DE anomalous sound detection; masked autoencoders; Contrastive learning;
   Variance-Covariance Regularization; diffusion-based data augmentation
AB Unsupervised anomalous sound detection, especially self-supervised methods, plays a crucial role in differentiating unknown abnormal sounds of machines from normal sounds. Self-supervised learning can be divided into two main categories: Generative and Contrastive methods. While Generative methods mainly focus on reconstructing data, Contrastive learning methods refine data representations by leveraging the contrast between each sample and its augmented version. However, existing Contrastive learning methods for anomalous sound detection often have two main problems. The first one is that they mostly rely on simple augmentation techniques, such as time or frequency masking, which may introduce biases due to the limited diversity of real-world sounds and noises encountered in practical scenarios (e.g., factory noises combined with machine sounds). The second issue is dimension collapsing, which leads to learning a feature space with limited representation. To address the first shortcoming, we suggest a diffusion-based data augmentation method that employs ChatGPT and AudioLDM. Also, to address the second concern, we put forward a two-stage self-supervised model. In the first stage, we introduce a novel approach that combines Contrastive learning and masked autoencoders to pre-train on the MIMII and ToyADMOS2 datasets. This combination allows our model to capture both global and local features, leading to a more comprehensive representation of the data. In the second stage, we refine the audio representations for each machine ID by employing supervised Contrastive learning to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This process enhances the relationship between audio features originating from the same machine ID. Experiments show that our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Our suggested model achieves an average AUC and pAUC of 94.39% and 87.93% on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 dataset, respectively.

AB Modern pig farming leaves much to be desired in terms of efficiency, as these systems rely mainly on electrome-chanical controls and can only categorize pigs according to their weight. This method is not only inefficient but also escalates labor expenses and heightens the threat of zoonotic diseases. Furthermore, confining pigs in large groups can exacerbate the spread of infections and complicate the monitoring and care of ill pigs. This re-search executed an experiment to construct a deep-learning sorting mechanism, leveraging a dataset infused with pivotal metrics and breeding imagery gathered over 24 months. This research integrated a Kalman filter-based algorithm to augment the precision of the dynamic sorting operation. This research experiment unveiled a pioneering machine vision sorting system powered by deep learning, adept at handling live imagery for multi-faceted recognition objectives. The Individual recognition model based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) monitors livestock weight for sustained data forecasting, whereas the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGAN) image enhancement algorithm bolsters recognition in distinct settings, fortifying the model's resilience. Notably, system can pinpoint livestock exhibiting signs of potential illness via irregular body appearances and isolate them for safety. Experimental outcomes validate the superiority of this proposed system over traditional counterparts. It not only minimizes manual interventions and data upkeep expenses but also heightens the accu-racy of livestock identification and optimizes data usage. This findings reflect an 89% success rate in livestock ID recognition, a 32% surge in obscured image recognition, a 95% leap in livestock categorization accuracy, and a re-markable 98% success rate in discerning images of unwell pigs. In essence, this research augments identification efficiency, curtails operational expenses, and provides enhanced tools for disease monitoring.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Nowadays, one of the important and indispensable conditions for the effectiveness and competitiveness of industrial companies is the high efficiency of manufacturing and assembly. These enterprises based on different methods and tools systematically monitor their efficiency metrics with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). One of these most frequently used metrics is Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), the product of availability, performance and quality. In addition to monitoring, it is also necessary to predict efficiency, which can be implemented with the support of machine learning techniques. This paper presents and compares several supervised machine learning techniques amongst other polynomial regression, lasso regression, ridge regression and gradient boost regression. The aim of this article is to determine the best estimation method for semiautomatic assembly line and large batch size. The case study presented with a real industrial example gives the answer as to which of the cumulative or rolling horizon prediction methods is more accurate.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Currently, the selection of web services with an uncertain quality of service (QoS) is gaining much attention in the service-oriented computing paradigm (SOC). In fact, searching for a service composition that fulfills a complex user's request is known to be NP-complete. The search time is mainly dependent on the number of requested tasks, the size of the available services, and the size of the QoS realizations (i.e., sample size). To handle this problem, we propose a two-stage approach that reduces the search space using heuristics for ranking the task services and a bat algorithm metaheuristic for selecting the final near-optimal compositions. The fitness used by the metaheuristic aims to fulfil all the global constraints of the user. The experimental study showed that the ranking heuristics, termed "fuzzy Pareto dominance" and "Zero-order stochastic dominance", are highly effective compared to the other heuristics and most of the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Predicting traffic risk incidents in first-person helps to ensure a safety reaction can occur before the incident happens for a wide range of driving scenarios and conditions. One challenge to building advanced driver assistance systems is to create an early warning system for the driver to react safely and accurately while perceiving the diversity of traffic-risk predictions in real-world applications. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by investigating two key research questions regarding the driver's current status of driving through online videos and the types of other moving objects that lead to dangerous situations. To address these problems, we proposed an end-to-end two-stage architecture: in the first stage, unsupervised learning is applied to collect all suspicious events on actual driving; in the second stage, supervised learning is used to classify all suspicious event results from the first stage to a common event type. To enrich the classification type, the metadata from the result of the first stage is sent to the second stage to handle the data limitation while training our classification model. Through the online situation, our method runs 9.60 fps on average with 1.44 fps on standard deviation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our method reaches 81.87% and 73.43% for the average F1-score on labeled data of CST-S3D and real driving datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method has the potential to assist distribution companies in evaluating the driving performance of their driver by automatically monitoring near-miss events and analyzing driving patterns for training programs to reduce future accidents.

AB Fuzzy time series forecasting is a methodology that incorporates fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty in time series data. It allows for more flexible and accurate predictions by considering the linguistic terms and membership functions associated with each data point, enabling a better representation of complex patterns and trends within the time series. A time series forecasting model examines the relationships between present and past observations for future measurement. This article proposes a hesitant fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF) technique for higher order based on one and two-factor aggregate fuzzy relationships. The proposed method presents a new approach to partitioning intervals into an unequal and equal length. The hesitant fuzzy sets are defined for each obser-vation, and fuzzification is based on their maximum score function. Further, aggregated triangular fuzzy numbers are defined using an aggregation operator corresponding to the fuzzified datum. In order to enhance forecasting performance, this work also introduces a novel defuzzification rule based on aggregated fuzzy logical relationship groups (AFLRGs) for higher order one and two-factor fuzzy time series. The implementation of the proposed approach is verified on two data sets to the forecasting of enrollment data and TAIFEX and TAIEX stock index data sets, and the forecasting error is tested in term of different statistical parameters. Thus, the model validates the effectiveness of the proposed method with higher forecasting accuracy rate in the environment hesitant fuzzy information.

AB Traffic state estimation (TSE) is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems. However, it is extremely challenging because the traffic data quality is often affected by the installation position of devices, data collection frequency, interference during the transmission process, etc., thus causing the problem of data sparsity or data missing. To address the issue of traffic state estimation under the scenario of data sparsity, we propose a TSE model that combines the computational graph with physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) methods. Firstly, we apply the computational graph method to determine the parameters of the traffic fundamental diagram. These parameters are embedded into the computational graph framework, and their values are determined through the forward propagation of variables and the backward propagation of errors. Next, we employ the PIDL method to realize TSE (taking the LWR model based on the Greenshields fundamental diagram as an example). The PIDL leverages the advantages of data-driven and model-driven approaches to achieve accurate traffic state estimation. Case studies are conducted using the NGSIM dataset under two sparse data scenarios: loop detectors and probe vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that PIDL can accurately reconstruct the traffic state of the entire road segment based on partially observed data. Furthermore, compared to pure deep learning methods and other baseline models, PIDL performs better in situations with sparse data, thereby proving the feasibility of integrating domain knowledge with deep learning frameworks. This paper fully acknowledges the issue of data sparsity in TSE and effectively addresses it by applying the PIDL method to achieve precise TSE, which holds significant implications for the control and management of real traffic flow.

DE Binary multi-view; Spectral rotation
AB Techniques for large-scale multi-view clustering have attracted increasing attention in recent years. To explore complementary and consensus information across multiple views, mapping multi-view data into a hamming space for binary multi-view learning is highly effective. However, for binary multi-view clustering, it is difficult to adopt the local manifold structure of original data into the consensus representation. Therefore, a novel algorithm named Binary Multi-View Clustering With Spectral Embedding (BMVC_SE) is proposed in this study. This algorithm unifies binary consensus representation learning and multi-view spectral learning into a joint framework. Specifically, this algorithm exploits the shareable and individual information across multi-view data to learn a binary consensus representation. Furthermore, spectral rotation technique is employed to embed manifold information from original multi-view data into binary consensus representation. Note that a multi view GPI algorithm is proposed in this study to obtain the better local manifold information. We also provide an effective optimization method to solve the existing method. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

AB Robots can learn how to complete a variety of tasks without explicit instructions thanks to reinforce-ment learning. In this work, a piece of cloth is placed on a table and manipulated using a single-arm robot. We consider 2 forms of manipulation: flattening a crumpled towel and folding a flat one. To learn a policy that will allow the robot to select the optimum course of action based on observations of the environment, we construct a simulation environment using a gripper and a piece of cloth. After that, the policy is applied to a real robot and put to the test. Additionally, we present our method for identifying the corners of a garment using computer vision, which includes a comparison between a traditional computer vision approach with a deep learning one. We use an ABB robot and a 2D camera for the experiments and PyBullet software for the simulation.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   controlled experiment; multiple domains
AB Despite several solutions and experiments have been conducted recently addressing image super-resolution (SR), boosted by deep learning (DL), they do not usually design evaluations with high scaling factors. Moreover, the datasets are generally benchmarks which do not truly encompass significant diversity of domains to proper evaluate the techniques. It is also interesting to remark that blind SR is attractive for real-world scenarios since it is based on the idea that the degradation process is unknown, and, hence, techniques in this context rely basically on low-resolution (LR) images. In this article, we present a high-scale (8x) experiment which evaluates five recent DL techniques tailored for blind image SR: Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation (APA), Blind Image SR with Spatially Variant Degradations (BlindSR), Deep Alternating Network (DAN), FastGAN, and Mixture of Experts Super-Resolution (MoESR). We consider 14 datasets from five different broader domains (Aerial, Fauna, Flora, Medical, and Satellite), and another remark is that some of the DL approaches were designed for single-image SR but others not. Based on two no-reference metrics, NIQE and the transformer-based MANIQA score, MoESR can be regarded as the best solution although the perceptual quality of the created high-resolution (HR) images of all the techniques still needs to improve.

AB For mobile cleaning robot navigation, it is crucial to not only base the motion decisions on the ego agent's capabilities but also to take into account other agents in the shared environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for learning motion policy conditioned not only on ego observations of the environment, but also on incoming information about other agents. First, we extend a replay buffer to collect state observations on all agents at the scene and create a simulation setting from which to gather the training samples for DRL policy. Next, we express the incoming agent information in each agent's frame of reference, thus making it translation and rotation invariant. We propose a neural network architecture with edge embedding layers that allows for the extraction of incoming information from a dynamic range of agents. This allows for generalization of the proposed approach to various settings with a variable number of agents at the scene. Through simulation results, we show that the introduction of edge layers improves the navigation policies in shared environments and performs better than other state-of-the-art DRL motion policy methods.

DE PID; fractional order; robustness; process control; stability
AB Managing industrial processes in real-time is challenging due to the nonlinearity and sensitivity of these processes. This unpredictability can cause delays in the regulation of these processes. The PID controller family is commonly used in these situations, but their performance is inadequate in systems and surroundings with varying set-points, longer dead times, external noises, and disturbances. Therefore, this research has developed a novel controller structure for PIDD(alpha )that incorporates the second derivative term from PIDD2 while exclusively using fractional order parameters for the second derivative term. The controllers' robust performance has been evaluated on four simulation plants: first order, second order with time delay, third-order magnetic levitation systems, and fourth-order automatic voltage regulation systems. The controllers' performance has also been evaluated on experimental models of pressure and flow processes. The proposed controller exhibits the least overshoot among all the systems tested. The overshoot for the first-order systems is 9.63%, for the third-order magnetic levitation system, it is 12.82%, and for the fourth-order automatic voltage regulation system, it is only 0.19%. In the pressure process plant, the overshoot is only 4.83%. All controllers for the second-order systems have a time delay, while the flow process plant has no overshoot. The proposed controller demonstrates superior settling times in various systems. For first-order systems, the settling time is 14.26 s, while in the pressure process plant, the settling time is 8.9543 s. Similarly, the proposed controllers for the second-order system with a time delay and the flow process plant have the same settling time of 46.0495 s. In addition, the proposed controller results in the lowest rise time for three different systems. The rise time is only 0.0075 s for the third-order magnetic levitation system, while the fourth-order automatic voltage regulation system has a rise time of 0.0232 s. Finally, for the flow process plant, the proposed controller has the least rise time of 25.7819 s. Thus, in all the cases, the proposed controller results in a more robust controller structure that provides the desired performance of a regular PIDD2 controller, offering better dynamic responses, shorter settling times, faster rise times, and reduced overshoot. Based on the analysis, it is evident that PIDD alpha outperforms both PID and FOPID control techniques due to its ability to produce a more robust control signal.

AB In this paper, a hybrid nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the Genetic Algorithm and the African Buffalo Optimization is proposed. The hybrid approach adaptively switches between the Genetic Algorithm and the African Buffalo Optimization during the optimization process, leveraging their respective strengths to improve performance. To improve randomness, the hybrid approach uses two high-quality pseudorandom number generators-the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the SIMD-Oriented Fast Mersenne Twister. The effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated on the NP-hard Container Relocation Problem, focusing on a test set of restricted Container Relocation Problems with higher complexity. The results show that the hybrid algorithm outperforms the individual Genetic Algorithm and the African Buffalo Optimization, which use standard pseudorandom number generators. The adaptive switch method allows the algorithm to adapt to different optimization problems and mitigate problems such as premature convergence and local optima. Moreover, the importance of pseudorandom number generator selection in metaheuristic algorithms is highlighted, as it directly affects the optimization results. The use of powerful pseudorandom number generators reduces the probability of premature convergence and local optima, leading to better optimization results. Overall, the research demonstrates the potential of hybrid metaheuristic approaches for solving complex optimization problems, which makes them relevant for scientific research and practical applications.

AB Visualization techniques for understanding and explaining machine learning models have gained significant attention. One such technique is the decision map, which creates a 2D depiction of the decision behavior of classifiers trained on high-dimensional data. While several decision map techniques have been proposed recently, such as Decision Boundary Maps (DBMs), Supervised Decision Boundary Maps (SDBMs), and DeepView (DV), there is no framework for comprehensively evaluating and comparing these techniques. In this paper, we propose such a framework by combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment. We apply our framework to DBM, SDBM, and DV using a range of both synthetic and real-world classification techniques and datasets. Our results show that none of the evaluated decision-map techniques consistently outperforms the others in all measured aspects. Separately, our analysis exposes several previously unknown properties and limitations of decision-map techniques. To support practitioners, we also propose a workflow for selecting the most appropriate decision-map technique for given datasets, classifiers, and requirements of the application at hand.

AB Continuous Ant-based Topology Search (CANTS) is a previously introduced novel nature-inspired neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that is based on ant colony optimization (ACO). CANTS utilizes a continuous search space to indirectly-encode a neural architecture search space. Synthetic ant agents explore CANTS' continuous search space based on the density and distribution of pheromones, strongly inspired by how ants move in the real world. This continuous search space allows CANTS to automate the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) of any size, removing a key limitation inherent to many current NAS algorithms that must operate within structures of a size that is predetermined by the user. This work expands CANTS by adding a fourth dimension to its search space representing potential neural synaptic weights. Adding this extra dimension allows CANTS agents to optimize both the architecture as well as the weights of an ANN without applying backpropagation (BP), which leads to a significant reduction in the time consumed in the optimization process: at least an average of 96% less time consumption with very competitive optimization performance, if not better. The experiments of this study - using real-world data - demonstrate that the BP-Free CANIS algorithm exhibits highly competitive performance compared to both CANTS and ANTS while requiring significantly less operation time.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Kuwaiti dialect is a particular dialect of Arabic spoken in Kuwait; it differs significantly from standard Arabic and the dialects of neighboring countries in the same region. Few research papers with a focus on the Kuwaiti dialect have been published in the field of NLP. In this study, we created Kuwaiti dialect language resources using Q8VaxStance, a vaccine stance labeling system for a large dataset of tweets. This dataset fills this gap and provides a valuable resource for researchers studying vaccine hesitancy in Kuwait. Furthermore, it contributes to the Arabic natural language processing field by providing a dataset for developing and evaluating machine learning models for stance detection in the Kuwaiti dialect. The proposed vaccine stance labeling system combines the benefits of weak supervised learning and zero-shot learning; for this purpose, we implemented 52 experiments on 42,815 unlabeled tweets extracted between December 2020 and July 2022. The results of the experiments show that using keyword detection in conjunction with zero-shot model labeling functions is significantly better than using only keyword detection labeling functions or just zero-shot model labeling functions. Furthermore, for the total number of generated labels, the difference between using the Arabic language in both the labels and prompt or a mix of Arabic labels and an English prompt is statistically significant, indicating that it generates more labels than when using English in both the labels and prompt. The best accuracy achieved in our experiments in terms of the Macro-F1 values was found when using keyword and hashtag detection labeling functions in conjunction with zero-shot model labeling functions, specifically in experiments KHZSLF-EE4 and KHZSLF-EA1, with values of 0.83 and 0.83, respectively. Experiment KHZSLF-EE4 was able to label 42,270 tweets, while experiment KHZSLF-EA1 was able to label 42,764 tweets. Finally, the average value of annotation agreement between the generated labels and human labels ranges between 0.61 and 0.64, which is considered a good level of agreement.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Anthropogenic disasters pose a challenge to management in the modern world. At the same time, it is important to have accurate and timely information to assess the level of danger and take appropriate measures to eliminate disasters. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to develop an effective method for assessing the level of anthropogenic disasters based on information from witnesses to the event. For this purpose, a conceptual model for assessing the consequences of anthropogenic disasters is proposed, the main components of which are the following ones: the analysis of collected data, modeling and assessment of their consequences. The main characteristics of the intelligent method for classifying the level of anthropogenic disasters are considered, in particular, exploratory data analysis using the EDA method, classification based on textual data using SMOTE, and data classification by the ensemble method of machine learning using boosting. The experimental results confirmed that for textual data, the best classification is at level V and level I with an error of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively, and the average error estimate is 0.68. For quantitative data, the classification accuracy of Potential Accident Level relative to Industry Sector is 77%, and the f1-score is 0.88, which indicates a fairly high accuracy of the model. The architecture of a mobile application for classifying the level of anthropogenic disasters has been developed, which reduces the time required to assess consequences of danger in the region. In addition, the proposed approach ensures interaction with dynamic and uncertain environments, which makes it an effective tool for classifying.

DE End-to-end; Incrementally predicting segments; Lexical constraints
AB Hard-constrained text generation is an important task that requires generating fluent sentences to include several specific keywords. It has numerous real-world applications, such as advertisement generation, keyword-based summary generation, and query rewriting. Although previous plug-and play approaches like enhanced beam search and stochastic search have been proven effective, they lack time efficiency and may reduce the quality of generated sentences. While end-to-end methods based on seq2seq models are superior in speed, they cannot guarantee that outputs satisfy all constraints. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end method for lexically constrained text generation via incrementally predicting segments (IPS) between every two adjacent lexical constraints using seq2seq models. Our approach guarantees that all constrained keywords will be included in the generated sentence. The experimental results show that our method not only satisfies all lexical constraints but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

ID PREDICTION
AB Traffic forecasting is an important task for transportation engineering as it helps authorities to plan and control traffic flow, detect congestion, and reduce environmental impact. Deep learning techniques have gained traction in handling such complex datasets, but require expertise in neural architecture engineering, often beyond the scope of traffic management decision-makers. Our study aims to address this challenge by using neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These methods, which simplify neural architecture engineering by discovering task-specific neural architectures, are only recently applied to traffic prediction. We specifically focus on the performance estimation of neural architectures, a computationally demanding sub-problem of NAS, that often hinders the real-world application of these methods. Extending prior work on evolutionary NAS (ENAS), our work evaluates the utility of zero-cost (ZC) proxies, recently emerged cost-effective evaluators of network architectures. These proxies operate without necessitating training, thereby circumventing the computational bottleneck, albeit at a slight cost to accuracy. Our findings indicate that, when integrated into the ENAS framework, ZC proxies can accelerate the search process by two orders of magnitude at a small cost of accuracy. These results establish the viability of ZC proxies as a practical solution to accelerate NAS methods while maintaining model accuracy. Our research contributes to the domain by showcasing how ZC proxies can enhance the accessibility and usability of NAS methods for traffic forecasting, despite potential limitations in neural architecture engineering expertise. This novel approach significantly aids in the efficient application of deep learning techniques in real-world traffic management scenarios.

AB Mobile learning has become increasingly important for higher education due to its numerous advantages and transformative potential. The aim of this study is to investigate how students perceive and utilize mobile learning (m-learning) services in universities. To achieve this objective, a conceptual model was developed, combining the TAM with additional new determinants, including perceived security, perceived trust, perceived risk, and service quality. The primary goal of this model is to assess the adoption of m-learning apps among users in university settings. To evaluate the proposed model, SEM was utilized to test the research model. The findings of the study highlight the critical roles of perceived security, perceived trust, and service quality in promoting the adoption of m-learning apps. Moreover, the results indicate that perceived risk negatively impacts both students' trust and their attitudes towards using mobile learning services. The study reveals that the perceived trust, and service quality factors positively influence students' attitudes towards adopting m-learning apps. These research findings hold significant implications for universities and academia, offering valuable insights to devise effective strategies for increasing the utilization of m- learning services among students. By gaining a deeper understanding of students' perceptions and acceptance, universities can optimize their m-learning offerings to cater to students' needs and preferences more effectively.

AB Confidence regions for the Weibull parameters with minimum areas among all those based on the Conditionality Principle are constructed using an equivalent diffuse Bayesian approach. The process is valid for scenarios involving standard failure and progressive censorship, and complete data. Optimal conditional confidence sets for two Weibull quantiles are also derived. Simulation-based algorithms are provided for computing the smallest-area regions with fixed confidence levels. Importantly, the proposed confidence sets satisfy the Sufficiency, Likelihood and Conditionality Principles in contrast to the unconditional regions based on maximum likelihood estimators and other insufficient statistics. The suggested perspective can be applied to parametric estimation and hypothesis testing, as well as to the determination of minimum-size confidence sets for other invariantly estimable functions of the Weibull parameters. A dataset concerning failure times of an insulating fluid is studied for illustrative and comparative purposes.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Mini-EUSO is a wide-angle fluorescence telescope that registers ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the nocturnal atmosphere of Earth from the International Space Station. Meteors are among multiple phenomena that manifest themselves not only in the visible range but also in the UV. We present two simple artificial neural networks that allow for recognizing meteor signals in the Mini-EUSO data with high accuracy in terms of a binary classification problem. We expect that similar architectures can be effectively used for signal recognition in other fluorescence telescopes, regardless of the nature of the signal. Due to their simplicity, the networks can be implemented in onboard electronics of future orbital or balloon experiments.

ID CIRCUMPLEX MODEL
AB Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own flawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI's models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5x semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.

AB Stream Reasoning (SR) focuses on developing advanced approaches for applying inference to dynamic data streams; it has become increasingly relevant in various application scenarios such as IoT, Smart Cities, Emergency Management, and Healthcare, despite being a relatively new field of research. The current lack of standardized formalisms and benchmarks has been hindering the comparison between different SR approaches. We proposed a new benchmark, called EnviroStream, for evaluating SR systems on weather and environmental data. The benchmark includes queries and datasets of different sizes. We adopted I-DLV-sr, a recently released SR system based on Answer Set Programming, as a baseline for query modelling and experimentation. We also showcased continuous online reasoning via a web application.

AB Social networks have become important objects of study in recent years. Social media marketing has, for example, greatly benefited from the vast literature developed in the past two decades. The study of social networks has taken advantage of recent advances in machine learning to process these immense amounts of data. Automatic emotional labeling of content on social media has, for example, been made possible by the recent progress in natural language processing. In this work, we are interested in the influence maximization problem, which consists of finding the most influential nodes in the social network. The problem is classically carried out using classical performance metrics such as accuracy or recall, which is not the end goal of the influence maximization problem. Our work presents an end-to-end learning model, SGREEDYNN, for the selection of the most influential nodes in a social network, given a history of information diffusion. In addition, this work proposes data visualization techniques to interpret the augmenting performances of our method compared to classical training. The results of this method are confirmed by visualizing the final influence of the selected nodes on network instances with edge bundling techniques. Edge bundling is a visual aggregation technique that makes patterns emerge. It has been shown to be an interesting asset for decision-making. By using edge bundling, we observe that our method chooses more diverse and high-degree nodes compared to the classical training.

AB Machine learning currently holds a vital position in predicting collision severity. Identifying factors associated with heightened risks of injury and fatalities aids in enhancing road safety measures and management. Presently, Thailand faces considerable challenges with respect to road traffic accidents. These challenges are particularly acute in industrial zones, where they contribute to a rise in injuries and fatalities. The mixture of heavy traffic, comprising both trucks and non-trucks, significantly amplifies the risk of accidents. This situation, hence, generates profound concerns for road safety in Thailand. Consequently, discerning the factors that influence the severity of injuries and fatalities becomes pivotal for formulating effective road safety policies and measures. This study is specifically aimed at predicting the factors contributing to the severity of accidents involving truck and non-truck collisions in industrial zones. It considers a variety of aspects, including roadway characteristics, underlying assumptions of cause, crash characteristics, and weather conditions. Due to the fact that accident data is big data with specific characteristics and complexity, with the employment of machine learning in tandem with the Multi-variate Adaptive Regression Splines technique, we can make precise predictions to identify the factors influencing the severity of collision outcomes. The analysis demonstrates that various factors augment the severity of accidents involving trucks. These include darting in front of a vehicle, head-on collisions, and pedestrian collisions. Conversely, for non-truck related collisions, the significant factors that heighten severity are tailgating, running signs/signals, angle collisions, head-on collisions, overtaking collisions, pedestrian collisions, obstruction collisions, and collisions during overcast conditions. These findings illuminate the significant factors influencing the severity of accidents involving trucks and non-trucks. Such insights provide invaluable information for developing targeted road safety measures and policies, thereby contributing to the mitigation of injuries and fatalities.

AB With the advancement of the 5G networks, edge computing (EC) assisted Internet of Things (IoT) based applications demand real-time computation and high-volume data-intensive services. Due to the heterogeneity and limited resources of the edge nodes (ENs), and dynamic resource demand of the IoT applications, it is challenging to place the IoT services into the available ENs by ensuring performance measurements on quality of services (QoS). In this paper, a novel quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization-based service placement (QPSO-SP) algorithm is proposed for EC environment. The QPSO-SP is intended to achieve desired service placement while optimizing throughput, energy consumption, delay, and computation load of the system. Quantum particle (QP) is designed to represent a complete solution for IoT service placement in an EC environment. Decoding of the QP is done by using a novel double-hashing technique. The fitness function uses throughput, delay, energy consumption, and load balancing parameters. Extensive simulation is performed and comparison is done with the standard existing algorithms. The parametric study, Taguchi method is conducted. The statistical analysis, ANOVA, followed by Friedman test is also done. The simulation results indicate that the proposed QPSO-SP outperforms existing works in terms of energy consumption, delay, throughput, and load balancing.

AB Many Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) based workers selection schemes have been proposed to select high-quality workers to enhance the quality of tasks. However, in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), a complex mutual effect exists among task requestors, the MCS platforms, and workers. Only considering the interaction of two sides doesn't make MCS a balanced ecosystem. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a tripartite mutual incentive mechanism to make the MCS system a balanced ecosystem. In this paper, a truth based Three-tier Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (TCMAB) incentive mechanism is proposed for selecting each other to maximize their revenues in MCS. In TCMAB, there exists a three-tier and two-way MAB-based incentive scheme. For the mutual interaction between the platform and the worker, a truth-based CMAB scheme is established for the platform to select high-quality workers, and also a CMAB scheme is proposed for workers to select a "good" platform to report data in order to maximize their revenue. Besides, for the mutual interaction between the task requestor and the platform, the platforms adopt the CMAB-based scheme to select a high-payment task requestor that gives high payment. And a platform selection scheme base on CMAB is also established for task requestors to select the platforms which have lower fees and higher quality. What's more, we don't adopt the assumption that platforms get the data quality as soon as they get data, but propose a data quality acquisition scheme based on the truth data discovery and cooperation frequency, which is the base to instruct the three-tier interaction, thus establish a kind of truth-based MCS interaction ecosystems. Simulation results show that the proposed TCMAB provides an effective solution for the problem of information elicitation without verification (IEWV) in MCS, and can improve the utilities, data quality, and applications quality for MCS, which is not achieved in the previous studies significantly.

AB The authors propose a multifunctional intelligent bed (MIB) that integrates multiple modes of interaction to improve the welfare of mobility-impaired users and reduce the workload of medical personnel. The MIB features independent autonomous omnidirectional movement, position adjustment, multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) movement regulation and posture memory functions to facilitate comfortable and convenient interaction for mobility-impaired users. In particular, an integrated "MIB-state perception-interaction interfaces" system is established, and a bed fall risk detection algorithm and assisted get-up-transfer algorithm is proposed. By recognising and sharing human body state characteristics, nursing collaboration can be achieved with caregivers or other nursing robots. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the MIB is a novel MIB that is highly adaptable to the environment, convenient to interact with and safe. By integrating the proposed algorithms, daily safety monitoring, assisted get-up and defecation tasks can be effectively accomplished. This technology demonstrates excellent applicability and promising prospects for implementation in hospitals, nursing centres and homes catering to elderly and disabled individuals with mobility impairments.

DE interpretable machine learning; decision rule sets; tabular learning
AB This paper extends recent work on decision rule learning from neural networks for tabular data classification. We propose alternative formulations to trainable Boolean logic operators as neurons with continuous weights, including trainable NAND neurons. These alternative formulations provide uniform treatments to different trainable logic neurons so that they can be uniformly trained, which enables, for example, the direct application of existing sparsity-promoting neural net training techniques like reweighted L1 regularization to derive sparse networks that translate to simpler rules. In addition, we present an alternative network architecture based on trainable NAND neurons by applying De Morgan's law to realize a NAND-NAND network instead of an AND-OR network, both of which can be readily mapped to decision rule sets. Our experimental results show that these alternative formulations can also generate accurate decision rule sets that achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy in tabular learning applications.

ID MODEL
AB The concept of a digital twin (DT) has gained significant attention in academia and industry because of its perceived potential to address critical global challenges, such as climate change, healthcare, and economic crises. Originally introduced in manufacturing, many attempts have been made to present proper definitions of this concept. Unfortunately, there remains a great deal of confusion surrounding the underlying concept, with many scientists still uncertain about the distinction between a simulation, a mathematical model and a DT. The aim of this paper is to propose a formal definition of a digital twin. To achieve this goal, we utilize a data science framework that facilitates a functional representation of a DT and other components that can be combined together to form a larger entity we refer to as a digital twin system (DTS). In our framework, a DT is an open dynamical system with an updating mechanism, also referred to as complex adaptive system (CAS). Its primary function is to generate data via simulations, ideally, indistinguishable from its physical counterpart. On the other hand, a DTS provides techniques for analyzing data and decision-making based on the generated data. Interestingly, we find that a DTS shares similarities to the principles of general systems theory. This multi-faceted view of a DTS explains its versatility in adapting to a wide range of problems in various application domains such as engineering, manufacturing, urban planning, and personalized medicine.

AB Predicting emissions for gas turbines is critical for monitoring harmful pollutants being released into the atmosphere. In this study, we evaluate the performance of machine learning models for predicting emissions for gas turbines. We compared an existing predictive emissions model, a first-principles-based Chemical Kinetics model, against two machine learning models we developed based on the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer (SAINT) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with the aim to demonstrate the improved predictive performance of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) using machine learning techniques and determine whether XGBoost or a deep learning model performs the best on a specific real-life gas turbine dataset. Our analysis utilises a Siemens Energy gas turbine test bed tabular dataset to train and validate the machine learning models. Additionally, we explore the trade-off between incorporating more features to enhance the model complexity, and the resulting presence of increased missing values in the dataset.

AB (1) Background: Avatar Therapy (AT) is currently being studied to help patients suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Facilitating annotations of immersive verbatims in AT by using classification algorithms could be an interesting avenue to reduce the time and cost of conducting such analysis and adding objective quantitative data in the classification of the different interactions taking place during the therapy. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms in the automatic annotation of immersive session verbatims of AT. (2) Methods: Five machine learning algorithms were implemented over a dataset as per the Scikit-Learn library: Support vector classifier, Linear support vector classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Multi-layer perceptron classifier. The dataset consisted of the 27 different types of interactions taking place in AT for the Avatar and the patient for 35 patients who underwent eight immersive sessions as part of their treatment in AT. (3) Results: The Linear SVC performed best over the dataset as compared with the other algorithms with the highest accuracy score, recall score, and F1-Score. The regular SVC performed best for precision. (4) Conclusions: This study presented an objective method for classifying textual interactions based on immersive session verbatims and gave a first comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms on AT.

AB Typically, renewable-power-generation forecasting using machine learning involves creating separate models for each photovoltaic or wind park, known as single-task learning models. However, transfer learning has gained popularity in recent years, as it allows for the transfer of knowledge from source parks to target parks. Nevertheless, determining the most similar source park(s) for transfer learning can be challenging, particularly when the target park has limited or no historical data samples. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task learning architecture that employs a Unified Autoencoder (UAE) to initially learn a common representation of input weather features among tasks and then utilizes a Task-Embedding layer in a Neural Network (TENN) to learn task-specific information. This proposed UAE-TENN architecture can be easily extended to new parks with or without historical data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture and compare it to single-task learning models on six photovoltaic and wind farm datasets consisting of a total of 529 parks. Our results show that the UAE-TENN architecture significantly improves power-forecasting performance by 10 to 19% for photovoltaic parks and 5 to 15% for wind parks compared to baseline models. We also demonstrate that UAE-TENN improves forecast accuracy for a new park by 19% for photovoltaic parks, even in a zero-shot learning scenario where there is no historical data. Additionally, we propose variants of the Unified Autoencoder with convolutional and LSTM layers, compare their performance, and provide a comparison among architectures with different numbers of task-embedding dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of trained task embeddings for interpretation and visualization purposes.

AB A multilayered bidirectional associative memory neural network is proposed to account for learning nonlinear types of association. The model (denoted as the MF-BAM) is composed of two modules, the Multi-Feature extracting bidirectional associative memory (MF), which contains various unsupervised network layers, and a modified Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), which consists of a single supervised network layer. The MF generates successive feature patterns from the original inputs. These patterns change the relationship between the inputs and targets in a way that the BAM can learn. The model was tested on different nonlinear tasks, such as the N-bit, Double Moon and its variants, and the 3-class spiral task. Behaviors were reported through learning errors, decision zones, and recall performances. Results showed that it was possible to learn all tasks consistently. By manipulating the number of units per layer and the number of unsupervised network layers in the MF, it was possible to change the level of nonlinearity observed in the decision boundaries. Furthermore, results indicated that different behaviors were achieved from the same set of inputs by using the different generated patterns. These findings are significant as they showed how a BAM-inspired model could solve nonlinear tasks in a more cognitively plausible fashion.'& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Few-shot learning (FSL) describes the challenge of learning a new task using a minimum amount of labeled data, and we have observed significant progress made in this area. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of the FSL theory by considering a real-world problem where labels are hard to obtain. To assist a large study on chimpanzee hunting activities, we aim to classify various animal species that appear in our in-the-wild camera traps located in Senegal. Using the philosophy of FSL, we aim to train an FSL network to learn to separate animal species using large public datasets and implement the network on our data with its novel species/classes and unseen environments, needing only to label a few images per new species. Here, we first discuss constraints and challenges caused by having in-the-wild uncurated data, which are often not addressed in benchmark FSL datasets. Considering these new challenges, we create two experiments and corresponding evaluation metrics to determine a network's usefulness in a real-world implementation scenario. We then compare results from various FSL networks, and describe how factors may affect a network's potential real-world usefulness. We consider network design factors such as distance metrics or extra pre-training, and examine their roles in a real-world implementation setting. We also consider additional factors such as support set selection and ease of implementation, which are usually ignored when a benchmark dataset has been established.

AB The concept of a digital twin is intriguing as it presents an innovative approach to solving numerous real-world challenges. Initially emerging from the domains of manufacturing and engineering, digital twin research has transcended its origins and now finds applications across a wide range of disciplines. This multidisciplinary expansion has impressively demonstrated the potential of digital twin research. While the simulation aspect of a digital twin is often emphasized, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is severely understudied. For this reason, in this paper, we highlight the pivotal role of AI and ML for digital twin research. By recognizing that a digital twin is a component of a broader Digital Twin System (DTS), we can fully grasp the diverse applications of AI and ML. In this paper, we explore six AI techniques-(1) optimization (model creation), (2) optimization (model updating), (3) generative modeling, (4) data analytics, (5) predictive analytics and (6) decision making-and their potential to advance applications in health, climate science, and sustainability.

AB In the last few years, fog computing has been recognized as a promising approach to support modern IoT applications based on microservices. The main characteristic of this application involve the presence of geographically distributed sensors or mobile end users acting as sources of data. Relying on a cloud computing approach may not represent the most suitable solution in these scenario due to the non-negligible latency between data sources and distant cloud data centers, which may represent an issue in cases involving real-time and latency-sensitive IoT applications. Placing certain tasks, such as preprocessing or data aggregation, in a layer of fog nodes close to sensors or end users may help to decrease the response time of IoT applications as well as the traffic towards the cloud data centers. However, the fog scenario is characterized by a much more complex and heterogeneous infrastructure compared to a cloud data center, where the computing nodes and the inter-node connecting are more homogeneous. As a consequence, the the problem of efficiently placing microservices over distributed fog nodes requires novel and efficient solutions. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing and comparing different heuristics for placing the application microservices over the nodes of a fog infrastructure. We test the performance of the proposed heuristics and their ability to minimize application response times and satisfy the Service Level Agreement across a wide set of operating conditions in order to understand which approach is performs the best depending on the IoT application scenario.

ID SCHEMES
AB A neural-network-assisted numerical method is proposed for the solution of Laplace and Poisson problems. Finite differences are applied to approximate the spatial Laplacian operator on nonuniform grids. For this, a neural network is trained to compute the corresponding coefficients for general quadrilateral meshes. Depending on the position of a given grid point x0 and its neighbors, we face with a nonlinear optimization problem to obtain the finite difference coefficients in x0. This computing step is executed with an artificial neural network. In this way, for any geometric setup of the neighboring grid points, we immediately obtain the corresponding coefficients. The construction of an appropriate training data set is also discussed, which is based on the solution of overdetermined linear systems. The method was experimentally validated on a number of numerical tests. As expected, it delivers a fast and reliable algorithm for solving Poisson problems.

TI Machine-Learning-Based Imputation Method for Filling Missing Values in

DE meteorological data; missing value imputation; machine learning;

AB Ground meteorological observation data (GMOD) are the core of research on earth-related disciplines and an important reference for societal production and life. Unfortunately, due to operational issues or equipment failures, missing values may occur in GMOD. Hence, the imputation of missing data is a prevalent issue during the pre-processing of GMOD. Although a large number of machine-learning methods have been applied to the field of meteorological missing value imputation and have achieved good results, they are usually aimed at specific meteorological elements, and few studies discuss imputation when multiple elements are randomly missing in the dataset. This paper designed a machine-learning-based multidimensional meteorological data imputation framework (MMDIF), which can use the predictions of machine-learning methods to impute the GMOD with random missing values in multiple attributes, and tested the effectiveness of 20 machine-learning methods on imputing missing values within 124 meteorological stations across six different climatic regions based on the MMDIF. The results show that MMDIF-RF was the most effective missing value imputation method; it is better than other methods for imputing 11 types of hourly meteorological elements. Although this paper applied MMDIF to the imputation of missing values in meteorological data, the method can also provide guidance for dataset reconstruction in other industries.

AB This study proposes a hybrid gene selection method to identify and predict key genes in Arabidopsis associated with various stresses (including salt, heat, cold, high-light, and flagellin), aiming to enhance crop tolerance. An open-source microarray dataset (GSE41935) comprising 207 samples and 30,380 genes was analyzed using several machine learning tools including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), information gain (IG), ReliefF, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), along with various classifiers (BayesNet, logistic, multilayer perceptron, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and random forest). We identified 439 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which only three were down-regulated (AT3G20810, AT1G31680, and AT1G30250). The performance of the top 20 genes selected by IG and ReliefF was evaluated using the classifiers mentioned above to classify stressed versus non-stressed samples. The random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms with an accuracy of 97.91% and 98.51% for IG and ReliefF, respectively. Additionally, 42 genes were identified from all 30,380 genes using LASSO regression. The top 20 genes for each feature selection were analyzed to determine three common genes (AT5G44050, AT2G47180, and AT1G70700), which formed a three-gene signature. The efficiency of these three genes was evaluated using random forest and XGBoost algorithms. Further validation was performed using an independent RNA_seq dataset and random forest. These gene signatures can be exploited in plant breeding to improve stress tolerance in a variety of crops.

AB This paper examines the relationship between user pageview (PV) histories and their itemchoice behavior on an e-commerce website. We focus on PV sequences, which represent time series of the number of PVs for each user-item pair. We propose a shape-restricted optimization model that accurately estimates item-choice probabilities for all possible PV sequences. This model imposes monotonicity constraints on item-choice probabilities by exploiting partial orders for PV sequences, according to the recency and frequency of a user's previous PVs. To improve the computational efficiency of our optimization model, we devise efficient algorithms for eliminating all redundant constraints according to the transitivity of the partial orders. Experimental results using real-world clickstream data demonstrate that our method achieves higher prediction performance than that of a state-of-the-art optimization model and common machine learning methods.

ID VARIABLE SELECTION; PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD
AB This article reviews several implementation aspects in estimating regularized single-group and multiple-group structural equation models (SEM). It is demonstrated that approximate estimation approaches that rely on a differentiable approximation of non-differentiable penalty functions perform similarly to the coordinate descent optimization approach of regularized SEMs. Furthermore, using a fixed regularization parameter can sometimes be superior to an optimal regularization parameter selected by the Bayesian information criterion when it comes to the estimation of structural parameters. Moreover, the widespread penalty functions of regularized SEM implemented in several R packages were compared with the estimation based on a recently proposed penalty function in the Mplus software. Finally, we also investigate the performance of a clever replacement of the optimization function in regularized SEM with a smoothed differentiable approximation of the Bayesian information criterion proposed by O'Neill and Burke in 2023. The findings were derived through two simulation studies and are intended to guide the practical implementation of regularized SEM in future software pieces.

AB Automated scoring systems have been revolutionized by natural language processing, enabling the evaluation of students' diverse answers across various academic disciplines. However, this presents a challenge as students' responses may vary significantly in terms of length, structure, and content. To tackle this challenge, this research introduces a novel automated model for short answer grading. The proposed model uses pretrained "transformer" models, specifically T5, in conjunction with a BI-LSTM architecture which is effective in processing sequential data by considering the past and future context. This research evaluated several preprocessing techniques and different hyperparameters to identify the most efficient architecture. Experiments were conducted using a standard benchmark dataset named the North Texas Dataset. This research achieved a state-of-the-art correlation value of 92.5 percent. The proposed model's accuracy has significant implications for education as it has the potential to save educators considerable time and effort, while providing a reliable and fair evaluation for students, ultimately leading to improved learning outcomes.

AB This study is devoted to the transcription of human speech in the Kazakh language in dynamically changing conditions. It discusses key aspects related to the phonetic structure of the Kazakh language, technical considerations in collecting the transcribed audio corpus, and the use of deep neural networks for speech modeling. A high-quality decoded audio corpus was collected, containing 554 h of data, giving an idea of the frequencies of letters and syllables, as well as demographic parameters such as the gender, age, and region of residence of native speakers. The corpus contains a universal vocabulary and serves as a valuable resource for the development of modules related to speech. Machine learning experiments were conducted using the DeepSpeech2 model, which includes a sequence-to-sequence architecture with an encoder, decoder, and attention mechanism. To increase the reliability of the model, filters initialized with symbol-level embeddings were introduced to reduce the dependence on accurate positioning on object maps. The training process included simultaneous preparation of convolutional filters for spectrograms and symbolic objects. The proposed approach, using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, resulted in a 66.7% reduction in the weight of the model while maintaining relative accuracy. The evaluation on the test sample showed a 7.6% lower character error rate (CER) compared to existing models, demonstrating its most modern characteristics. The proposed architecture provides deployment on platforms with limited resources. Overall, this study presents a high-quality audio corpus, an improved speech recognition model, and promising results applicable to speech-related applications and languages beyond Kazakh.

AB This paper aims to address the issue of evaluating the operation of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). Previous studies have commonly employed the method of constructing comprehensive evaluation systems, which greatly relies on manual experience for index selection and weight allocation. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an evaluation method based on natural language models for assessing the operation of charging stations. By utilizing the proposed SimCSEBERT model, this study analyzes the operational data, user charging data, and basic information of charging stations to predict the operational status and identify influential factors. Additionally, this study compared the evaluation accuracy and impact factor analysis accuracy of the baseline and the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a higher evaluation accuracy (operation evaluation accuracy = 0.9464; impact factor analysis accuracy = 0.9492) and effectively assesses the operation of EVCSs. Compared with traditional evaluation methods, this approach exhibits improved universality and a higher level of intelligence. It provides insights into the operation of EVCSs and user demands, allowing for the resolution of supply-demand contradictions that are caused by power supply constraints and the uneven distribution of charging demands. Furthermore, it offers guidance for more efficient and targeted strategies for the operation of charging stations.

AB At present, the design of modern vehicles requires improving driving performance while meeting emission standards, leading to increasingly complex power systems. In autonomous driving systems, accurate, real-time vehicle speed prediction is one of the key factors in achieving automated driving. Accurate prediction and optimal control based on future vehicle speeds are key strategies for dealing with ever-changing and complex actual driving environments. However, predicting driver behavior is uncertain and may be influenced by the surrounding driving environment, such as weather and road conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a real-time vehicle speed prediction method based on a lightweight deep learning model driven by big temporal data. Firstly, the temporal data collected by automotive sensors are decomposed into a feature matrix through empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Then, an informer model based on the attention mechanism is designed to extract key information for learning and prediction. During the iterative training process of the informer, redundant parameters are removed through importance measurement criteria to achieve real-time inference. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior speed prediction performance through comparing it with state-of-the-art statistical modelling methods and deep learning models. Tests on edge computing devices also confirmed that the designed model can meet the requirements of actual tasks.

TI Block-Wise Partner Learning for Model Compression

DE Block-wise partner learning (BPL); model compression; partner fusion in
   inference; remote-sensing image classification
AB Despite the great potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various tasks, the resource-hungry nature greatly hinders their wide deployment in cost-sensitive and low-powered scenarios, especially applications in remote sensing. Existing model pruning approaches, implemented by a "subtraction" operation, impose a performance ceiling on the slimmed model. Self-knowledge distillation (Self-KD) resorts to auxiliary networks that are only active in the training phase for performance improvement. However, the knowledge is holistic and crude, and the learning-based knowledge transfer is mediate and lossy. Here, we propose a novel model-compression method, termed block-wise partner learning (BPL), which comprises "extension" and "fusion" operations and liberates the compressed model from the bondage of baseline. Different from the Self-KD, the proposed BPL creates a partner for each block for performance enhancement in training. For the model to absorb more diverse information, a diversity loss (DL) is designed to evaluate the difference between the original block and the partner. Besides, the partner is fused equivalently instead of being discarded directly. After training, we can simply adopt the fused compressed model that contains the enhancement information of partners but with fewer parameters and less inference cost. As validated using the UC Merced land-use, NWPU-RESISC45, and RSD46-WHU datasets, the BPL demonstrates superiority over other compared model-compression approaches. For example, it attains a substantial floating-point operations (FLOPs) reduction of 73.97% with only 0.24 accuracy (ACC.) loss for ResNet-50 on the UC Merced land-use dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangxin-xd/BPL.

AB Dynamic arrays, also referred to as vectors, are fundamental data structures used in many programs. Modeling their semantics efficiently is crucial when reasoning about such programs. The theory of arrays is widely supported but is not ideal, because the number of elements is fixed (determined by its index sort) and cannot be adjusted, which is a problem, given that the length of vectors often plays an important role when reasoning about vector programs. In this paper, we propose reasoning about vectors using a theory of sequences. We introduce the theory, propose a basic calculus adapted from one for the theory of strings, and extend it to efficiently handle common vector operations. We prove that our calculus is sound and show how to construct a model when it terminates with a saturated configuration. Finally, we describe an implementation of the calculus in cvc5 and demonstrate its efficacy by evaluating it on verification conditions for smart contracts and benchmarks derived from existing array benchmarks.

AB With the ongoing development of automated driving systems, the crucial task of predicting pedestrian behavior is attracting growing attention. The prediction of future pedestrian trajectories from the ego-vehicle camera perspective is particularly challenging due to the dynamically changing scene. Therefore, we present Behavior-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (BA-PTP), a novel approach to pedestrian trajectory prediction for ego-centric camera views. It incorporates behavioral features extracted from real-world traffic scene observations such as the body and head orientation of pedestrians, as well as their pose, in addition to positional information from body and head bounding boxes. For each input modality, we employed independent encoding streams that are combined through a modality attention mechanism. To account for the ego-motion of the camera in an ego-centric view, we introduced Spatio-Temporal Ego-Motion Module (STEMM), a novel approach to ego-motion prediction. Compared to the related works, it utilizes spatial goal points of the ego-vehicle that are sampled from its intended route. We experimentally validated the effectiveness of our approach using two datasets for pedestrian behavior prediction in urban traffic scenes. Based on ablation studies, we show the advantages of incorporating different behavioral features for pedestrian trajectory prediction in the image plane. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefit of integrating STEMM into our pedestrian trajectory prediction method, BA-PTP. BA-PTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE dataset, outperforming prior work by 7% in MSE-1.5 s and CMSE as well as 9% in CFMSE.

AB This paper presents a solution for an autonomously driven vehicle (a robotic car) based on artificial intelligence using a supervised learning method. A scaled-down robotic car containing only one camera as a sensor was developed to participate in the RoboCup Portuguese Open Autonomous Driving League competition. This study is based solely on the development of this robotic car, and the results presented are only from this competition. Teams usually solve the competition problem by relying on computer vision algorithms, and no research could be found on neural network model-based assistance for vehicle control. This technique is commonly used in general autonomous driving, and the amount of research is increasing. To train a neural network, a large number of labelled images is necessary; however, these are difficult to obtain. In order to address this problem, a graphical simulator was used with an environment containing the track and the robot/car to extract images for the dataset. A classical computer vision algorithm developed by the authors processes the image data to extract relevant information about the environment and uses it to determine the optimal direction for the vehicle to follow on the track, which is then associated with the respective image-grab. Several trainings were carried out with the created dataset to reach the final neural network model; tests were performed within a simulator, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach was additionally demonstrated through experimental results in two real robotics cars, which performed better than expected. This system proved to be very successful in steering the robotic car on a road-like track, and the agent's performance increased with the use of supervised learning methods. With computer vision algorithms, the system performed an average of 23 complete laps around the track before going off-track, whereas with assistance from the neural network model the system never went off the track.

To solve the problem of disease detection in complex backgrounds, where the distinction between plant diseases is hindered by large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences, a complete plant-disease recognition process is proposed. The process was tested through experiments and research into traditional and deep features. In the face of difficulties related to plant-disease classification in complex backgrounds, the advantages of strong interpretability of traditional features and great robustness of deep features are fully utilized, and include the following components: (1) The OSTU algorithm based on the naive Bayes model is proposed to focus on where leaves are located and remove interference from complex backgrounds. (2) A multi-dimensional feature model is introduced in an interpretable manner from the perspective of traditional features to obtain leaf characteristics. (3) A MobileNet V2 network with a dual attention mechanism is proposed to establish a model that operates in both spatial and channel dimensions at the network level to facilitate plant-disease recognition. In the Plant Village open database test, the results demonstrated an average SEN of 94%, greater than other algorithms by 12.6%.

AB Jurisdictions currently provide information on winter road conditions through qualitative descriptors like bare and fully snow-covered. Ideally, these descriptors are meant to warn drivers beforehand about hazardous roads. In practice, however, discerning between safe and unsafe roads is sometimes unclear due to intermediate RSC classes covering too wide a range of conditions. This study aims at solving this safety ambiguity issue by proposing a framework for predicting collision likelihood within a road segment. The proposed framework converts road surface images into friction coefficients, which are then converted into continuous measurements through an interpolator. To find the best-performing interpolator, we evaluated geostatistical, machine learning, and hybrid interpolators. It was found that ordinary kriging had the lowest estimation error and was the least sensitive to changes in distance between measurements. After developing an interpolator, collision likelihood models were developed for segment lengths ranging from 0.5 km to 20 km. We chose the 6.5 km model based on its accuracy and intuitiveness. This model had 76.9% accuracy and included friction and AADT as predictors. It was also estimated that if the proposed framework were implemented in an environment with connected vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, it would offer significant safety improvements.

AB The digital twin (DT) research field is experiencing rapid expansion; yet, the research on industrial practices in this area remains poorly understood. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by sharing feedback and future requirements from the manufacturing industry. The methodology employed in this study involves an examination of a survey that received 99 responses and interviews with 14 experts from 10 prominent UK organisations, most of which are involved in the defence industry in the UK. The survey and interviews explored topics such as DT design, return on investment, drivers, inhibitors, and future directions for DT development in manufacturing. This study's findings indicate that DTs should possess characteristics such as adaptability, scalability, interoperability, and the ability to support assets throughout their entire life cycle. On average, completed DT projects reach the breakeven point in less than two years. The primary motivators behind DT development were identified to be autonomy, customer satisfaction, safety, awareness, optimisation, and sustainability. Meanwhile, the main obstacles include a lack of expertise, funding, and interoperability. This study concludes that the federation of twins and a paradigm shift in industrial thinking are essential components for the future of DT development.

DE machine learning; deep learning; classification; Hadith classification;
   religious studies; Natural Language Processing
AB Religious studies are a rich land for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The reason is that all religions have their instructions as written texts. In this paper, we apply NLP to Islamic Hadiths, which are the written traditions, sayings, actions, approvals, and discussions of the Prophet Muhammad, his companions, or his followers. A Hadith is composed of two parts: the chain of narrators (Sanad) and the content of the Hadith (Matn). A Hadith is transmitted from its author to a Hadith book author using a chain of narrators. The problem we solve focuses on the classification of Hadiths based on their origin of narration. This is important for several reasons. First, it helps determine the authenticity and reliability of the Hadiths. Second, it helps trace the chain of narration and identify the narrators involved in transmitting Hadiths. Finally, it helps understand the historical and cultural contexts in which Hadiths were transmitted, and the different levels of authority attributed to the narrators. To the best of our knowledge, and based on our literature review, this problem is not solved before using machine/deep learning approaches. To solve this classification problem, we created a novel Author-Based Hadith Classification Dataset (ABCD) collected from classical Hadiths' books. The ABCD size is 29 K Hadiths and it contains unique 18 K narrators, with all their information. We applied machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. ML was applied on Sanad and Matn separately; then, we did the same with DL. The results revealed that ML performs better than DL using the Matn input data, with a 77% F1-score. DL performed better than ML using the Sanad input data, with a 92% F1-score. We used precision and recall alongside the F1-score; details of the results are explained at the end of the paper. We claim that the ABCD and the reported results will motivate the community to work in this new area. Our dataset and results will represent a baseline for further research on the same problem.

AB Exploring multi-level information to obtain fine-grained features is the key factor to improve the performance of person re-identification (Re-ID). However, existing models for person Re-ID only focus on learning the highlevel semantic information while neglecting the low-level detail information. To alleviate this issue, we propose a lightweight person Re-ID method termed Multi-Scale Semantic and Detail Extraction Network (MSDENet) to obtain robustness and discriminative feature representation for the Re-ID task. Specifically, we design a Series Channel-Spatial Attention (SCSA) and embed it into the lightweight backbone network to focus on the key parts of pedestrian images. Meanwhile, we propose a Multi-Scale Semantic and Detail Extraction (MSDE) method to extract multi-scale features of semantic information and detail information, which can effectively capture the feature diversity of pedestrian images. Furthermore, we design a Feature Enhancement Fusion (FEF), which enhances and fuses the fine-grained features of semantic extraction and detail extraction branches to better obtain the discriminative feature representation. Extensive experiments conducted on popular datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and CUHK03 demonstrate that the proposed MSDENet has competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, over 760 million confirmed cases and over 6.8 million deaths have been reported globally, according to the World Health Organization. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus carried by COVID-19 patients can be identified though the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test with high accuracy, clinical misdiagnosis between COVID-19 and pneumonia patients remains a challenge. Therefore, we developed a novel CovC-ReDRNet model to distinguish COVID-19 patients from pneumonia patients as well as normal cases. ResNet-18 was introduced as the backbone model and tailored for the feature representation afterward. In our feature-based randomized neural network (RNN) framework, the feature representation automatically pairs with the deep random vector function link network (dRVFL) as the optimal classifier, producing a CovC-ReDRNet model for the classification task. Results based on five-fold cross-validation reveal that our method achieved 94.94%, 97.01%, 97.56%, 96.81%, and 95.84% MA sensitivity, MA specificity, MA accuracy, MA precision, and MA F1-score, respectively. Ablation studies evidence the superiority of ResNet-18 over different backbone networks, RNNs over traditional classifiers, and deep RNNs over shallow RNNs. Moreover, our proposed model achieved a better MA accuracy than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the highest score of which was 95.57%. To conclude, our CovC-ReDRNet model could be perceived as an advanced computer-aided diagnostic model with high speed and high accuracy for classifying and predicting COVID-19 diseases.

AB The use of back propagation through the time learning rule enabled the supervised training of deep spiking neural networks to process temporal neuromorphic data. However, their performance is still below non-spiking neural networks. Previous work pointed out that one of the main causes is the limited number of neuromorphic data currently available, which are also difficult to generate. With the goal of overcoming this problem, we explore the usage of auxiliary learning as a means of helping spiking neural networks to identify more general features. Tests are performed on neuromorphic DVS-CIFAR10 and DVS128-Gesture datasets. The results indicate that training with auxiliary learning tasks improves their accuracy, albeit slightly. Different scenarios, including manual and automatic combination losses using implicit differentiation, are explored to analyze the usage of auxiliary tasks.

AB Thyroid disease is among the most prevalent endocrinopathies worldwide. As the thyroid gland controls human metabolism, thyroid illness is a matter of concern for human health. To save time and reduce error rates, an automatic, reliable, and accurate thyroid identification machine-learning (ML) system is essential. The proposed model aims to address existing work limitations such as the lack of detailed feature analysis, visualization, improvement in prediction accuracy, and reliability. Here, a public thyroid illness dataset containing 29 clinical features from the University of California, Irvine ML repository was used. The clinical features helped us to build an ML model that can predict thyroid illness by analyzing early symptoms and replacing the manual analysis of these attributes. Feature analysis and visualization facilitate an understanding of the role of features in thyroid prediction tasks. In addition, the overfitting problem was eliminated by 5-fold cross-validation and data balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Ensemble learning ensures prediction model reliability owing to the involvement of multiple classifiers in the prediction decisions. The proposed model achieved 99.5% accuracy, 99.39% sensitivity, and 99.59% specificity with the boosting method which is applicable to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to ease diagnosis and promote early treatment.

AB Understanding the dynamics of complex molecular processes is often linked to the study of infrequent transitions between long-lived stable states. The standard approach to the sampling of such rare events is to generate an ensemble of transition paths using a random walk in trajectory space. This, however, comes with the drawback of strong correlations between subsequently sampled paths and with an intrinsic difficulty in parallelizing the sampling process. We propose a transition path sampling scheme based on neural-network generated configurations. These are obtained employing normalizing flows, a neural network class able to generate statistically independent samples from a given distribution. With this approach, not only are correlations between visited paths removed, but the sampling process becomes easily parallelizable. Moreover, by conditioning the normalizing flow, the sampling of configurations can be steered towards regions of interest. We show that this approach enables the resolution of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transition region for systems that can be sampled using exact-likelihood generative models.

AB In recent years, deep neural networks have been employed to approximate nonlinear continuous functionals F defined on L-p([-1, 1](s)) for 1 < p < 8. However, the existing theoretical analysis in the literature either is unsatisfactory due to the poor approximation results, or does not apply to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. This paper aims to investigate the approximation power of functional deep ReLU networks in two settings: F is continuous with restrictions on the modulus of continuity, and F has higher order Fr & eacute;chet derivatives. A novel functional network structure is proposed to extract features of higher order smoothness harbored by the target functional F. Quantitative rates of approximation in terms of the depth, width and total number of weights of neural networks are derived for both settings. We give logarithmic rates when measuring the approximation error on the unit ball of a H & ouml;lder space. In addition, we establish nearly polynomial rates (i.e., rates of the form exp (-a(logM)(b)) with a > 0, 0 < b < 1) when measuring the approximation error on a space of analytic functions.

AB In the field of precision agriculture, diagnosing rice diseases from images remains challenging due to high error rates, multiple influencing factors, and unstable conditions. While machine learning and convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in identifying rice diseases, they were limited in their ability to explain the relationships among disease features. In this study, we proposed an improved rice disease classification method that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). Specifically, we introduced a residual mechanism into the Inception module, expanded the module's depth, and integrated an improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We trained and tested the improved CNN and BiGRU, concatenated the outputs of the CNN and BiGRU modules, and passed them to the classification layer for recognition. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves an accuracy of 98.21% in identifying four types of rice diseases, providing a reliable method for rice disease recognition research.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Recommendations with minimum exposure guarantees: A post-processing

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Recommender systems; Fairness; Exposure; Integer linear programming
AB Relevance-based ranking is a popular ingredient in recommenders, but it frequently struggles to meet fairness criteria because social and cultural norms may favor some item groups over others. For instance, some items might receive lower ratings due to some sort of bias (e.g. gender bias). A fair ranking should balance the exposure of items from advantaged and disadvantaged groups. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing framework to produce fair, exposure-aware recommendations. Our approach is based on an integer linear programming model maximizing the expected utility while satisfying a minimum exposure constraint. The model has fewer variables than previous work and thus can be deployed to larger datasets and allows the organization to define a minimum level of exposure for groups of items. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation indicating that our new framework can increase the exposure of items from disadvantaged groups at a small cost of recommendation accuracy.

AB Modeling of physical processes as partial differential equations (PDEs) is often carried out with computationally expensive numerical solvers. A common, and important, process to model is that of laser interaction with biological tissues. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been used to model many physical processes, though none have demonstrated an approximation involving a source term in a PDE, which modeling laser-tissue interactions requires. In this work, a numerical solver for simulating tissue interactions with lasers was surrogated using PINNs while testing various boundary conditions, one with a radiative source term involved. Models were tested using differing activation function combinations in their architectures for comparison. The best combinations of activation functions were different for cases with and without a source term, and R2 scores and average relative errors for the predictions of the best PINN models indicate that it is an accurate surrogate model for corresponding solvers. PINNs appear to be valid replacements for numerical solvers for one-dimensional tissue interactions with electromagnetic radiation.

AB Using a safety belt is crucial for preventing severe injuries and fatalities during vehicle accidents. In this paper, we propose a real-time vehicle occupant safety belt detection system based on the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once version seven) object detection algorithm. The proposed approach aims to automatically detect whether the occupants of a vehicle have buckled their safety belts or not as soon as they are detected within the vehicle. A dataset for this purpose was collected and annotated for validation and testing. By leveraging the efficiency and accuracy of YOLOv7, we achieve near-instantaneous analysis of video streams, making our system suitable for deployment in various surveillance and automotive safety applications. This paper outlines a comprehensive methodology for training the YOLOv7 model using the labelImg tool to annotate the dataset with images showing vehicle occupants. It also discusses the challenges of detecting seat belts and evaluates the system's performance on a real-world dataset. The evaluation focuses on distinguishing the status of a safety belt between two classes: "buckled" and "unbuckled". The results demonstrate a high level of accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.6% and an F1 score of 98%, indicating the system's effectiveness in identifying the safety belt status.

AB The paper outlines an algorithm for the rapid aerodynamic evaluation of winglet geometries using the TORNADO Vortex Lattice Method. It is a very useful tool to obtain a first approximation of the aerodynamic properties and for performing an optimization of the geometry design. The TORNADO tool is used to systematically calculate the aerodynamic characteristics of various wings with wingtip devices. The fast response of the aerodynamic models allows obtaining a set of results in a remarkably short time. Therefore, the development of an algorithm to generate wing geometries with great ease and complex shapes is of vital importance for the mentioned optimization process. The basic outline of the algorithm, the equations defining the wing geometries, and the results for unconventional wingtip devices, such as blended winglets and spiroid winglets, are presented. Finally, this algorithm allows designing a procedure to study the improvement of aerodynamic properties (lift, induced drag, and moment). Some examples are included to illustrate the capabilities of the algorithm.

AB The Online Roadshow, a new type of web application, is a digital marketing approach that aims to maximize contactless business engagement. It leverages web computing to conduct interactive game sessions via the internet. As a result, massive amounts of personal data are generated during the engagement process between the audience and the Online Roadshow (e.g., gameplay data and clickstream information). The high volume of data collected is valuable for more effective market segmentation in strategic business planning through data-driven processes such as web personalization and trend evaluation. However, the data storage and processing techniques used in conventional data analytic approaches are typically overloaded in such a computing environment. Hence, this paper proposed a new big data processing framework to improve the processing, handling, and storing of these large amounts of data. The proposed framework aims to provide a better dual-mode solution for processing the generated data for the Online Roadshow engagement process in both historical and real-time scenarios. Multiple functional modules, such as the Application Controller, the Message Broker, the Data Processing Module, and the Data Storage Module, were reformulated to provide a more efficient solution that matches the new needs of the Online Roadshow data analytics procedures. Some tests were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed frameworks against existing similar frameworks and verify the performance of the proposed framework in fulfilling the data processing requirements of the Online Roadshow. The experimental results evidenced multiple advantages of the proposed framework for Online Roadshow compared to similar existing big data processing frameworks.

AB Due to its great efficiency, scalability, and inclusivity, distributed cooperative learning control has gotten a lot of attention. For complex uncertain multiagent systems, it is challenging to model the uncertainties and exploit the cooperative learning ability of the systems. To address these issues, we proposed a novel convex temporal convolutional network-based distributed cooperative learning control for uncertain discrete-time nonlinear multiagent systems. A new concept of using a convex temporal convolutional network (CTCNet) is proposed for estimating the uncertain agent dynamics in a cooperative way. Unlike previous methods that require adjustment of network weights for different control tasks, the proposed CTCNet can map the high-dimensional input-output space into a deep space spanned by basis features that represent the inherent properties of the system, so it has good robustness for different tasks. Consequently, to improve the control performance, a CTCNet-based distributed cooperative learning control method that shares learned knowledge through the communication topology among adaptive laws of CTCNet is proposed. Furthermore, the asymptotic convergence of system tracking errors to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin is strictly proved. Finally, the simulation results are given to illustrate that our suggested method has higher control accuracy, stronger robustness, and anti-interference ability than the existing methods.

AB Traditionally, neural networks are viewed from the perspective of connected neuron layers represented as matrix multiplications. We propose to compose these weight matrices from a set of orthogonal basis matrices by approaching them as elements of the real matrices vector space under addition and multiplication. Making use of the Kronecker product for vectors, this composition is unified with the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix. The orthogonal components of this SVD are trained with a descent curve on the Stiefel manifold using the Cayley transform. Next, update equations for the singular values and initialization routines are derived. Finally, acceleration for stochastic gradient descent optimization using this formulation is discussed. Our proposed method allows more parameter-efficient representations of weight matrices in neural networks. These decomposed weight matrices achieve maximal performance in both standard and more complicated neural architectures. Furthermore, the more parameter-efficient decomposed layers are shown to be less dependent on optimization and better conditioned. As a tradeoff, training time is increased up to a factor of 2. These observations are consequently attributed to the properties of the method and choice of optimization over the manifold of orthogonal matrices.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) form a critical infrastructure supporting various systems, spanning from the iPhone neural engine to imaging satellites and drones. The design of these neural cores is often proprietary or a military secret. Nevertheless, they remain vulnerable to model replication attacks that seek to reverse engineer the network's synaptic weights. In this article, we propose SCANet (Superparamagnetic-MTJ Crossbar Array Networks), a novel defense mechanism against such model stealing attacks by utilizing the innate stochasticity in superparamagnets. When used as the synapse in DNNs, superparamagnetic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJs) are shown to be significantly more secure than prior memristor-based solutions. The thermally induced telegraphic switching in the s-MTJs is robust and uncontrollable, thus thwarting the attackers from obtaining sensitive data from the network. Using a mixture of both superparamagnetic and conventional MTJs in the neural network (NN), the designer can optimize the time period between the weight updation and the power consumed by the system. Furthermore, we propose a modified NN architecture that can prevent replication attacks while minimizing power consumption. We investigate the effect of the number of layers in the deep network and the number of neurons in each layer on the sharpness of accuracy degradation when the network is under attack. We also explore the efficacy of SCANet in real-time scenarios, using a case study on object detection.

AB Polynomial expansions are important in the analysis of neural network nonlinearities. They have been applied thereto addressing well-known difficulties in verification, explainability, and security. Existing approaches span classical Taylor and Chebyshev methods, asymptotics, and many numerical approaches. We find that, while these have useful properties individually, such as exact error formulas, adjustable domain, and robustness to undefined derivatives, there are no approaches that provide a consistent method, yielding an expansion with all these properties. To address this, we develop an analytically modified integral transform expansion (AMITE), a novel expansion via integral transforms modified using derived criteria for convergence. We show the general expansion and then demonstrate an application for two popular activation functions: hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. Compared with existing expansions (i.e., Chebyshev, Taylor, and numerical) employed to this end, AMITE is the first to provide six previously mutually exclusive desired expansion properties, such as exact formulas for the coefficients and exact expansion errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMITE in two case studies. First, a multivariate polynomial form is efficiently extracted from a single hidden layer black-box multilayer perceptron (MLP) to facilitate equivalence testing from noisy stimulus-response pairs. Second, a variety of feedforward neural network (FFNN) architectures having between three and seven layers are range bounded using Taylor models improved by the AMITE polynomials and error formulas. AMITE presents a new dimension of expansion methods suitable for the analysis/approximation of nonlinearities in neural networks, opening new directions and opportunities for the theoretical analysis and systematic testing of neural networks.

   model compression; two-time-scale algorithms
AB Despite the many advantages of using deep neural networks over shallow networks in various machine learning tasks, their effectiveness is compromised in a federated learning setting due to large storage sizes and high computational resource requirements for training. A large model size can potentially require infeasible amounts of data to be transmitted between the server and clients for training. To address these issues, we investigate the traditional and novel compression techniques to construct sparse models from dense networks whose storage and bandwidth requirements are significantly lower. We do this by separately considering compression techniques for the server model to address downstream communication and the client models to address upstream communication. Both of these play a crucial role in developing and maintaining sparsity across communication cycles. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes by testing their performance on standard datasets and verify that they outperform various state-of-the-art baseline schemes in terms of accuracy and communication volume.

The distributed state predictor is designed based on the extended state system model, and the distributed state estimator is designed by using the measurement of the corresponding node. The prediction error and the estimation error are derived. The prediction error covariance (PEC) is obtained in terms of the recursive Riccati equation, and the upper bound of the PEC is minimized by designing an optimal estimator gain. With the vectorization approach, a sufficient condition concerning stability of the upper bound is developed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed extended state estimator.

   regularization (MIR); visual-attribute co-attention; zero-shot learning
   (ZSL)
AB Zero-shot image recognition aims to classify data from unseen classes, by exploring the association between visual features and the semantic representations of each class. Most existing approaches focus on learning a shared single-scale embedding space (often at the output layer of the network) for both visual and semantic features, ignoring a fact that different-scale visual features exhibit different semantics. In this article, we propose a multi-scale visual-attribute co-attention (mVACA) model, considering both visual-semantic alignment and visual discrimination at multiple scales. At each scale, a hybrid visual attention is realized by attribute-related attention and visual self-attention. The attribute-related attention is guided by a pseudo attribute vector inferred via a mutual information regularization (MIR). The visual self-attentive features further influence the attribute attention to emphasize visual-associated attributes. Leveraging multiscale visual discrimination, mVACA unifies standard zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalized ZSL tasks in one framework, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several commonly used benchmarks of both setups. To better understand the interaction between images and attributes in mVACA, we also provide visualized analysis.

Considering that the sensor signals and their interactions in an industrial process with the form of nodes and edges can be represented as a graph, this article proposes a novel interaction-aware and data fusion method for fault diagnosis of complex industrial processes, named interaction-aware graph neural networks (IAGNNs). First, to describe the complex interactions in an industrial process, the sensor signals are transformed into a heterogeneous graph with multiple edge types, and the edge weights are learned by the attention mechanism, adaptively. Then, multiple independent graph neural network (GNN) blocks are employed to extract the fault feature for each subgraph with one edge type. Finally, each subgraph feature is concatenated or fused by a weighted summation function to generate the final graph embedding. Therefore, the proposed method can learn multiple interactions between sensor signals and extract the fault feature from each subgraph by message passing operation of GNNs. The final fault feature contains the information from raw data and implicit interactions between sensor signals. The experimental results on the three-phase flow facility and power system (PS) demonstrate the reliable and superior performance of the proposed method for fault diagnosis of complex industrial processes.

AB Multitask learning (MTL) is a joint learning paradigm, which fuses multiple related tasks together to achieve the better performance than single-task learning methods. It has been observed by many researchers that different tasks with certain similarities share a low-dimensional common yet latent subspace. In order to get the low- rank structure shared across tasks, trace norm has been used as a convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem. However, trace norm is not a tight approximation for the rank function. To address this important issue, we propose two novel regularization-based models to approximate the rank minimization problem by minimizing the k minimal singular values. For our new models, if the minimal singular values are suppressed to zeros, the rank would also be reduced. Compared with the standard trace norm, our new regularization-based models are the tighter approximations, which can help our models capture the low-dimensional subspace among multiple tasks better. Besides, it is an NP-hard problem to directly solve the exact rank minimization problem for our models. In this article, we proposed two simple but effective strategies to optimize our models, which tactically solves the exact rank minimization problem by setting a large penalizing parameter. Experimental results performed on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed models have the ability of learning the low-rank structure shared across tasks and the better performance than other classical MTL methods.

AB Lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely heavily on the design of lightweight convolutional modules (LCMs). For an LCM, lightweight design based on repetitive feature maps (LoR) is currently one of the most effective approaches. An LoR mainly involves an extraction of feature maps from convolutional layers (CE) and feature map regeneration through cheap operations (RO). However, existing LoR approaches carry out lightweight improvements only from the aspect of RO but ignore the problems of poor generalization, low stability, and high computation workload incurred in the CE part. To alleviate these problems, this article introduces the concept of key features from a CNN model interpretation perspective. Subsequently, it presents a novel LCM, namely CEModule, focusing on the CE part. CEModule increases the number of key features to maintain a high level of accuracy in classification. In the meantime, CEModule employs a group convolution strategy to reduce floating-point operations (FLOPs) incurred in the training process. Finally, this article brings forth a dynamic adaptation algorithm a -DAM) to enhance the generalization of CEModule-enabled lightweight CNN models, including the developed CENet in dealing with datasets of different scales. Compared with the state-of-the-art results, CEModule reduces FLOPs by up to 54% on CIFAR-10 while maintaining a similar level of accuracy in classification. On ImageNet, CENet increases accuracy by 1.2% following the same FLOPs and training strategies.

AB Class imbalance is a common issue in the community of machine learning and data mining. The class-imbalance distribution can make most classical classification algorithms neglect the significance of the minority class and tend toward the majority class. In this article, we propose a label enhancement method to solve the class-imbalance problem in a graph manner, which estimates the numerical label and trains the inductive model simultaneously. It gives a new perspective on the class-imbalance learning based on the numerical label rather than the original logical label. We also present an iterative optimization algorithm and analyze the computation complexity and its convergence. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, several single-label and multilabel datasets are applied in the experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a promising performance and outperforms some state-of-the-art single-label and multilabel class-imbalance learning methods.

AB Accurate and practical load modeling plays a critical role in the power system studies including stability, control, and protection. Recently, wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs) are utilized to model the static and dynamic behavior of the load consumption pattern in real-time, simultaneously. In this article, a WAMS-based load modeling method is established based on a multi-residual deep learning structure. To do so, a comprehensive and efficient load model founded on combination of impedance-current-power and induction motor (IM) is constructed at the first step. Then, a deep learning-based framework is developed to understand the time-varying and complex behavior of the composite load model (CLM). To do so, a residual convolutional neural network (ResCNN) is developed to capture the spatial features of the load at different location of the large-scale power system. Then, gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to fully understand the temporal features from highly variant time-domain signals. It is essential to provide a balance between fast and slow variant parameters. Thus, the designed structure is implemented in a parallel manner to fulfill the balance and moreover, weighted fusion method is used to estimate the parameters, as well. Consequently, an error-based loss function is reformulated to improve the training process as well as robustness in the noisy conditions. The numerical experiments on IEEE 68-bus and Iranian 95-bus systems verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed load modeling approach. Furthermore, a comparative study with some relevant methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed structure. The obtained results in the worst-case scenario show error lower than 0.055% considering noisy condition and at least 50% improvement comparing the several state-of-art methods.

AB The tracking performance of discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) is often subject to unwanted boundary effects. Many attempts have already been made to address the above issue by enlarging searching regions over the last years. However, introducing excessive background information makes the discriminative filter prone to learn from the surrounding context rather than the target. In this article, we propose a novel context restrained correlation tracking filter (CRCTF) that can effectively suppress background interference via incorporating high-quality adversarial generative negative instances. Concretely, we first construct an adversarial context generation network to simulate the central target area with surrounding background information at the initial frame. Then, we suggest a coarse background estimation network to accelerate the background generation in subsequent frames. By introducing a suppression convolution term, we utilize generative background patches to reformulate the original ridge regression objective through circulant property of correlation and a cropping operator. Finally, our tracking filter is efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). CRCTF demonstrates the accuracy performance on par with several well-established and highly optimized baselines on multiple challenging tracking datasets, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB In the manufacturing process of aluminum alloy, the size, distribution, and shape of microscopic grains indicate the mechanical characteristics and product quality. However, for metallographic images that can reveal microstructures, the cost of expert labeling at pixel level is high. To solve the problem, we propose a semisupervised learning strategy for grain boundary detection with a few labeled images and abundant unlabeled samples. To expand the helpful information, transfer learning and rule-based region growing are considered. Specifically, a deep network used for extracting multiscale features is designed. With constant training, through a few labeled metallographic images and abundant transferred natural images, pseudo annotations are generated gradually for unlabeled metallographic images iteratively by feature similarity and boundary region growing. The increased unlabeled samples with their pseudo annotations would be involved in the following training process in semisupervised self-training mode to improve the generalization ability of model, together with the domain adaptation block. In experiments, the proposed two methods named semiricher convolutional features-generative adversarial networks (SemiRCF-GAN) and semiricher convolutional features-maximum mean discrepancy (SemiRCF-MMD) can effectively detect grain boundaries with only one labeled metallographic image, and achieve F1 scores of 0.73 and 0.72, respectively, which surpass typical methods.

AB Spiking neural P (SNP) systems are a class of neural-like computing models, abstracted by the mechanism of spiking neurons. This article proposes a new variant of SNP systems, called gated spiking neural P (GSNP) systems, which are composed of gated neurons. Two gated mechanisms are introduced in the nonlinear spiking mechanism of GSNP systems, consisting of a reset gate and a consumption gate. The two gates are used to control the updating of states in neurons. Based on gated neurons, a prediction model for time series is developed, known as the GSNP model. Several benchmark univariate and multivariate time series are used to evaluate the proposed GSNP model and to compare several state-of-the-art prediction models. The comparison results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of GSNP for time series forecasting.

AB In recent years, clustering methods based on deep generative models have received great attention in various unsupervised applications, due to their capabilities for learning promising latent embeddings from original data. This article proposes a novel clustering method based on variational autoencoder (VAE) with spherical latent embeddings. The merits of our clustering method can be summarized as follows. First, instead of considering the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the prior over latent space as in a variety of existing VAE-based deep clustering methods, the von Mises-Fisher mixture model prior is deployed in our method, leading to spherical latent embeddings that can explicitly control the balance between the capacity of decoder and the utilization of latent embedding in a principled way. Second, a dual VAE structure is leveraged to impose the reconstruction constraint for the latent embedding and its corresponding noise counterpart, which embeds the input data into a hyperspherical latent space for clustering. Third, an augmented loss function is proposed to enhance the robustness of our model, which results in a self-supervised manner through the mutual guidance between the original data and the augmented ones. The effectiveness of the proposed deep generative clustering method is validated through comparisons with state-of-the-art deep clustering methods on benchmark datasets. The source code of the proposed model is available at https://github.com/fwt-team/DSVAE.

AB This article presents a global adaptive neural-network-based control algorithm for disturbed pure-feedback nonlinear systems to achieve zero tracking error in a predefined time. Different from the traditional works that only solve the semiglobal bounded tracking problem for pure-feedback systems, this work not only achieves that the tracking error globally converges to zero but also guarantees that the convergence time can be predefined according to the user specification. In order to get the desired predefined-time controller, first, a mild semibound assumption for nonaffine functions is skillfully proposed so that the design difficulty caused by the structure of pure feedback can be easily solved. Then, we apply the property of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) and Young's inequality to derive the upper bound of the term that contains the unknown nonlinear function and external disturbances, and the designed adaptive parameters decide the derived upper and robust control gain. Finally, the predefined-time virtual control inputs are presented whose derivatives are further estimated by utilizing finite-time differentiators. It is strictly proved that the proposed novel predefined-time controller can guarantee that the tracking error globally converges to zero within predefined time and a practical example is shown to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed predefined-time control method.

AB Based on radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) and backstepping techniques, this brief considers the consensus tracking problem for nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multiagent systems with unknown states and disturbances. The adaptive event-triggered control scheme is introduced to decrease the update times of the controller so as to save the limited communication resources. To detect the unknown state, external disturbance, and reduce calculation workload, the state observer and disturbance observer as well as the first-order filter are first jointly constructed. It is shown that all the output signals of followers can uniformly track the reference signal of the leader and all the error signals are uniformly bounded. A simulation example is carried out to further prove the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Speech interaction is an important means of robot interaction. With the rapid development of deep learning, end-to-end speech synthesis methods based on this technique have gradually become mainstream. Chinese deep learning-based speech synthesis techniques suffer from problems such as unstable synthesised speech, poor naturalness and poor personalised speech synthesis, which do not satisfy some practical application scenarios. Hence, an F-MelGAN model is adopted to improve the performance of Chinese speech synthesis. A post-processing network is used to refine the Mel-spectrum predicted by the decoder and alleviate the Mel-spectrum distortion phenomenon. A phoneme-level and sentence-level combined module is proposed to model the personalised style of speakers. A combination of an acoustic conditioning network, speaker encoder network GCNet and feedback-constrained training is proposed to solve the problem of poor personalised speech synthesis and achieve personalised speech customisation in Chinese. Experimental results show that the whole model can generate high-quality speech with high speaker similarity for both speakers that appear in the training process and speakers that never appear in the training process.

AB The scores of distance-based outlier detection methods are difficult to interpret, and it is challenging to determine a suitable cut-off threshold between normal and outlier data points without additional context. We describe a generic transformation of distance-based outlier scores into interpretable, probabilistic estimates. The transformation is ranking-stable and increases the contrast between normal and outlier data points. Determining distance relationships between data points is necessary to identify the nearest-neighbor relationships in the data, yet most of the computed distances are typically discarded. We show that the distances to other data points can be used to model distance probability distributions and, subsequently, use the distributions to turn distance-based outlier scores into outlier probabilities. Over a variety of tabular and image benchmark datasets, we show that the probabilistic transformation does not impact outlier ranking (ROC AUC) or detection performance (AP, F1), and increases the contrast between normal and outlier score distributions (statistical distance). The experimental findings indicate that it is possible to transform distance-based outlier scores into interpretable probabilities with increased contrast between normal and outlier samples. Our work generalizes to a wide range of distance-based outlier detection methods, and, because existing distance computations are used, it adds no significant computational overhead.

AB Dimensionality reduction methods can be used to project high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space. If the output space is restricted to two dimensions, the result is a scatter plot whose goal is to present insightful visualizations of distance- and density-based structures. The topological invariance of dimension indicates that the two-dimensional similarities in the scatter plot cannot coercively represent high-dimensional distances. In praxis, projections of several datasets with distance- and density-based structures show a misleading interpretation of the underlying structures. The examples outline that the evaluation of projections remains essential. Here, 19 unsupervised quality measurements (QM) are grouped into semantic classes with the aid of graph theory. We use three representative benchmark datasets to show that QMs fail to evaluate the projections of straightforward structures when common methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation projection, or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied. This work shows that unsupervised QMs are biased towards assumed underlying structures. Based on insights gained from graph theory, we propose a new quality measurement called the Gabriel Classification Error (GCE). This work demonstrates that GCE can make an unbiased evaluation of projections. The GCE is accessible within the R package DR quality available on CRAN.

AB This article presents a comparative analysis of four low or no-code location-based game (LBG) authoring tools, namely Taleblazer, Aris, Actionbound, and Locatify. Each tool is examined in detail, with an emphasis on the functions and capabilities it provides for the development of LBGs. The article builds on the history and purpose of LBGs, their characteristics, as well as basic concepts and previous applications, placing emphasis both on the technological and pedagogical dimensions of these games. The evaluation of the tools is based on certain criteria, or metrics, recorded in the literature and empirical data collected through the development of prototype games for each tool. The tools are comparatively analyzed in terms of the LBG's constituent features they incorporate, the fundamental and additional functionality provided to the developer, as well as the existence or absence of features that captivate players in the game experience. Moreover, feedback is provided based on the practical use of the platforms for developing LBGs in order to support prospective developers in making an informed choice of an LBG platform for implementing a specific game. The games were created by taking advantage of as many features of the tools as possible in order to have a more fair and complete evaluation. This study aims to highlight the affordances and limitations of the investigated low or no-code LBG authoring tools, enabling anyone interested in developing an LBG to choose the most appropriate tool taking into account their needs and technological background or designing their own LBG authoring tools.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a critical role in the operation of robot vacuum cleaners, enabling them to intelligently navigate to clean and avoid indoor obstacles. Due to limited computational resources, manufacturers must balance performance and cost. This necessitates the development of lightweight AI models that can achieve high performance. Traditional uniform weight quantization assigns the same number of levels to all weights, regardless of their distribution or importance. Consequently, this lack of adaptability may lead to sub-optimal quantization results, as the quantization levels do not align with the statistical properties of the weights. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new technique called low bitwidth strong non-uniform quantization, which largely reduces the memory footprint of AI models while maintaining high accuracy. Our proposed non-uniform quantization method, as opposed to traditional uniform quantization, aims to align with the actual weight distribution of well-trained neural network models. The proposed quantization scheme builds upon the observation of weight distribution characteristics in AI models and aims to leverage this knowledge to enhance the efficiency of neural network implementations. Additionally, we adjust the input image size to reduce the computational and memory demands of AI models. The goal is to identify an appropriate image size and its corresponding AI models that can be used in resource-constrained robot vacuum cleaners while still achieving acceptable accuracy on the object classification task. Experimental results indicate that when compared to the state-of-the-art AI models in the literature, the proposed AI model achieves a 2-fold decrease in memory usage from 15.51 MB down to 7.68 MB while maintaining the same accuracy of around 93%. In addition, the proposed non-uniform quantization model reduces memory usage by 20 times (from 15.51 MB down to 0.78 MB) with a slight accuracy drop of 3.11% (the classification accuracy is still above 90%). Thus, our proposed high-performance and lightweight AI model strikes an excellent balance between model complexity, classification accuracy, and computational resources for robot vacuum cleaners.

   deep learning (DL); image classification
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited remarkable potential in effectively tackling the intricate task of classifying MRI images, specifically in Alzheimer's disease detection and brain tumor identification. While CNNs optimize their parameters automatically through training processes, finding the optimal values for these parameters can still be a challenging task due to the complexity of the search space and the potential for suboptimal results. Consequently, researchers often encounter difficulties determining the ideal parameter settings for CNNs. This challenge necessitates using trial-and-error methods or expert judgment, as the search for the best combination of parameters involves exploring a vast space of possibilities. Despite the automatic optimization during training, the process does not guarantee finding the globally-optimal parameter values. Hence, researchers often rely on iterative experimentation and expert knowledge to fine-tune these parameters and maximize CNN performance. This poses a significant obstacle in developing real-world applications that leverage CNNs for MRI image analysis. This paper presents a new hybrid model that combines the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with CNNs to enhance detection and classification capabilities. Our method utilizes the PSO algorithm to determine the optimal configuration of CNN hyper-parameters. Subsequently, these optimized parameters are applied to the CNN architectures for classification. As a result, our hybrid model exhibits improved prediction accuracy for brain diseases while reducing the loss of function value. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted experiments using three benchmark datasets. Two datasets were utilized for Alzheimer's disease: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and an international dataset from Kaggle. The third dataset focused on brain tumors. The experimental assessment demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model, achieving unprecedented accuracy rates of 98.50%, 98.83%, and 97.12% for the datasets mentioned earlier, respectively.

AB Deep learning (DL) algorithms can improve healthcare applications. DL has improved medical imaging diagnosis, therapy, and illness management. The use of deep learning algorithms on sensitive medical images presents privacy and data security problems. Improving medical imaging while protecting patient anonymity is difficult. Thus, privacy-preserving approaches for deep learning model training and inference are gaining popularity. These picture sequences are analyzed using state-of-the-art computer aided detection/diagnosis techniques (CAD). Algorithms that upload medical photos to servers pose privacy issues. This article presents a convolutional Bi-LSTM network to assess completely homomorphic-encrypted (HE) time-series medical images. From secret image sequences, convolutional blocks learn to extract selective spatial features and Bi-LSTM-based analytical sequence layers learn to encode time data. A weighted unit and sequence voting layer uses geographical with varying weights to boost efficiency and reduce incorrect diagnoses. Two rigid benchmarks-the CheXpert, and the BreaKHis public datasets-illustrate the framework's efficacy. The technique outperforms numerous rival methods with an accuracy above 0.99 for both datasets. These results demonstrate that the proposed outline can extract visual representations and sequential dynamics from encrypted medical picture sequences, protecting privacy while attaining good medical image analysis performance.

AB The automatic identification system (AIS) facilitates the monitoring of ship movements and provides essential input parameters for traffic safety. Previous studies have employed AIS data to detect behavioral anomalies and classify vessel types using supervised and unsupervised algorithms, including deep learning techniques. The approach proposed in this work focuses on the recognition of vessel types through the "Take One Class at a Time" (TOCAT) classification strategy. This approach pivots on a collection of adaptive models rather than a single intricate algorithm. Using radar data, these models are trained by taking into account aspects such as identifiers, position, velocity, and heading. However, it purposefully excludes positional data to counteract the inconsistencies stemming from route variations and irregular sampling frequencies. Using the given data, we achieved a mean accuracy of 83% on a 6-class classification task.

AB Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are effective tools for a variety of tasks that allow for the estimation of the uncertainty of the model. As BNNs use prior constraints on parameters, they are better regularized and less prone to overfitting, which is a serious issue for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where typically only small training datasets are available. Here, we tested, on the BCI Competition IV 2a motor imagery dataset, if the performance of the widely used, effective neural network classifiers EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet can be improved by turning them into BNNs. Accuracy indeed was higher, at least for a BNN based on Shallow ConvNet with two of three tested prior distributions. We also assessed if BNN-based uncertainty estimation could be used as a tool for out-of-domain (OOD) data detection. The OOD detection worked well only in certain participants; however, we expect that further development of the method may make it work sufficiently well for practical applications.

AB Flow-shop scheduling problems are classic examples of multi-resource and multi-operation scheduling problems where the objective is to minimize the makespan. Because of the high complexity and intractability of the problem, apart from some exceptional cases, there are no explicit algorithms for finding the optimal permutation in multi-machine environments. Therefore, different heuristic approaches, including evolutionary and memetic algorithms, are used to obtain the solution-or at least, a close enough approximation of the optimum. This paper proposes a novel approach: a novel combination of two rather efficient such heuristics, the discrete bacterial memetic evolutionary algorithm (DBMEA) proposed earlier by our group, and a conveniently modified heuristics, the Monte Carlo tree method. By their nested combination a new algorithm was obtained: the hybrid discrete bacterial memetic evolutionary algorithm (HDBMEA), which was extensively tested on the Taillard benchmark data set. Our results have been compared against all important other approaches published in the literature, and we found that this novel compound method produces good results overall and, in some cases, even better approximations of the optimum than any of the so far proposed solutions.

This paper describes a new numerical algorithm devoted to matrix logarithm computation and using the Romberg integration method, together with the inverse scaling and squaring technique. This novel method was implemented and compared with three different state-of-the-art codes, all based on Pade approximation. The experimental results, under a heterogeneous matrix test battery, showed that the new method was numerically stable, with an elapsed time midway among the other codes, and it generally offered a higher accuracy.

AB In order to develop machine learning and deep learning models that take into account the guidelines and principles of trustworthy AI, a novel information theoretic approach is introduced in this article. A unified approach to privacy-preserving interpretable and transferable learning is considered for studying and optimizing the trade-offs between the privacy, interpretability, and transferability aspects of trustworthy AI. A variational membership-mapping Bayesian model is used for the analytical approximation of the defined information theoretic measures for privacy leakage, interpretability, and transferability. The approach consists of approximating the information theoretic measures by maximizing a lower-bound using variational optimization. The approach is demonstrated through numerous experiments on benchmark datasets and a real-world biomedical application concerned with the detection of mental stress in individuals using heart rate variability analysis.

AB In this paper, a novel global optimization approach in the form of an adaptive hyper-heuristic, namely HyperDE, is proposed. As the naming suggests, the method is based on the Differential Evolution (DE) heuristic, which is a well-established optimization approach inspired by the theory of evolution. Additionally, two other similar approaches are introduced for comparison and validation, HyperSSA and HyperBES, based on Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Bald Eagle Search (BES), respectively. The method consists of a genetic algorithm that is adopted as a high-level online learning mechanism, in order to adjust the hyper-parameters and facilitate the collaboration of a homogeneous set of low-level heuristics with the intent of maximizing the performance of the search for global optima. Comparison with the heuristics that the proposed methodologies are based on, along with other state-of-the-art methods, is favorable.

AB Scene understanding is one of the most challenging areas of research in the fields of robotics and computer vision. Recognising indoor scenes is one of the research applications in the category of scene understanding that has gained attention in recent years. Recent developments in deep learning and transfer learning approaches have attracted huge attention in addressing this challenging area. In our work, we have proposed a fine-tuned deep transfer learning approach using DenseNet201 for feature extraction and a deep Liquid State Machine model as the classifier in order to develop a model for recognising and understanding indoor scenes. We have included fuzzy colour stacking techniques, colour-based segmentation, and an adaptive World Cup optimisation algorithm to improve the performance of our deep model. Our proposed model would dedicatedly assist the visually impaired and blind to navigate in the indoor environment and completely integrate into their day-to-day activities. Our proposed work was implemented on the NYU depth dataset and attained an accuracy of 96% for classifying the indoor scenes.

ID PREDICTION
AB Clinical decision-making in chronic disorder prognosis is often hampered by high variance, leading to uncertainty and negative outcomes, especially in cases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as valuable tools for reducing randomness and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, conventional methods for CKD detection often lack accuracy due to their reliance on limited sets of biological attributes. This research proposes a novel ML model for predicting CKD, incorporating various preprocessing steps, feature selection, a hyperparameter optimization technique, and ML algorithms. To address challenges in medical datasets, we employ iterative imputation for missing values and a novel sequential approach for data scaling, combining robust scaling, z-standardization, and min-max scaling. Feature selection is performed using the Boruta algorithm, and the model is developed using ML algorithms. The proposed model was validated on the UCI CKD dataset, achieving outstanding performance with 100% accuracy. Our approach, combining innovative preprocessing steps, the Boruta feature selection, and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, along with a hyperparameter optimization using grid-search cross-validation (CV), demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the early detection of CKD. This research highlights the potential of ML techniques in improving clinical support systems and reducing the impact of uncertainty in chronic disorder prognosis.

AB Recently, various methods to predict the future price of financial assets have emerged. One promising approach is to combine the historic price with sentiment scores derived via sentiment analysis techniques. In this article, we focus on predicting the future price of Bitcoin, which is currently the most popular cryptocurrency. More precisely, we propose a hybrid approach, combining time series forecasting and sentiment prediction from microblogs, to predict the intraday price of Bitcoin. Moreover, in addition to standard sentiment analysis methods, we are the first to employ a fine-tuned BERT model for this task. We also introduce a novel weighting scheme in which the weight of the sentiment of each tweet depends on the number of its creator's followers. For evaluation, we consider periods with strongly varying ranges of Bitcoin prices. This enables us to assess the models w.r.t. robustness and generalization to varied market conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that BERT-based sentiment analysis and the proposed weighting scheme improve upon previous methods. Specifically, our hybrid models that use linear regression as the underlying forecasting algorithm perform best in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE of 2.67) and root mean squared error (RMSE of 3.28). However, more complicated models, particularly long short-term memory networks and temporal convolutional networks, tend to have generalization and overfitting issues, resulting in considerably higher MAE and RMSE scores.

AB The process of building a Virtual Reality (VR) environment from images involves several steps: choose experimental conditions (scene, camera, trajectory, weather), take the images, reconstruct a textured 3D model thanks to a photogrammetry software, and import the 3D model into a game engine. This paper focuses on a postprocessing technique for the photogrammetry step, mostly for outdoor environments that cannot be reconstructed using an unmanned aerial vehicle. As visualization applications (including VR) need a 3D model with a known vertical direction, a method is introduced to compute it. The method is based on 3D principal component analysis and a 2D Hough transform. In the experiments, we first reconstruct both man-made and natural immersive environments using a helmet-held 360 camera, then we import the 3D models in good coordinate systems (i.e. with a vertical axis and a plausible scale) into Unity, and finally we use VR headsets to explore the scenes like a pedestrian. We also experiment on scanner data and show that our method is competitive with previous work.

AB The temperature field during laser welding process plays an important role on determining the quality and quantity of the weld bead size, microstructure characterizations and mechanical properties of the welding interface in the thermal engineering applications. In this study, using the numerical simulation, the influence of pulse duration and frequency on the temperature distribution and velocity field in distinctive laser welding of stainless steel 420 (S.S 420)/stainless steel 304 (S.S 304), and Bohler 303 (B 303)/stainless steel 304 (S.S 304) was examined. The results of numerical modeling illustrated that shear stress of Marangoni and buoyancy force are the most curtail aspects in the formation of the flow of liquid metal. A novel artificial intelligence method is proposed to optimally predict the melting ratio, and maximum temperature of the materials. To this end, a combination of ANN and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms are employed. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize the architecture and training algorithm of the ANN, while the ANN is employed for the regression problem. Based on the results, a three-layer feed-forward architecture with sigmoid transfer functions having 17 and 8 neurons in the hidden layers combined with the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation training scheme is recognized by the PSO as the optimal configuration. Application of optimal ANN to the regression problem results in an acceptable level of error for the training, validation, and test datasets. Finally, the optimized ANN can be utilized to anticipate the melting ratio and thereby the resultant temperature.

AB Traffic volume is a crucial information for many different fields, such as city planner, logistic planning and more. However, installing sensors on each road to collect traffic volume data for the whole traffic network is impractical due to high cost and human labour. Most recent studies implement machine learning, mathematical and statistical methods to learn the behaviour of traffic volume. However, the randomness of traffic volume can hardly be defined by equations or statistical models which leads to the proposed machine learning model. This paper proposed a novel spatial prediction to fill up the traffic volume of a whole network with an estimated 10% of ground truth data. To make up for the lack of data, a spatial-temporal weightage is assigned to each road before fitting the training sample into a tree ensemble model to perform a prediction of the connecting roads. The weightage is first computed using the 10% ground truth data and then the weightage is spread to connecting roads via an innovative repetitive breadth-first search (BFS) method that capture the spatial correlation of a traffic network. Various experiments were conducted to assess the significance of spatial weighting and it was observed that incorporating the weighting resulted in a 1.69% improvement in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The temporal relationship can be learnt from the trend of hourly traffic data for every day of the week. The proposed model achieved an average percentage error of 2.63% with reduced average percentage error by 95% compared to existing methods.

ID GRADE-POINT AVERAGE; WORK EXPERIENCE; PERCEPTIONS; FIT; INFORMATION
AB When job seekers are unsuccessful in getting a position, they often do not get feedback to inform them on how to develop a better application in the future. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand what qualifications recruiters value in order to help applicants. To address this need, we utilized eye-trackers to measure and record visual data of recruiters screening resumes to gain insight into which Areas of Interest (AOIs) influenced recruiters' decisions the most. Using just this eye-tracking data, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict whether or not a recruiter would move a resume on to the next level of the hiring process with an AUC of 0.767. We found that features associated with recruiters looking outside the content of a resume were most predictive of their decision as well as total time viewing the resume and time spent on the Experience and Education sections. We hypothesize that this behavior is indicative of the recruiter reflecting on the content of the resume. These initial results show that applicants should focus on designing clear and concise resumes that are easy for recruiters to absorb and think about, with additional attention given to the Experience and Education sections.

AB Clinical text often includes numbers of various types and formats. However, most current text classification approaches do not take advantage of these numbers. This study aims to demonstrate that using numbers as features can significantly improve the performance of text classification models. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting such features from clinical text. Unsupervised learning was used to identify patterns of number usage in clinical text. These patterns were analyzed manually and converted into pattern-matching rules. Information extraction was used to incorporate numbers as features into a document representation model. We evaluated text classification models trained on such representation. Our experiments were performed with two document representation models (vector space model and word embedding model) and two classification models (support vector machines and neural networks). The results showed that even a handful of numerical features can significantly improve text classification performance. We conclude that commonly used document representations do not represent numbers in a way that machine learning algorithms can effectively utilize them as features. Although we demonstrated that traditional information extraction can be effective in converting numbers into features, further community-wide research is required to systematically incorporate number representation into the word embedding process.

DE confidence calibration; top-label confidence calibration;

AB This paper investigates the post-hoc calibration of confidence for "exploratory" machine learning classification problems. The difficulty in these problems stems from the continuing desire to push the boundaries of which categories have enough examples to generalize from when curating datasets, and confusion regarding the validity of those categories. We argue that for such problems the "one-versus-all" approach (top-label calibration) must be used rather than the "calibrate-the-full-response-matrix" approach advocated elsewhere in the literature. We introduce and test four new algorithms designed to handle the idiosyncrasies of category-specific confidence estimation using only the test set and the final model. Chief among these methods is the use of kernel density ratios for confidence calibration including a novel algorithm for choosing the bandwidth. We test our claims and explore the limits of calibration on a bioinformatics application (PhANNs) as well as the classic MNIST benchmark. Finally, our analysis argues that post-hoc calibration should always be performed, may be performed using only the test dataset, and should be sanity-checked visually.

AB This paper presents a technique to reduce the number of parameters in a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture by incorporating autoencoders. To discover the optimal compression, we trained different autoencoders on the embedding space (encoder's output) of several pre-trained models. The experiments reveal that reducing the embedding size has the potential to dramatically decrease the GPU memory usage while speeding up the inference process. The proposed architecture was included in the BART model and tested for summarization, translation, and classification tasks. The summarization results show that a 60% decoder size reduction (from 96 M to 40 M parameters) will make the inference twice as fast and use less than half of GPU memory during fine-tuning process with only a 4.5% drop in R-1 score. The same trend is visible for translation and partially for classification tasks. Our approach reduces the GPU memory usage and processing time of large-scale sequence-to-sequence models for fine-tuning and inference. The implementation and checkpoints are available on GitHub.

DE autoencoders; neural networks; network intrusion detection
AB The proliferation of novel attacks and growing amounts of data has caused practitioners in the field of network intrusion detection to constantly work towards keeping up with this evolving adversarial landscape. Researchers have been seeking to harness deep learning techniques in efforts to detect zero-day attacks and allow network intrusion detection systems to more efficiently alert network operators. The technique outlined in this work uses a one-class training process to shape autoencoder feature residuals for the effective detection of network attacks. Compared to an original set of input features, we show that autoencoder feature residuals are a suitable replacement, and often perform at least as well as the original feature set. This quality allows autoencoder feature residuals to prevent the need for extensive feature engineering without reducing classification performance. Additionally, it is found that without generating new data compared to an original feature set, using autoencoder feature residuals often improves classifier performance. Practical side effects from using autoencoder feature residuals emerge by analyzing the potential data compression benefits they provide.

AB Massive text collections are the backbone of large language models, the main ingredient of the current significant progress in artificial intelligence. However, as these collections are mostly collected using automatic methods, researchers have few insights into what types of texts they consist of. Automatic genre identification is a text classification task that enriches texts with genre labels, such as promotional and legal, providing meaningful insights into the composition of these large text collections. In this paper, we evaluate machine learning approaches for the genre identification task based on their generalizability across different datasets to assess which model is the most suitable for the downstream task of enriching large web corpora with genre information. We train and test multiple fine-tuned BERT-like Transformer-based models and show that merging different genre-annotated datasets yields superior results. Moreover, we explore the zero-shot capabilities of large GPT Transformer models in this task and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the zero-shot approach. We also publish the best-performing fine-tuned model that enables automatic genre annotation in multiple languages. In addition, to promote further research in this area, we plan to share, upon request, a new benchmark for automatic genre annotation, ensuring the non-exposure of the latest large language models.

AB The contemporary geopolitical environment and strategic uncertainty shaped by asymmetric and hybrid threats urge the future development of hands-on training in realistic environments. Training in immersive, virtual environments is a promising approach. Immersive training can support training for contexts that are otherwise hard to access, dangerous, or have high costs. This paper discusses the challenges for virtual reality training in the CBRN (chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear) domain. Based on initial considerations and a literature review, we conducted a survey and three workshops to gather requirements for CBRN training in virtual environments. We structured the gathered insights into four overarching themes-the future of CBRN training, ethical and safety requirements, evaluation and feedback, and tangible objects and tools. We provide insights on these four themes and discuss recommendations.

AB Augmented reality offers many artistic possibilities when it comes to the creation of place-based public artworks. In this paper, we present a series of works around the topic of augmented reality (AR) art and place-based storytelling, including the use of walking as a creative method, a series of workshops with emerging artists, public AR art collaborations and a study to examine user experience when interacting with such artworks. Our findings from these works show the potential of integrating augmented reality with public physical artworks and offer guidance to artists and AR developers on how to expand this potential. For artists, we show the importance of the space in which the artwork will be placed and provide guidance on how to work with the space. For developers, we find that there is a need to create tools that work with artists' existing practices and to investigate how to expand augmented reality past the limitations of site- or piece-specific apps.

It is a common practice to improve the optimization algorithm's robustness to noise, since this algorithm is ultimately in charge of updating the network parameters. Previous studies revealed that the first-order moment used in Adam-like stochastic gradient descent optimizers can be modified based on the Student's t-distribution. While this modification led to noise-resistant updates, the other associated statistics remained unchanged, resulting in inconsistencies in the assumed models. In this paper, we propose AdaTerm, a novel approach that incorporates the Student's t-distribution to derive not only the first-order moment but also all the associated statistics. This provides a unified treatment of the optimization process, offering a comprehensive framework under the statistical model of the t-distribution for the first time. The proposed approach offers several advantages over previously proposed approaches, including reduced hyperparameters and improved robustness and adaptability. AdaTerm achieves this by considering the interdependence of gradient dimensions. In particular, upon detection, AdaTerm excludes aberrant gradients from the update process and enhances its robustness for subsequent updates. Conversely, it performs normal parameter updates when the gradients are statistically valid, allowing for flexibility in adapting its robustness. This noise-adaptive behavior contributes to AdaTerm's exceptional learning performance, as demonstrated through various optimization problems with different and/or unknown noise ratios. Furthermore, we introduce a new technique for deriving a theoretical regret bound without relying on AMSGrad, providing a valuable contribution to the field.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) can be considered a probabilistic model, wherein the output is a random variable characterized by its mean and variance, both crucial for assessing and enhancing ELM's generalization ability. Despite its importance, limited research has been conducted on quantitative variance estimation and the underlying factors that influence connecting weight regularization. In this paper, we establish a connection between the variance and weights of ELM for regression problems, and propose maximum likelihood-based estimations for model parameters. We introduce a novel activation function and algorithms to generate hidden layer outputs and predicted outputs that adhere or approximate a normal distribution, as validated through experiments. Additionally, by leveraging the established relationship, we derive estimators for weights, variance, and confidence intervals of predicted values using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The variance estimator enables a quantitative evaluation of generalization, and the link between variance and weights offers a theoretical basis for ELM regularization techniques.

ID SPATIOTEMPORAL ATTENTION NETWORKS
AB Recognition of human actions is to classify actions in a video. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has been applied to action recognition. However, the Vision Transformer is unsuitable for high-resolution input videos due to the constraint of computing power since ViT splits frames into fixed-size patches embedded (i.e., tokens) with absolute-position information and adopts a pure Transformer encoder to model the relationships among these tokens. To address this issue, we propose a relative position embedding based spatially and temporally decoupled Transformer (RPE-STDT) for action recognition, which can capture spatial-temporal information by stacked self-attention layers. The proposed RPE-STDT model consists of two separate series of Transformer encoders. The first series of encoders is the spatial Transformer encoders, which model interactions between tokens extracted from the same temporal index. The second series of encoders is the temporal Transformer encoders, which model interactions across time dimensions with a subsampling strategy. Furthermore, we replace the absolute-position embeddings in the Vision Transformer encoders with the proposed relative -position embeddings to capture the order of the embedded tokens to reduce computational costs. Finally, we conduct thorough ablation studies. Our RPE-STDT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple action recognition datasets, exceeding prior convolution and Transformer-based networks.

AB Perhaps one of the best-known machine learning models is the artificial neural network, where a number of parameters must be adjusted to learn a wide range of practical problems from areas such as physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. Such problems can be reduced to pattern recognition problems and then modeled from artificial neural networks, whether these problems are classification problems or regression problems. To achieve the goal of neural networks, they must be trained by appropriately adjusting their parameters using some global optimization methods. In this work, the application of a recent global minimization technique is suggested for the adjustment of neural network parameters. In this technique, an approximation of the objective function to be minimized is created using artificial neural networks and then sampling is performed from the approximation function and not the original one. Therefore, in the present work, learning of the parameters of artificial neural networks is performed using other neural networks. The new training method was tested on a series of well-known problems, a comparative study was conducted against other neural network parameter tuning techniques, and the results were more than promising. From what was seen after performing the experiments and comparing the proposed technique with others that have been used for classification datasets as well as regression datasets, there was a significant difference in the performance of the proposed technique, starting with 30% for classification datasets and reaching 50% for regression problems. However, the proposed technique, because it presupposes the use of global optimization techniques involving artificial neural networks, may require significantly higher execution time than other techniques.

AB Chatbots are programs with the ability to understand and respond to natural language in a way that is both informative and engaging. This study explored the current trends of using transformers and transfer learning techniques on Arabic chatbots. The proposed methods used various transformers and semantic embedding models from AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, AraElectra-SQuAD, and AraElectra (Generator/Discriminator). Two datasets were used for the evaluation: one with 398 questions, and the other with 1395 questions and 365,568 documents sourced from Arabic Wikipedia. Extensive experimental works were conducted, evaluating both manually crafted questions and the entire set of questions by using confidence and similarity metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that combining the power of transformer architecture with extractive chatbots can provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to questions in Arabic. Specifically, our experimental results showed that the AraElectra-SQuAD model consistently outperformed other models. It achieved an average confidence score of 0.6422 and an average similarity score of 0.9773 on the first dataset, and an average confidence score of 0.6658 and similarity score of 0.9660 on the second dataset. The study concludes that the AraElectra-SQuAD showed remarkable performance, high confidence, and robustness, which highlights its potential for practical applications in natural language processing tasks for Arabic chatbots. The study suggests that the language transformers can be further enhanced and used for various tasks, such as specialized chatbots, virtual assistants, and information retrieval systems for Arabic-speaking users.

AB This paper establishes a novel fractional-order version of a recently expanded form of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovery (SEIR) Mpox model. This model is investigated by means of demonstrating some significant findings connected with the stability analysis and the vaccination impact, as well. In particular, we analyze the fractional-order Mpox model in terms of its invariant region, boundedness of solution, equilibria, basic reproductive number, and its elasticity. In accordance with an effective vaccine, we study the progression and dynamics of the Mpox disease in compliance with various scenarios of the vaccination ratio through the proposed fractional-order Mpox model. Accordingly, several numerical findings of the proposed model are depicted with the use of two numerical methods; the Fractional Euler Method (FEM) and Modified Fractional Euler Method (MFEM). Such findings demonstrate the influence of the fractional-order values coupled with the vaccination rate on the dynamics of the established disease model.

   recognition; transformer architecture; weight magnitude
AB Transformer models are being increasingly used in end-to-end speech recognition systems for their performance. However, their substantial size poses challenges for deploying them in real-world applications. These models heavily rely on attention and feedforward layers, with the latter containing a vast number of parameters that significantly contribute to the model's memory footprint. Consequently, it becomes pertinent to consider pruning these layers to reduce the model's size. In this article, our primary focus is on the feedforward layers. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of their parameter count and distribution. Specifically, we examine the weight distribution within each layer and observe how the weight values progress across the transformer model's blocks. Our findings demonstrate a correlation between the depth of the feedforward layers and the magnitude of their weights. Consequently, layers with higher weight values require less pruning. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel pruning algorithm based on variable rates. This approach sets the pruning rate according to the significance and location of each feedforward layer within the network. To evaluate our new pruning method, we conduct experiments on various datasets. The results reveal its superiority over conventional pruning techniques, such as local pruning and global pruning.

AB Stroke is a major public health issue with significant economic consequences. This study aims to enhance stroke prediction by addressing imbalanced datasets and algorithmic bias. Our research focuses on accurately and precisely detecting stroke possibility to aid prevention. We tackle the overlooked aspect of imbalanced datasets in the healthcare literature. Our study focuses on predicting stroke in a general context rather than specific subtypes. This clarification will not only ensure a clear understanding of our study's scope but also enhance the overall transparency and impact of our findings. We construct an optimization model and describe an effective methodology and algorithms for machine learning classification, accommodating missing data and imbalances. Our models outperform previous efforts in stroke prediction, demonstrating higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. Data quality and preprocessing play a crucial role in developing reliable models. The proposed algorithm using SVMs achieves 98% accuracy and 97% recall score. In-depth data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques improve stroke prediction. This research highlights the value of data-oriented approaches, leading to enhanced accuracy and understanding of stroke risk factors. These methods can be applied to other medical domains, benefiting patient care and public health outcomes. By incorporating our findings, the efficiency and effectiveness of the public health system can be improved.

AB In this paper, a new nonsmooth optimization-based algorithm for solving large-scale regression problems is introduced. The regression problem is modeled as fully-connected feedforward neural networks with one hidden layer, piecewise linear activation, and the L1-loss functions. A modified version of the limited memory bundle method is applied to minimize this nonsmooth objective. In addition, a novel constructive approach for automated determination of the proper number of hidden nodes is developed. Finally, large real-world data sets are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm and to compare it with some state-of-the-art neural network algorithms for regression. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm as a predictive tool in most data sets used in numerical experiments.

AB The use of simulation and reinforcement learning can be viewed as a flexible approach to aid managerial decision-making, particularly in the face of growing complexity in manufacturing and logistic systems. Efficient supply chains heavily rely on steamlined warehouse operations, and therefore, having a well-informed storage location assignment policy is crucial for their improvement. The traditional methods found in the literature for tackling the storage location assignment problem have certain drawbacks, including the omission of stochastic process variability or the neglect of interaction between various warehouse workers. In this context, we explore the possibilities of combining simulation with reinforcement learning to develop effective mechanisms that allow for the quick acquisition of information about a complex environment, the processing of that information, and then the decision-making about the best storage location assignment. In order to test these concepts, we will make use of the FlexSim commercial simulator.

AB This paper presents the development of a robust control algorithm to be applied in a knee and ankle joint exoskeleton designed for rehabilitation of flexion/extension movements. The goal of the control law is to follow the trajectory of a straight leg extension routine in a sitting position. This routine is commonly used to rehabilitate an injury on an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and it is applied to the knee and ankle joints. Moreover, the paper presents the development and implementation of the robotic structure of the ankle joint to integrate it into an exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation. The development of the dynamic model and the implementation of the control algorithm in simulation and experimental tests are presented, showing that the proposed control guarantees the convergence of the tracking error.

AB Timely information about the need to thin forests is vital in forest management to maintain a healthy forest while maximizing income. Currently, very-high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data can provide crucial assistance to experts when evaluating the maturity of thinnings. Nevertheless, this task is still predominantly carried out in the field and demands extensive resources. This paper presents a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect the necessity and urgency of carrying out thinnings using only remote sensing data. The approach uses very-high-spatial-resolution RGB and near-infrared orthophotos; a canopy height model (CHM); a digital terrain model (DTM); the slope; and reference data, which, in this case, originate from spruce-dominated forests in the Austrian Alps. After tuning, the model achieves an F1 score of 82.23% on our test data, which indicates that the model is usable in a practical setting. We conclude that DCNNs are capable of detecting the need to carry out thinnings in forests. In contrast, attempts to assess the urgency of the need for thinnings with DCNNs proved to be unsuccessful. However, additional data, such as age or yield class, have the potential to improve the results. Our investigation into the influence of each individual input feature shows that orthophotos appear to contain the most relevant information for detecting the need for thinning. Moreover, we observe a gain in performance when adding the CHM and slope, whereas adding the DTM harms the model's performance.

AB Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems are commonly utilized in mobile electric drive systems due to their high efficiency, high power density, and low maintenance cost. To reduce the tracking error of the permanent magnet synchronous motor, a reinforcement learning (RL) control algorithm based on double delay deterministic gradient algorithm (TD3) is proposed. The physical modeling of PMSM is carried out in Simulink, and the current controller controlling id-axis and iq-axis in the current loop is replaced by a reinforcement learning controller. The optimal control network parameters were obtained through simulation learning, and DDPG, BP, and LQG algorithms were simulated and compared under the same conditions. In the experiment part, the trained RL network was compiled into C code according to the workflow with the help of rapid prototyping control, and then downloaded to the controller for testing. The measured output signal is consistent with the simulation results, which shows that the algorithm can significantly reduce the tracking error under the variable speed of the motor, making the system have a fast response.

AB In industrial processes, the ability to predict future steps is essential as it offers long-term insights, benefiting strategic decision-making. However, traditional sequence-to-sequence models designed to predict dynamic behaviors suffer from accumulating errors during recurrent predictions which use previous outputs as inputs for the next time step. In this article, we propose a dual attention-based encoder-decoder framework, specifically designed to enhance multi-step ahead predictions in industrial processes. The dual attention model strategically minimizes the error accumulation of output sequence by leveraging a temporal attention mechanism, which focuses on relevant time-steps in the input sequence, and a supervised attention mechanism that assigns different weights to output sequence errors during training. The supervised attention method, in particular, provides a significant improvement by focusing on minimizing the error of earlier steps during backpropagation using predefined attention weights, resulting in enhanced overall multistep prediction performance. Experi-ments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models, specifically simple sequence-to-sequence and single attention-based sequence-to-sequence models. In fact, our dual attention framework consistently surpasses single attention models, currently regarded as state-of-the-art, at all prediction stages. The suggested approach has potential applications in the field of process monitoring and model predictive control.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep learning and computer vision techniques have gained significant attention in the agriculture sector due to their non-destructive and contactless features. These techniques are also being integrated into modern farming systems, such as aquaponics, to address the challenges hindering its commercialization and large-scale implementation. Aquaponics is a farming technology that combines a recirculating aquaculture system and soilless hydroponics agriculture, that promises to address food security issues. To complement the current research efforts, a methodology is proposed to automatically measure the morphological traits of crops such as width, length and area and estimate the effective plant spacing between grow channels. Plant spacing is one of the key design parameters that are dependent on crop type and its morphological traits and hence needs to be monitored to ensure high crop yield and quality which can be impacted due to foliage occlusion or overlapping as the crop grows. The proposed approach uses Mask-RCNN to estimate the size of the crops and a mathematical model to determine plant spacing for a self-adaptive aquaponics farm. For common little gem romaine lettuce, the growth is estimated within 2 cm of error for both length and width. The final model is deployed on a cloud-based application and integrated with an ontology model containing domain knowledge of the aquaponics system. The relevant knowledge about crop characteristics and optimal plant spacing is extracted from ontology and compared with results obtained from the final model to suggest further actions. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can pave the way for intelligent system monitoring and control.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Improved disease prediction accuracy and reliability are the main concerns in the development of models for the medical field. This study examined methods for increasing classification accuracy and proposed a precise and reliable framework for categorizing breast cancers using mammography scans. Concatenated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were developed based on three models: Two by transfer learning and one entirely from scratch. Misclassification of lesions from mammography images can also be reduced using this approach. Bayesian optimization performs hyperparameter tuning of the layers, and data augmentation will refine the model by using more training samples. Analysis of the model's accuracy revealed that it can accurately predict disease with 97.26% accuracy in binary cases and 99.13% accuracy in multi-classification cases. These findings are in contrast with recent studies on the same issue using the same dataset and demonstrated a 16% increase in multi-classification accuracy. In addition, an accuracy improvement of 6.4% was achieved after hyperparameter modification and augmentation. Thus, the model tested in this study was deemed superior to those presented in the extant literature. Hence, the concatenation of three different CNNs from scratch and transfer learning allows the extraction of distinct and significant features without leaving them out, enabling the model to make exact diagnoses.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB Social Media Analytics (SMA) is more and more relevant in today's market dynamics. However, it is necessary to use it wisely, either in promoting any kind of product/brand, or interacting with customers. This requires its effective understanding and monitoring. One way is through web data scraping (WDS) tools that allow to select sites and platforms to compare them in their performances. They can optimize extraction of big data published on social media. Due to current challenges, a sector that can particularly take advantage of this source is tourism (and its related sectors). This year has the hope of tourism's revival after a pandemic whose impacts are still affecting several activities. Many traders and entrepreneurs have already used these versatile tools. However, do they really know their potential? The present study highlights the use of WDS to collect data from TripAdvisor's social pages. Besides comparing competitors' performance, companies also gain new knowledge of unnoticed preferences/habits. This contributes to more interesting innovations and results for them and for their customers. The approach used here is based on a project for smart tourism consultancy, from the identification of a gap in our region, to aid tourism organizations to enhance their digital presence and business model. Many things can be detected in this big source of unstructured data very quickly and easily without programming. Moreover, exploring code, either to refine the web scraper or connect it with other platforms/apps, can be an object of future research to leverage consumer behavior prediction for more advanced interactions.

AB The development of process-driven systems and the advancements in digital twins have led to the birth of new ways of monitoring and analyzing systems, i.e., digital process twins. Specifically, a digital process twin can allow the monitoring of system behavior and the analysis of the execution status to improve the whole system. However, the concept of the digital process twin is still theoretical, and process-driven systems cannot really benefit from them. In this regard, this work discusses how to effectively exploit a digital process twin and proposes an implementation that combines the monitoring, refinement, and enactment of system behavior. We demonstrated the proposed solution in a multi-robot scenario.

AB The accelerating pace of application development requires more frequent database switching, as technological advancements demand agile adaptation. The increase in the volume of data and at the same time, the number of transactions has determined that some applications migrate from one database to another, especially from a relational database to a non-relational (NoSQL) alternative. In this transition phase, the coexistence of both databases becomes necessary. In addition, certain users choose to keep both databases permanently updated to exploit the individual strengths of each database in order to streamline operations. Existing solutions mainly focus on replication, failing to adequately address the management of synchronization between a relational and a non-relational (NoSQL) database. This paper proposes a practical IT approach to this problem and tests the feasibility of the proposed solution by developing an application that maintains the synchronization between a MySQL database as a relational database and MongoDB as a non-relational database. The performance and capabilities of the solution are analyzed to ensure data consistency and correctness. In addition, problems that arose during the development of the application are highlighted and solutions are proposed to solve them.

AB Plant taxonomy is the scientific study of the classification and naming of various plant species. It is a branch of biology that aims to categorize and organize the diverse variety of plant life on earth. Traditionally, plant taxonomy has been performed using morphological and anatomical characteristics, such as leaf shape, flower structure, and seed and fruit characters. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and especially deep learning can also play an instrumental role in plant taxonomy by automating the process of categorizing plant species based on the available features. This study investigated transfer learning techniques to analyze images of plants and extract features that can be used to cluster the species hierarchically using the k-means clustering algorithm. Several pretrained deep learning models were employed and evaluated. In this regard, two separate datasets were used in the study comprising of seed images of wild plants collected from Egypt. Extensive experiments using the transfer learning method (DenseNet201) demonstrated that the proposed methods achieved superior accuracy compared to traditional methods with the highest accuracy of 93% and F1-score and area under the curve (AUC) of 95%, respectively. That is considerable in contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.

AB YouTube is a popular video-sharing platform that offers a diverse range of content. Assessing the quality of a video without watching it poses a significant challenge, especially considering the recent removal of the dislike count feature on YouTube. Although comments have the potential to provide insights into video content quality, navigating through the comments section can be time-consuming and overwhelming work for both content creators and viewers. This paper proposes an NLP-based model to classify Arabic comments as positive or negative. It was trained on a novel dataset of 4212 labeled comments, with a Kappa score of 0.818. The model uses six classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. It achieved 94.62% accuracy and an MCC score of 91.46% with NB. Precision, Recall, and F1-measure for NB were 94.64%, 94.64%, and 94.62%, respectively. The Decision Tree had a suboptimal performance with 84.10% accuracy and an MCC score of 69.64% without TF-IDF. This study provides valuable insights for content creators to improve their content and audience engagement by analyzing viewers' sentiments toward the videos. Furthermore, it bridges a literature gap by offering a comprehensive approach to Arabic sentiment analysis, which is currently limited in the field.

ID H-INFINITY CONTROL; STABILITY ANALYSIS; DESIGN
AB Choosing adequate sampling frequencies in sensors has a considerably positive impact on the two time scale fuzzy logic controller design. Motivated by this concept, this article addresses the fuzzy-parallel distribution compensation (PDC)-based control synthesis for a singularly perturbed nonlinear systems (SPNS) under a nonperiodic multirate sampling mechanism, which also provides guidance on the reasonable choice of maximum allowable sampling time intervals (MASTIs) for multirate sensors. First, the sampled SPNS is converted into a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy singularly perturbed model (TSFSPM) with slow and fast time-varying delays. Then, an c-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of order n is proposed to derive the sufficient conditions for stabilizing a multirate sampled TSFSPM under a two time scale PDC control. Given the slow MASTI, an efficient linear-matrix inequality-based design is proposed to recast the e-dependent stabilization conditions as a set of e-independent linear matrix inequalities that are easily solved. On this basis, the upper bound of singular perturbation parameter e, i.e., e(*), should be determined to compute the fast MASTI for the possibly slow sampling of fast states. The optimal match of (e(*), n) is detected for a tradeoff among the closed-loop stability, the controller performance, and the sensor cost. The superiority of the obtained results is shown in an example of a flexible joint inverted pendulum system.

AB Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a kind of classic cluster method, which has been widely used in various fields, such as image segmentation and data mining. Euclidean distance is a frequently used distance metric in FCM, but it is only suitable for data with spherical structure. As an extension of Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance has been used in Gustafson-Kessel FCM and its variants to tackle ellipsoidal data. For the convenience of optimizing, most existing Mahalanobis distance-based FCM algorithms only focus on squaredMahalanobis distance. However, squaredMahalanobis distance may not be the best distance metric for FCMbecause it is easy to enlarge the influence of outliers. In this article, we propose a novel l(2),(p) -norm and Mahalanobis distancebased FCMmodel, abbreviated as LM-FCM, which can help FCM improve the ability of tackling ellipsoidal clusters and outliers. Then, in order to reduce computational complexity, we propose amore simplified model, abbreviated as SLM-FCM. Furthermore, we develop an iteratively reweighted optimization algorithm to optimize the proposed models and provide a rigorous monotonous convergence proof. Finally, compared with the existing state-ofthe-art FCM algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to manifest the superior clustering performance and robustness of the proposed algorithms.

AB This article investigates the event-triggered optimized tracking control problem for stochastic nonlinear systems based on reinforcement learning (RL). By using the backstepping strategy, an adaptive RL algorithm is performed under the identifier-critic-actor architecture to achieve event-triggered optimized control (ETOC). Moreover, a novel dynamically adjustable event-triggered mechanism is delicately designed, which adjusts the triggering threshold online to economize communication resources and reduce the computation burden. To overcome the difficulty that the virtual control signals are discontinuous due to the state-triggering, the virtual controllers are designed with the continuous sampling states signals, and the actual optimal controller is redesigned by using the triggered states in the last step. Furthermore, the proposed ETOC in this article has significant advantages in terms of saving network resources because the event-triggered mechanism is employed in the sensor-to-controller channel and the event-sampled states are utilized to directly activate the control actions. Finally, it can be guaranteed that all signals of the stochastic system are bounded under the presented ETOC method. A simulation example is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ETOC algorithm.

AB This article focuses on a new outlier-resistant non -fragile control issue for a class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy delayed neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms. Compared with the existing delayed neural networks, fuzzy control rules and reaction- diffusion phenomenon are considered simultaneously, which makes the proposed models more practical. Furthermore, when subjected to abnormal interference, measurement outputs result in measurement outliers. In order to mitigate the negative effects on the estimation error, a state estimator scheme is presented by introducing a saturation function. By using an appropriate Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional and with the help of a free-weighting matrix, sufficient conditions can be deduced to guarantee the asymptotical stability and prescribed H-8 performance index of the disturbance attenuation of the estimation error. Next, a design strategy of an outlier-resistant nonfragile state estimator is put forward by employing some decoupling techniques. An illustrative example is exploited to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed state estimator. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are applied to image encryption. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the presented encryption scheme is feasible and effective.

TI Security Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control Under Multistrategy

AB This article considers the security sliding mode control problem for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems, where the sensor-controller channel may be subject to the false data injection (FDI) attack with a multistrategy attack model. The different attack patterns at each instant are described via a random categorical distribution. It is noted that the injected false data may result in the system state to exceed the modeling domain. In order to handle the above phenomenon, a reconstruction method of the controller's membership functions (MFs) is proposed via analyzing the variation range of the attacked state, and then, a feasible IT2 fuzzy sliding mode security controller is designed. The explicit relation between the raw state signal and attacked state is established, based on which stability conditions dependent on the regional boundaries of MFs are obtained for the input-to-state stability in probability of the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, a framework of security performance optimization is established via searching a desirable sliding matrix, which may be solved via the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed security control scheme is extended to imperfectly matched MFs case, where the controller does not demand the same fuzzy rules as the controlled fuzzy system. Finally, the simulation verification is carried out via numerical and practical examples.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; DESIGN
AB The integrated fault estimation and fault-tolerant control scheme is developed in this article for a series of interval type-2 polynomial fuzzy systems with both sensor faults and actuator faults, where the bidirectional influence between fault estimation unit and fault-tolerant control unit is investigated. Considering the existence of sensor faults, unmeasurable premise variables are investigated for more general situations and Class III state/fault estimation observers are established for the final fault estimation and fault-tolerant control purposes. To increase design flexibility and reduce physical implementation complexity, the proposed method allows the observer and original system to share asynchronous membership functions and a different number of fuzzy rules. (Q,S,R}- a dissipative performance index is also introduced to fulfill a wider vary of performance requirements. Membership function-dependent stability constraints are given in the format of bilinear polynomial matrix inequalities to obtain less conservative results, which are computed by a two-step path-following method. Superiority and validity are demonstrated by an inverted pendulum example in terms of estimation errors, fault-tolerant control performance, and control inputs.

AB This article studies the admissibility stability issue of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy singular (TFS) systems with time-varying delay. First, negative-definiteness constraints for nth-order matrix valued polynomials are established based on the Finsler's Lemma. A new reciprocally convex inequality (RCI) is developed according to the proposed negative-definiteness method. Then, an improved state decomposition Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional is constructed based on the decomposed state method. The improved L-K functional is augmented by considering more information on TFS system states and the delay-dependent matrix. Based on the novel RCI and the L-K functional, a less conservative admissibility criterion is derived. Finally, a well-studied numerical example is performed to reveal the superiority and validity of the proposed admissibility criteria.

AB The main goal of most information quality (IQ)-based measures is to combine data provided by multiple information sources to enhance the quality of information essential for decision makers to perform their tasks. However, there is few work to fuse multisource information from the perspective of possibility distribution (PD) and use IQ as the evaluation criteria for feature selection. The PD is one of important concepts in the possibility theory, which is a generally acknowledged method for describing a kind of uncertain knowledge. In this article, we propose a novel representation model of PDs based on FMs, namely, a possibility distribution information system (PDIS). Then, several IQ measures are defined in the PDIS, including Gini entropy, compatibility, conflict, credibility, and separability degrees. In view of this, a minimal-separability-minimal-uncertainty-based unsupervised feature selection algorithm (UmSMU) is designed. The proposed UmSMU can sufficiently fuse multiple possibilistic information. Meanwhile, the selected features maintain as much information as possible while minimizing the uncertainty of information. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well, especially when it comes to selecting fewer features and improving performance.

AB This article is concerned with the control design of adaptive fuzzy fixed-time high-order sliding mode (HOSM) under asymmetric output constraints. The main objective of this article is to construct a control scheme to build the HOSM in a fixed time and fulfill the preset constraint condition. For this purpose, initially to conquer this obstacle regarding the output constraint, a barrier Lyapunov function is developed to keep the output variable within the predefined constraint during operation. Then, the unknown functional bounds of uncertainties in the considered system are modeled by invoking fuzzy logic systems. With the integrated use of adaptive fuzzy control and backstepping-like techniques, a novel protocol for the fixed-time HOSM control with asymmetric output constraints is developed. Through the strictly theoretical clarification, the HOSM is fixed time established under the suggested control strategy. The effectiveness of the derived results is eventually testified by some comparative simulation results.

AB This article mainly studies the synchronization problem for a class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy quaternion-valued inertial neural networks with time-varying delay through event-triggered control (ETC) scheme. First, a class of quaternion-valued inertial fuzzy neural networks (QVIFNNs) model with time-varying delay is proposed. To avoid the increase of the number of state variables caused by reduced-order method, nonreduced order approach is utilized fully, and a fuzzy exponential gain event-triggered controller is designed so as to occupy the less communication resources. Then, by establishing a novel Lyapunov functional well handling the high-order term, a new synchronization condition is derived under static event-triggered scheme. And then, to further reduce the number of triggers, a dynamic event-triggered condition is developed and the corresponding sufficient criterion is given. Meanwhile, it is proved that the lower bound of event intervals are nonzero positive and the Zeno phenomenons do not exist via rigorous mathematical derivation. Finally, a numerical example is offered to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. An application example for the considered QVIFNNs with time-varying delay is given.

AB This article focuses on the finite-time stabilization problem for fuzzy spatiotemporal competitive neural networks (FSCNNs) with discrete and distributed delays. First, the differentiable conditions for discrete and finite distributed delays in FSCNNs are removed, and the constraints of the kernel function in infinite distributed delays are weakened. Then, a novel partial differential inequality is proposed to handle the spatial diffusions, which relaxes the restriction for symmetric around the origin of the bounded spatial domain. To stabilize FSCNNs within a finite time, a novel control strategy without delay-dependent terms is established. Moreover, different from the existing works, a more succinct Lyapunov functional is constructed, which does not need to include multiple integral type functional terms to eliminate the influence of the hybrid delays. By virtue of the comparison method and inequality techniques, several sufficient criteria are deduced to guarantee the finite-time stabilization of FSCNNs. Finally, simulations are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Social network group decision making (SN-GDM) provides valuable support for obtaining agreed decision results by effectively utilizing the connected social trust relationships among individuals. However, the impact of intricately overlapped social trust relationships within overlapping communities on evaluation modifications in the SN-GDM consensus reaching process is seldom considered. To alleviate this issue, this study attempts to construct an overlapping community-driven feedback mechanism for improving consensus in SN-GDM. The Lancichinetti-Fortunato method is used to detect the overlapping community structures under social trust networks. Subsequently, the trusted recommendation advice is conducted within overlapping communities, which guides the inconsistent subgroups to make an interaction with each other to reach higher consensus level. Then, an associated feedback mechanism for SN-GDM with overlapping communities is proposed, which enables the inconsistent subgroups to minimize the consensus cost by selecting personalized feedback parameters. Moreover, it shows that the overlapping communities based feedback mechanism is superior to the feedback mechanisms with nonoverlapping communities. Finally, an illustrative example is included, which is also used to testify the efficacy of proposal by comparing the consensus cost under different representative recommendation advice in overlapping social trust networks.

AB With the development of social media, social networks (SNs) have gradually become the link of information exchange between people. The social trust network (STN), a typical SN, is considered the basis of interaction for experts. Therefore, in the STN environment, an STN-driven consensus decision framework of multiattribute group decision making is developed. First, a two-stage analysis method of STN completeness considering the social psychology of experts is proposed to obtain a complete STN, which includes the processes of trust propagation and aggregation. Second, based on the complete modified STN, an STN-driven consensus-reaching process is presented with a consensus optimization model aiming at minimum adjustments. In addition, a numerical example is used to further elaborate on the applicability of these methods. Finally, a series of simulation experiments are designed to objectively determine the parameters in the proposed methods and highlight the rationality and superiority of the proposed methods by comparisons and discussions with related studies.

AB In this article, we focus on the event-triggered observer-based fuzzy positioning control and L-2-gain analysis of nonlinear unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) systems in network environments, which is subject to a hybrid attack consisting of denial-of-service attack and deception attack. First, based on the Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy modeling method, a unified switched system model is established for the positioning control of nonlinear UMV systems with actuator saturation, multiplicative gain uncertainties, external disturbance, and hybrid attacks. Then, by resorting to introducing the integral-type state error, a novel adaptive memory-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed to lighten the communication load in UMV systems. Furthermore, a sufficient criterion is proposed to make the mean square exponential stability of UMV systems with a nonweighted L-2-gain level be guaranteed, and gain parameters of the designed controller and observer are also solved efficiently. Finally, the simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed nonfragile control strategy.

AB Explainability of deep neural networks has been receiving increasing attention with regard to auditability and trustworthiness purposes. Of the various post-hoc explainability approaches, rule extraction methods assist to understand the logic that underpins their functioning. Whereas the rule-based solutions are directly managed and understood by practitioners, the use of intervals or crisp values in the antecedents that rely on numerical values might not be intuitive enough. In this case, the benefits of a linguistic representation based on fuzzy sets/rules are straightforward, as these semantically meaningful components ease the model understanding. This article proposes fuzzy rule-based explainer systems for deep neural networks. The algorithm learns a compact yet accurate set of fuzzy rules based on features' importance (i.e., attribution values) distilled from the trained networks. These systems can be used for both local and global explainability purposes. The evaluation results of different applications revealed that the fuzzy explainers maintained the fidelity and accuracy of the original deep neural networks while implying lower complexity and better comprehensibility.

AB This article resolves the safety tracking problem of the robot manipulator with the actuator faults, process faults, uncertain dynamics, and external disturbances. A novel robust adaptive fuzzy fault tolerant control (FTC) framework is presented. In this approach, a constraint mechanism of the zero overshoot error is proposed to keep the filter variable within an adjustable range, and the compact set can be available. An adaptive fuzzy logic system is, then, employed to approximate the time-varying, nonlinear, and unknown robot dynamics. Furthermore, a robust adaptive term is designed to compensate the actuator faults and approximation errors, and ensure the convergence and stability of the whole robot control system. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamics for the robot manipulator is proved by the Lyapunov function. Afterward, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust adaptive fuzzy FTC (RAFFTC) approach of the robot manipulator has good control performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed RAFFTC approach is verified by experiments.

AB Existing approaches to optimal control of uncertain switched systems require heavy computations for approximating and learning the optimal solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. To overcome this problem, a fuzzy adaptive inverse optimal control strategy is first developed for switched systems, which minimizes not only the cost function but also circumvents solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Specifically, an alternative practical inverse approach is developed by two Lyapunov functions method, based on which the inverse optimality regarding a meaningful cost function is achieved. In addition, a new condition of admissible edge-dependent average dwell time is developed by applying the extended multiple Lyapunov functions method. Guided by this weaker condition, the stability of the considered switched system is proved. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the developed method.

AB In the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP), immediate predecessor operations have an explicit impact on the scheduling results, and are often ignored. To analyze the influence of immediate predecessor operations on machine tool manufacturing workshops, four forms of immediate predecessor operations with the consideration of uncertain transportation and preparation time are defined. Then, the four forms of immediate predecessor operations are integrated into the FJSP, and a multiobjective FJSP is constructed. An improved optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) are combined to establish a multiobjective optimization algorithm, named PFSOFA. This algorithm is then used to solve the multiobjective FJSP. In PFSOFA, the Pareto fronts are mapped into PFSs. The Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) in a PFS are transformed into right triangles, and the distances between the PFNs and the reference PFNs are defined as the distances between their right triangle centroids. Then, all distances of a PFS are integrated by the distance prospect function to obtain a distance prospect value. This value is then used to lead the iteration of PFSOFA. Through extensive experiments, including a real factory application case, the performance of PFSOFA is verified to be better than four classical multiobjective optimization algorithms for solving the multiobjective FJSP constructed in this article. And for the factory case, PFSOFA also obtained the better schemes.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
AB Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set theory combined with twin support vector machines (TSVM) has shown highly advantageous performance in robust and fast classification. However, the existing methods have some inherent flaws: 1) The inaccurate confidence caused by the single-center-based IF strategy degrades the classification performance of the model. 2) The nonmembership degree is time-consuming and the threshold is difficult to determine, as it depends on sample's local neighborhood set. 3) Recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that optimizing the margin distribution achieve better generalization performance than maximizing the minimum margin in SVM-based models (SVMs). In view of the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a novel dual-center based IF (DC-IF) function, and introduce the margin distribution into IFTSVM, forming a DC-IF twin bounded large margin distribution machines (DC-IFTBLDM). Initially, the DC-IF strategy references the contribution of one sample to both categories, which is time efficient and more accurately reflects the credibility of the samples. Moreover, the margin mean and variance are used to optimize the margin distribution, and a regularization term is utilized to minimize structural risk. Therefore, DC-IFTBLDM has a good performance in noise immunity and classification capability. Comparative experiments based on synthetic datasets, UCI benchmark datasets, and datasets with different noise ratios verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The parameter sensitivity analysis further proves the high accuracy and stability of DC-IFTBLDM.

ID TRACKING
AB This article considers the finite-time containment output-feedback control problem for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with unmeasurable states and input saturation. Fuzzy logic systems and a smooth function are first employed to model unknown agent's subsystems and input saturation, respectively. Then, a novel fuzzy state observer is established via the intermittent output signal. By introducing the first-order filter and using the sampled estimating states and triggered output signals, an event-triggered mechanism consisting of the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator is formulated. Consequently, under the framework of the finite-time stability criterion and adaptive backstepping control design technique, a finite-time adaptive fuzzy event-triggered output-feedback containment control design method is proposed and the semiglobal finite-time stability of the controlled system is rigorously proved. Finally, the simulation results are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB An event-triggered output feedback control approach is proposed via a disturbance observer and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The solution starts by constructing a nonlinear disturbance observer, which only depends on the measurement of system output. A state observer is then developed based on approximation information of system dynamics via neural networks. In order to avoid continuous transmission and reduce the communication burden in the closed-loop system, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced such that the control signal is updated only at a specific instant when a triggered condition is violated. By virtue of the disturbance observer and state observer, an output-feedback ADP control approach then is developed, where only a critic network is employed to estimate the value function. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed, and the effectiveness of the proposed control approach is verified by two simulation examples.

AB Supervisory control of fuzzy discrete event systems (FDES) under partial observation is investigated in this article. Without loss of generality, we consider FDES with constraints where a FDES is modeled by a fuzzy automaton. Sequences of events that can be generated by the system are regarded as constraints and are modeled by a crisp automaton. A supervisor is designed to control the FDES so that the supervised system is prevented from entering a prespecified set of illegal/unsafe fuzzy states. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a supervisor is obtained. When the condition is satisfied, an online supervisor can be designed. Fuzzy state estimation problem is first solved, as the supervisor is fuzzy-state-estimate-based. A method is developed to estimate fuzzy state iteratively after observation of each new event. We show that the supervisor so developed ensures the safety of the system and is least restrictive among all possible safe supervisors. Potential of the theoretical results for real-world applications is illustrated through an example of HIV/AIDS treatment decision-making.

By designing the state feedback and output feedback controllers, and based on the Lyapunov functional, two new sufficient conditions for the reachable set control are established. The state feedback and output feedback controller gains are obtained by optimizing the iterative algorithm. Then, all the state trajectories of the closed-loop T-S FSMJSs are contained by the intersection of ellipsoids. Finally, two examples with practical application background are presented to show the validity and usability of the proposed methods.

AB This article focuses on the fault reconstruction and fault-tolerant control problems of switched fuzzy systems with actuator and sensor faults, where the faults may be fast time-varying and unbounded. The multiple coordinate transformations are introduced, then the reduced-order observer based fault reconstruction method is considered, which can reconstruct the system state, actuator, and sensor faults, simultaneously. For the case that there is no disturbance, the LMI conditions are achieved to ensure that for any switching signal, the error dynamics can be exponentially stable. Utilizing the estimated fault information, the fuzzy dynamic output feedback fault tolerant controllers are designed to compensate the fault effect and stabilize the systems. The root-mean-square gain is considered to reduce the disturbance influence on fault estimation and fault-tolerant control, in which the zero initial condition is not needed. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the considered techniques.

AB This article studies the stability and stabilization of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy time-delay systems under sampled-data control via a new asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method. The method improves the common symmetric basic functional term. Besides, we improve the looped-functional term and the discontinuous functional term through combining the integral about time delay and each sampling interval, respectively. Based on the abovementioned new approaches, we present the stability and stabilization results with less conservativeness than the literature through linear matrix inequalities. In the process, we introduce a simplification approach for stabilization of sampled-data control, which effectively reduces the computational complexity of results. At last, we provide three examples to verify the effects and advantages of our results.

AB This article aims to resolve the three major issues of fault tolerant control (FTC) for robot manipulators: 1) the faster response, lower tracking errors, lower chattering, and higher robustness of the FTC, 2) the requirement of partial or full knowledge of robot dynamics for the design of model-based FTC, and 3) the global fixed-time convergence of the system. First, a fixed-time controller based on a backstepping control is designed and its disadvantages are analyzed. Then, an adaptive fuzzy backstepping control is developed to enhance the tracking performance of the system. The proposed approach does not require the full prior knowledge of robot dynamic model, thus facilitating implementation of the controller in practical applications. In addition, the tracking errors of the system will be practically convergent within a fixed-time, which provides additional system information in advance. The fixed time convergence of the system is mathematically proved and the performance of the system is demonstrated for FTC of a PUMA560 robot.

AB Due to the existence of strong nonlinearity and external disturbances, the controller design of complex nonlinear systems is a challenging problem. Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective robust predictive controller for this issue. In this article, based on a fuzzy neural network, an iterative learning model predictive control (FNN-ILMPC) is designed for complex nonlinear systems. First, a dynamic linearization technique is used to establish a data-driven model, which only relies on input and output data. Since the established model contains an unknown disturbance term that may have an impact on the control performance, an FNN is used to evaluate the disturbance so that the uncertainty of the system is captured. Subsequently, based on the above data-driven model, an FNN-ILMPC strategy, considering the impact of external disturbances, is developed to eliminate the influence of disturbances. Then, it is proved that the designed controller can make both modeling error and tracking error decrease gradually and ensure the closed-loop system stability. Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the designed controller.

AB This article investigates the fault reconstruction problem for a class of continuous-time switched systems subject to persistent dwell-time (PDT) switching. In order to relax the rank condition of the perturbations' coefficient matrices in fuzzy fault reconstruction results, a novel adaptive fuzzy design approach is developed by decomposing the perturbations into virtual faults and states. Then, the PDT switching is first considered in the adaptive fuzzy observer to overcome the restricted switching frequency problem, which can guarantee the stability of the estimation error systems with fast and slow switching characteristics simultaneously. Moreover, the unknown nonlinearities, actuator faults and disturbances can be reconstructed by the designed adaptive mechanism, where the switching problem of sliding surfaces in sliding-mode observers can be avoided. Finally, a circuit system example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fault reconstruction scheme.

AB In practice, it is common that there will be the same decision results under different scale conditions. Therefore, knowledge representation based on a single scale feature framework is far from meeting the needs of practical applications. Based on this, multiscale data have received extensive attention. Feature selection is an important application of fuzzy multigranularity data analysis model. The existing multiscale fuzzy granulation-based feature selection methods remove redundant or irrelevant features by selecting the optimal scale. However, this will lose the information corresponding to the remaining scale fuzzy granules, which will affect the classification results or learning tasks. Inspired by this, multiscale fuzzy entropy is defined to fuse the granule information at different scales, and applied to feature selection. First, the feature with maximum multiscale fuzzy mutual information is first selected. Then, the most significant features are gradually selected by evaluation metric that simultaneously considers the redundancy, relevance, and complementary. A multiscale fuzzy entropy-based feature selection algorithm by means of this evaluation index is further designed. Finally, the proposed method is compared with some state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has higher reduction efficiency than the comparison algorithms.

AB Formal concept analysis (FCA) extracts interpretable rules by using implication relationships between concepts, which is an effective method for acquiring knowledge. In this article, a fuzzy decision rule-based online classification algorithm called OFRCA is designed by combining online learning theory and FCA in a fuzzy formal decision context. First, the original weight vector of all attributes is obtained by fusing the original deterministic decision rules. Second, incremental fuzzy decision rules are obtained according to the added objects. Then, for the incremental fuzzy decision rules, OFRCA updates the weight vector based on minimizing the loss function. At the end of the process, all the rules are fused into an attribute-weighted classifier with the final weight vector. In this article, we employ the regret to obtain a learning guarantee for OFRCA. The growth rate of OFRCA's regret converges to 0 as the number of iterations increases in the ideal state, which provides an effective learning guarantee for OFRCA. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, this article conducted numerical experiments and systematically analyzed the experimental results, which demonstrated that OFRCA achieved the highest advanced classification performance among the compared algorithms.

AB Seldom existing studies directly focus on the control issues of 2-D spatial partial differential equation (PDE) systems, although they have strong application backgrounds in production and life. Therefore, this article investigates the finite-time control problem of a 2-D spatial nonlinear parabolic PDE system via a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy boundary control scheme. First, the overall fuzzy system model is constructed using T-S fuzzy rules to approximate the original nonlinear system. Second, based on the planar distributed measurement, boundary collocated measurement, and linear measurement methods, three novel kinds of fuzzy boundary controllers are designed, respectively. Then, by employing the variable substitution and integral inequality techniques, three criteria that ensure the finite-time boundness of the considered system are obtained. Finally, simulations of main results are provided to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed measurement and control schemes.

AB Label distribution learning (LDL), leveraging the label significance (LS), is more appropriate for solving label ambiguity problems than multilabel learning (MLL). However, directly obtaining the LS of LDL is extremely expensive and challenging. Thus, label enhancement (LE) algorithms are effectively proposed to acquire inherent LS from MLL for training the LDL models. Nevertheless, most existing LE models will suffer from low accuracy and low efficiency with following issues: ignoring mapping relationship between feature and label space, resulting in inaccurate enhanced data; designing independently apart from LDL models, resulting in an inability of unified LE-LDL learning; and requiring to optimize numerous parameters iteratively, resulting in worse training efficiency. Consequently, a novel unified LE-LDL learning framework, namely stacked graph-regularized polynomial-based fuzzy broad learning system (SGP-FBLS), is proposed by following three innovations: polynomial-based fuzzy system is introduced to enhance feature mapping ability while improving the learning performance effectively; graph regularized-based optimization objective function (GP-FBLS) is presented by considering interinstance correlation and label correlation to mine potential LS, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent LDL tasks; and a weight stacked strategy is innovatively proposed to directly transmit LS and weighted parameters from GP-FBLS to SGP-FBLS without retraining, achieving the most satisfactory performance while significantly improving the training efficiency. Finally, comparative studies on 19 practical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed methods.

AB The propagation redundant (PR) proof system generalizes the resolution and resolution asymmetric tautology proof systems used by conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers. PR allows short proofs of unsatisfiability for some problems that are difficult for CDCL solvers. Previous attempts to automate PR clause learning used hand-crafted heuristics that work well on some highly-structured problems. For example, the solver SaDiCaL incorporates PR clause learning into the CDCL loop, but it cannot compete with modern CDCL solvers due to its fragile heuristics. We present PReLearn, a preprocessing technique that learns short PR clauses. Adding these clauses to a formula reduces the search space that the solver must explore. By performing PR clause learning as a preprocessing stage, PR clauses can be found efficiently without sacrificing the robustness of modern CDCL solvers. On a large portion of SAT competition benchmarks we found that preprocessing with PReLearn improves solver performance. In addition, there were several satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas that could only be solved after preprocessing with PReLearn. PReLearn supports proof logging, giving a high level of confidence in the results. Lastly, we tested the robustness of PReLearn by applying other forms of preprocessing as well as by randomly permuting variable names in the formula before running PReLearn, and we found PReLearn performed similarly with and without the changes to the formula.

AB The purpose of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to identify the sentiment polarity of a given aspect of a sentence. Recent investigations have revealed that incorporating syntactic structures derived from dependency-parsing trees into graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can yield excellent performance. However, these GCN-based methods excessively rely on the quality of the dependency-parsing tree, resulting possibly in suboptimal dependencies between words. Moreover, these GCN-based models fail to adapt properly to informal and complex comments without syntactic dependencies. To alleviate these deficiencies, we proposed a target-based GCN with semantic and syntactic information (TSGCN). In a TSGCN, a new target generation (NTG) module with a dependency attention mechanism is designed to generate a new target representation using explicit semantic information to replace a given aspect. Then, the syntactic structure is reconstructed based on the new target representation to capture the shortest distance between the given aspect and viewpoint words. Finally, the semantic structure generated by the self-attention mechanism was injected into the syntactic structure to complement the semantic dependencies between words. The experimental findings on five benchmark datasets indicated that the TSGCN outperformed the other baseline models. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a non-parametric methodology based on classical unsupervised clustering techniques to automatically identify the main regions of a space, without requiring the objective number of clusters, so as to identify the major regular states of unknown industrial systems. Indeed, useful knowledge on real industrial processes entails the identification of their regular states, and their historically encountered anomalies. Since both should form compact and salient groups of data, unsupervised clustering generally performs this task fairly accurately; however, this often requires the number of clusters upstream, knowledge which is rarely available. As such, the proposed algorithm operates a first partitioning of the space, then it estimates the integrity of the clusters, and splits them again and again until every cluster obtains an acceptable integrity; finally, a step of merging based on the clusters' empirical distributions is performed to refine the partitioning. Applied to real industrial data obtained in the scope of a European project, this methodology proved able to automatically identify the main regular states of the system. Results show the robustness of the proposed approach in the fully-automatic and non-parametric identification of the main regions of a space, knowledge which is useful to industrial anomaly detection and behavioral modeling.

AB Augmented Reality (AR) is increasingly present in several fields, including the museological space, where the challenges of presenting objects interactively and attractively are constant, especially with the sociocultural changes of recent decades. Although there are numerous studies on AR in museums, the perspective of museum professionals on the technology still needs to be explored. Thus, in this study, we use a qualitative design and conduct in-depth interviews with professionals from 10 Portuguese museums involved in creating or applying AR within these environments. Applying the grounded theory, the researchers propose a framework to understand Portuguese museum professionals' practices, perceptions, and experiences with AR in museum environments. The findings allow the creation of a theoretical framework divided into four levels, namely the perceptions of museum professionals on the role and use of AR, the understanding of departments, museum teams, and digital strategies, the perceived challenges, limitations, and advantages in the use of augmented reality technologies, and the future perspectives of AR in museums. The theory resulting from this study may also contribute suggestions for the design and implementation of AR in museums, which both museum professionals and designers can use.

ID DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISIONS
AB The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to bring transparency to today's powerful but opaque deep learning models. While local XAI methods explain individual predictions in the form of attribution maps, thereby identifying 'where' important features occur (but not providing information about 'what' they represent), global explanation techniques visualize what concepts a model has generally learned to encode. Both types of method thus provide only partial insights and leave the burden of interpreting the model's reasoning to the user. Here we introduce the Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP) approach, which combines the local and global perspectives and thus allows answering both the 'where' and 'what' questions for individual predictions. We demonstrate the capability of our method in various settings, showcasing that CRP leads to more human interpretable explanations and provides deep insights into the model's representation and reasoning through concept atlases, concept-composition analyses, and quantitative investigations of concept subspaces and their role in fine-grained decision-making.
   Local methods of explainable artificial intelligence identify where important features or inputs occur, while global methods try to understand what features or concepts have been learned by a model. The authors propose a concept-level explanation method that bridges the local and global perspectives, enabling more comprehensive and human-understandable explanations.

ID INTELLIGENCE; DEEPER
AB Event-based visual, a new visual paradigm with bio-inspired dynamic perception and & mu;s level temporal resolution, has prominent advantages in many specific visual scenarios and gained much research interest. Spiking neural network (SNN) is naturally suitable for dealing with event streams due to its temporal information processing capability and event-driven nature. However, existing works SNN neglect the fact that the input event streams are spatially sparse and temporally non-uniform, and just treat these variant inputs equally. This situation interferes with the effectiveness and efficiency of existing SNNs. In this paper, we propose the feature Refine-and-Mask SNN (RM-SNN), which has the ability of self-adaption to regulate the spiking response in a data-dependent way. We use the Refine-and-Mask (RM) module to refine all features and mask the unimportant features to optimize the membrane potential of spiking neurons, which in turn drops the spiking activity. Inspired by the fact that not all events in spatio-temporal streams are task-relevant, we execute the RM module in both temporal and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on seven event-based benchmarks, DVS128 Gesture, DVS128 Gait, CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101, DailyAction-DVS, UCF101-DVS, and HMDB51-DVS demonstrate that under the multi-scale constraints of input time window, RM-SNN can significantly reduce the network average spiking activity rate while improving the task performance. In addition, by visualizing spiking responses, we analyze why sparser spiking activity can be better. Code & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the realm of multi-class classification, the twin K-class support vector classification (Twin-KSVC) generates ternary outputs {-1, 0,+1} by evaluating all training data in a ''1-versus-1-versus-rest'' structure. Recently, inspired by the least-squares version of Twin-KSVC and Twin-KSVC, a new multi-class classifier called improvements on least-squares twin multi-class classification support vector machine (ILSTKSVC) has been proposed. In this method, the concept of structural risk minimization is achieved by incorporating a regularization term in addition to the minimization of empirical risk. Twin-KSVC and its improvements have an influence on classification accuracy. Another aspect influencing classification accuracy is feature selection, which is a critical stage in machine learning, especially when working with high-dimensional datasets. However, most prior studies have not addressed this crucial aspect. In this study, motivated by ILSTKSVC and the cardinality-constrained optimization problem, we propose l(p)-norm least-squares twin multi-class support vector machine (PLSTKSVC) with 0 < p < 1 to perform classification and feature selection at the same time. The technique employed to solve the optimization problems associated with PLSTKSVC is user-friendly, as it involves solving systems of linear equations to obtain an approximate solution for the proposed model. Under certain assumptions, we investigate the properties of the optimum solutions to the related optimization problems. Several real-world datasets were tested using the suggested method. According to the results of our experiments, the proposed method outperforms all current strategies in most datasets in terms of classification accuracy while also reducing the number of features.

AB This work aims to achieve cluster synchronization of a complex network by some pinning control strategies. Firstly, the network not only is affected by the reaction-diffusion and the directed coupling phenomena, but also is disturbed by the stochastic noise and Markovian switching. Secondly, switched constant gain pinning, centralized and decentralized adaptive pinning are proposed respectively to realize the cluster synchronization of the considered network. In these adaptive pinning controllers, the control gain and coupling strength can been adjusted automatically while only a part of the nodes are controlled. Thirdly, the target state of cluster synchronization is taken as the average state related to the directed topology of all nodes in the same cluster, and does not need to be given separately as an isolated node. Finally, to verify the theoretical results, some simulations of directed coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks with stochastic noise and Markovian switching are given. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Complementary-label learning (CLL) is widely used in weakly supervised classification, but it faces a significant challenge in real-world datasets when confronted with class-imbalanced training samples. In such scenarios, the number of samples in one class is considerably lower than in other classes, which consequently leads to a decline in the accuracy of predictions. Unfortunately, existing CLL approaches have not investigate this problem. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel problem setting that enables learning from class-imbalanced complementary labels for multi-class classification. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel CLL approach called Weighted Complementary-Label Learning (WCLL). The proposed method models a weighted empirical risk minimization loss by utilizing the class-imbalanced complementary labels, which is also applicable to multi-class imbalanced training samples. Furthermore, we derive an estimation error bound to provide theoretical assurance. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on several widely-used benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset, and compare our method with existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach shows significant improvement in these datasets, even in the case of multiple class-imbalanced scenarios. Notably, the proposed method not only utilizes complementary labels to train a classifier but also solves the problem of class imbalance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NASH EQUILIBRIUM SEEKING; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIFFERENTIAL-GAME; SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, N-cluster games with coupling and private constraints are studied, where each player's cost function is nonsmooth and depends on the actions of all players. In order to seek the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the nonsmooth N-cluster games, a distributed seeking neurodynamic approach with two-time-scale structure is proposed. An adaptive leader-following consensus technique is adapted to dynamically adjust parameters according to the degree of consensus violation, so as to quickly obtain accurate estimation information of other players' actions which facilitates the evaluation of its own cost. Benefitting from the unique structure of the approach based on primal dual and adaptive penalty methods, the players' actions enter the constraints while completing the seeking for GNE. As a result, the neurodynamic approach is completely distributed, and prior estimation of penalty parameters is avoided. Finally, two engineering examples of power system game and company capacity allocation verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the neurodynamic approach. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS), the interactions among various entities form complex graphs. Many tasks can be formulated as instances of node classification. Node classification on graphs has attracted increasing research interest. However, the performance of existing graph neural networks for few-shot node classification has not achieved satisfactory results due to the limitation of the number of labeled instances. Therefore, we propose a graph-weighted prototype scaling network (GWPSN) based on deep metric learning for addressing the graph few-shot node classification problem. Specifically, we first extract node representations for the attributed graph via the simplifying graph convolutional network. At the same time, learning the importance of each node in the attributed graph is used to aggregate class prototypes. Finally, the class of the test node can be predicted by comparing the scaled metric distance between the test node and the class prototype. Experiments indicate that GWPSN can achieve superior performance on three real-world datasets and thus can provide enhanced few-shot classification services for CPSS.

   Transformer; Sequence-to-sequence
AB Sign language translation is a complex task that involves generating spoken-language sentences from sign language (SL) videos, considering the signer's manual and nonmanual movements. We observed the following issues with existing SL translation (SLT) methods and datasets for improving performance. First, every SL video frame does not have gloss notation. Second, nonmanual components can be easily overlooked despite their importance because they occur in small areas of the image. Third, recent SLT models, based on the transformer, have numerous parameters and struggle to capture the local context of SL images comprehensively. To address these problems, we propose an action tokenizer that divides SL videos into semantic units. In addition, we design a keypoint emphasizer and convolutional-embedded SL transformer (CSLT) to understand noticeable manual and subtle nonmanual features effectively. By applying the proposed modules to Sign2 (Gloss+Text), we introduce CSLT with an action tokenizer and keypoint emphasizer (CSLT-AK), a simple yet efficient and effective SLT model based on domain knowledge. The experimental results on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T reveal that CSLT-AK surpasses the baseline regarding performance and parameter reduction and demonstrates competitive performance without the need for regularization methods compared to other state-of-the-art models.

AB The dynamics of affective decision making is considered for an intelligent network composed of agents with different types of memory: long-term and short-term memory. The consideration is based on probabilistic affective decision theory, which takes into account the rational utility of alternatives as well as the emotional alternative attractiveness. The objective of this paper is the comparison of two multistep operational algorithms of the intelligent network: one based on discrete dynamics and the other on continuous dynamics. By means of numerical analysis, it is shown that, depending on the network parameters, the characteristic probabilities for continuous and discrete operations can exhibit either close or drastically different behavior. Thus, depending on which algorithm is employed, either discrete or continuous, theoretical predictions can be rather different, which does not allow for a uniquely defined description of practical problems. This finding is important for understanding which of the algorithms is more appropriate for the correct analysis of decision-making tasks. A discussion is given, revealing that the discrete operation seems to be more realistic for describing intelligent networks as well as affective artificial intelligence.

AB Existing supervised learning-based low-light image enhancement algorithms treat all degradations as a whole, resulting in limited enhancement performance. It is difficult for fully unsupervised learning to recover more hidden details, making the augmented results unsatisfactory for visual needs. To overwhelm the limitations of supervised and unsupervised learning, we propose a Semi-Supervised Network Framework (SSNF) to enhance low-light images. Specifically, we decouple the low-light image enhancement task into two stages. In the first stage of the SSNF, we employ methods based on information entropy and Retinex to improve the visibility of images. It is worth mentioning that this stage is a lightweight self-supervised network, which only needs to input low-light images and undergo minute-level training to achieve brightness improvement. In the second stage of the SSNF, we utilize U-Net and residual networks to remove problems such as noise and degradation existing in the first-stage enhancement results, thereby improving the visual properties of the enhanced images. It overwhelms the challenge of dealing with low-light images directly. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets such as LOL, synthetic, DICM, etc. The experimental results show that SSNF exhibits better visual effects and outperforms other advanced methods in performance metrics.

AB In the directed energy deposition process, online monitoring of weld bead geometry can give real-time information to researchers and manufacturers to understand and control the metal deposition layer by layer. In the current work, an optimization Grey model OGM(1,N)-based online monitoring system was built to monitor the height and depth of metal deposition in each layer. The OGM(1,N) needs fewer training samples with poor information. The training data was updated to improve accuracy in prediction by removing old data and introducing more recent data. The inputs to the OGM(1,N) include the welding time, current, absolute difference in current at regular time intervals (5 s) and arc force. An optimum set of input parameters was identified by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) for various parameter combinations for the most accurate weld bead height and depth prediction. The interaction of time, current, and arc force significantly affected the height and depth of weld beads. The predicted height and depth of weld beads using the time, current, and arc force showed RMSEs of 2.52 and 0.23, respectively, compared to experimental results. This methodology can assist manufacturers and researchers in understanding and achieving an appropriate balance between process parameters and weld bead height with no training time.

However, this kind of model is always limited to the distribution-based method, which can only conduct symmetric prediction intervals and heavily rely on accurate point prediction and preprogrammed errors' probability distribution. Therefore, we make the following improvements for enriching research on the interval prediction of carbon price and providing more references for researchers in related fields. Firstly, lower upper bound estimation model (LUBE) is employed to conduct the prediction interval rather than the distribution-based method, and this designer can generate asymmetric upper and lower bounds without the need for assumptions and humanly devised parameters. Secondly, the causal inference is applied to the feature selection rather than the correlation analysis, which can well improve the generalization ability of prediction model. Thirdly, we improved the objectives when using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for searching more efficient solutions in less time. Finally, through various experiments the most effective combination of LUBE and the ensemble method are verified, which are also proved by experiments.

AB In the realm of conventional deep-learning-based pan-sharpening approaches, there has been an ongoing struggle to harmonize the input panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MS) images across varied channels. Existing methods have often been stymied by spectral distortion and an inadequate texture representation. To address these limitations, we present an innovative constraint-based image generation strategy tailored for the pan-sharpening task. Our method employs a multi-scale conditional invertible neural network, named PSCINN, which is capable of converting the ground truth MS image into a downscaled MS image and a latent variable, all under the guidance of the PAN image. Subsequently, the resampled latent variable, obtained from a prior distribution, and the low-resolution MS image are harnessed to predict the pan-sharpened image in an information-preserving manner, with the PAN image providing essential guidance during the reversion process. Furthermore, we meticulously architect a conditional invertible block to construct a Jacobian Determinant for the spectral information recovery. This structure effectively pre-processes the conditioning PAN image into practical texture information, thereby preventing the spectral information in the pan-sharpened result from potential contamination. The proposed PSCINN outperforms existing state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methodologies, both in terms of objective and subjective results. Post-treatment experiments underscore a substantial enhancement in the perceived quality attributed to our method. The source code for PSCINN will be accessible at https://github.com/jiaming-wang/PSCINN.

ID NETWORK
AB Object detection and instance segmentation have been successful on benchmarks with relatively balanced category distribution (e.g. MSCOCO). However, state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation methods still struggle to generalize on long-tailed datasets (e.g. LVIS), where a few classes (head classes) dominate the instance samples, while most classes (tailed classes) have only a few samples. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play module within the Mask R-CNN framework called dynamic instance memory (DIM). Specifically, we augment Mask R-CNN with an auxiliary branch for training. It maintains a dynamic memory bank storing an instance-level prototype representation for each category, and shares the classifier with the existing instance branch. With a simple metric loss, the representations in DIM can be dynamically updated by the instance proposals in the mini-batch during training. Our DIM introduces a bias toward tailed classes to the classifier learning along with a class frequency reversed sampler, which learns generalizable representations from the original data distribution, complementing the existing instance branch. Comprehensive experiments on LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of DIM, as well as the significant advantages of DIM over the baseline Mask R-CNN.

DE Face attribute recognition; Multi-dataset fusion; Multi-task learning;
   Knowledge distillation; Deep learning
AB The goal of face attribute recognition(FAR) is to recognize the attributes of face images, such as gender, race, etc. Multi-dataset fusion aims to train a network with multiple datasets simultaneously, which has significant advantages in deep learning. For example, in FAR, the attribute labels differ with the datasets. When using multi-dataset fusion on FAR, training data and attribute labels can be increased so that the network performance can be improved and more attributes can be recognized simultaneously. Currently, most related researchers take the multi-task learning approach on FAR, where each attribute is treated as a recognition task. However, the existing multi-task learning framework cannot be applied when using multi-dataset fusion on FAR. That is because multi-task learning requires the training data to contain the labels of all tasks, but no data contains all the attribute labels of multiple datasets. A Multi-Dataset and Multi-Task Framework(MDMTF) that takes knowledge distillation as the core is proposed in this paper to deal with the problem above. Three distillation strategies are designed in the MDMTF according to the characteristics of multi-dataset fusion on FAR. Experimental results on CelebA and MAAD-Face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and strategies. Compared to training two networks on both datasets, respectively, that is, single dataset training, our method has significant advantages in accuracy, parameters, and computational complexity.

AB Use of simulation data is necessary for training fault diagnostic models because there is an insufficient amount of fault data available for intricate supercritical flexible shafting. A hybrid dynamic modelling approach combining finite element and lumped mass techniques was used to construct dynamic models of the system in both normal and fault states. The simulation signals corresponding to each state were obtained through numerical calculations and subsequently compared with the existing literature to ensure the accuracy and validity of the dynamic model. By establishing this foundation, dependable training data can be acquired for fault diagnosis within a system. A deep residual neural network with a multi-scale convolution kernel (MSResNet) was used to conduct fault diagnosis of the flexible shafting. The efficacy of the suggested approach was substantiated through an experimental analysis. The outcomes of this research establish a theoretical foundation for fault diagnosis of flexible shafting in scenarios with an insufficient number of fault samples. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Self-supervised learning; Graph representation learning; Graph neural
   network
AB Graph representation is a critical technology in the field of knowledge engineering and knowledgebased applications since most knowledge bases are represented in the graph structure. Nowadays, contrastive learning has become a prominent way for graph representation by contrasting positive- positive and positive-negative node pairs between two augmentation graphs. It has achieved new state-of-the-art in the field of self-supervised graph representation. However, existing contrastive graph representation methods mainly focus on modifying (normally removing some edges/nodes) the original graph structure to generate the augmentation graph for the contrastive. It inevitably changes the original graph structures, meaning the generated augmentation graph is no longer equivalent to the original graph. This harms the performance of the representation in many structure-sensitive graphs such as protein graphs, chemical graphs, molecular graphs, etc. Moreover, there is only one positive-positive node pair but relatively massive positive-negative node pairs in the self-supervised graph contrastive learning. This can lead to the same class, or very similar samples are considered negative samples. To this end, in this work, we propose a Virtual Masking Augmentation (VMA) to generate an augmentation graph without changing any structures from the original graph. Meanwhile, a node augmentation method is proposed to augment the positive node pairs by discovering the most similar nodes in the same graph. Then, two different augmentation graphs are generated and put into a contrastive learning model to learn the graph representation. Extensive experiments on massive datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on self-supervised graph representation.

AB In intelligent manufacturing systems, the industrial informatics has features of multi-source, multi-noise, and time series. It is difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to directly exploit the enormous amounts of data due to the limited budgets and computing capabilities. Edge intelligence is a key technique to power intelligent manufacturing systems and provide knowledge transferred from the cloud to SMEs at the edges. To address edge-cloud collaboration issue, we propose a refined data-driven distributionally robust newsvendor model based on & phi;-divergence measures and imprecise Dirichlet models (DRN-IDM). We construct new distributional uncertainty sets by effectively integrating local censored demand data and cloud knowledge, which helps SMEs to make intelligent production decisions and reduce significant decision deviations, even under a small censored data set. In particular, the novel demand uncertainty sets can depict the distance between distributions and probability intervals. Then, we transform the DRN-IDM model into a convex optimization model that is amenable to algorithmic implementation. Additionally, based on the coefficient of variation of limited historical data, we propose an adaptive demand information fusion procedure to achieve excellent synergy effect from cloud knowledge. We also validate the effectiveness of the DRN-IDM model and the practicability of adaptive procedure using extensive numerical studies with both simulated and real-life data. Furthermore, we measure the relative expected value of cloud knowledge and investigate the effect of censored demand samples. Our results verify the effectiveness condition of the DRN-IDM model and indicate that cloud knowledge can improve the precision and robustness of SMEs' production decisions with small-scale censored data. Interestingly, the verified adaptive procedure can be applied in the learning criteria design of metaheuristics in intelligent manufacturing systems, and the reconstructed uncertainty set can narrow the search space to improve the convergence performance of algorithms.

AB Object recognition is often viewed as a feedforward, bottom-up process in machine learning, but in real neural systems, object recognition is a complicated process which involves the interplay between two signal pathways. One is the parvocellular pathway (P-pathway), which is slow and extracts fine features of objects; the other is the magnocellular pathway (M-pathway), which is fast and extracts coarse features of objects. It has been suggested that the interplay between the two pathways endows the neural system with the capacity of processing visual information rapidly, adaptively, and robustly. However, the underlying computational mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we build a two-pathway model to elucidate the computational properties associated with the interactions between two visual pathways. Specifically, we model two visual pathways using two convolution neural networks: one mimics the P-pathway, referred to as FineNet, which is deep, has small-size kernels, and receives detailed visual inputs; the other mimics the M-pathway, referred to as CoarseNet, which is shallow, has large-size kernels, and receives blurred visual inputs. We show that CoarseNet can learn from FineNet through imitation to improve its performance, FineNet can benefit from the feedback of CoarseNet to improve its robustness to noise; and the two pathways interact with each other to achieve rough-to-fine information processing. Using visual backward masking as an example, we further demonstrate that our model can explain visual cognitive behaviors that involve the interplay between two pathways. We hope that this study gives us insight into understanding the interaction principles between two visual pathways. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that provides tools for constructing and fitting Bayesian models. It offers an intuitive, readable syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. PyMC leverages the symbolic computation library PyTensor, allowing it to be compiled into a variety of computational backends, such as C, JAX, and Numba, which in turn offer access to different computational architectures including CPU, GPU, and TPU. Being a general modeling framework, PyMC supports a variety of models including generalized hierarchical linear regression and classification, time series, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and non-parametric models such as Gaussian processes (GPs). We demonstrate PyMC's versatility and ease of use with examples spanning a range of common statistical models. Additionally, we discuss the positive role of PyMC in the development of the open-source ecosystem for probabilistic programming.

DE Blockchain; Opinion leaders; Content contribution; ECWM-TOPSIS
AB Exploring the influence of social network users in the blockchain environment and identifying opinion leaders can help understand the information dissemination characteristics of blockchain social networks, direct the discovery of quality content, and avoid the spread of rumors. Members of blockchain-based social networks are given new responsibilities by token awards and consensus voting, which alters how users connect to the network and engage with one another. Based on blockchain theory and the relevant theories of opinion leaders in social networks, this article combines structural information and content contributions to identify opinion leaders. Firstly, user influence indicators are defined from the perspective of network structure and behavioral characteristics of user contributions. Then, ECWM is constructed, which combines the entropy weight method and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) weighting method to address the correlation and diversity among indicators. Furthermore, an improved Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), called ECWM-TOPSIS, is proposed to identify opinion leaders in blockchain social networks. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the method, we conducted a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm on the blockchain social platform Steemit by using two different methods (voting score and forwarding rate). The results show that ECWM-TOPSIS produces significantly higher performance than other methods for all selected top N opinion leaders.

AB Water and nitrogen (N) are major factors in plant growth and agricultural production. However, these are often confounded and produce overlapping symptoms of plant stress. The objective of this study is to verify whether the different levels of N treatment influence water status prediction and vice versa with hyperspectral modeling. We cultivated 108 maize plants in a greenhouse under three-level N treatments in combination with three-level water treatments. Hyperspectral images were collected from those plants, then Relative Water Content (RWC), as well as N content, was measured as ground truth. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis was used to build prediction models for RWC and N content. Then, their accuracy and robustness were compared according to the different N treatment datasets and different water treatment datasets, respectively. The results demonstrated that the PLS prediction for RWC using hyperspectral data was impacted by N stress difference (Ratio of Performance to Deviation; RPD from 0.87 to 2.27). Furthermore, the dataset with water and N dual stresses improved model accuracy and robustness (RPD from 1.69 to 2.64). Conversely, the PLS prediction for N content was found to be robust against water stress difference (RPD from 2.33 to 3.06). In conclusion, we suggest that water and N dual treatments can be helpful in building models with wide applicability and high accuracy for evaluating plant water status such as RWC.

TI Osteoporosis prediction in lumbar spine X-ray images using the
   multi-scale weighted fusion contextual transformer network
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE

DE Osteoporosis; Lumbar spine X-ray; Transformer-style; Multi -scale
   weighted fusion
AB Osteoporosis is a bone-related disease characterized by decreased bone density and mass, leading to brittle fractures. Osteoporosis assessment from radiographs using a deep learning algorithm has proven a low-cost alternative to the golden standard DXA. Due to the considerable noise and low contrast, automated diagnosis of osteoporosis in X-ray images still poses a significant challenge for traditional diagnostic methods. In this paper, an end-to-end transformer-style network was proposed, termed FCoTNet, to overcome the shortcoming of insufficient fusion of texture information and local features in the traditional CoTNet. To extract complementary geometric representations at each scale of the transformer module, we integrated parallel multi-scale feature extraction architectures in each unit layer of FCoTNet to utilize convolution to aggregate features from different receptive fields. Moreover, in order to extract small-scale texture features which were more critical to the diagnosis of osteoporosis in radiographs, larger fusion weights were assigned to the feature maps with small-size receptive fields. Afterward, the multi-scale global modeling was conducted by self-attention mechanism. The proposed model was first investigated on a private lumbar spine X-ray dataset with the 5-fold cross-validation strategy, obtaining an average accuracy of 78.29 & PLUSMN; 0.93 %, an average sensitivity of 69.72 & PLUSMN; 2.35 %, and an average specificity of 88.92 & PLUSMN; 0.67 % for the multi-classification of normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis categories. We then conducted a controlled trial with five orthopedic clinicians to evaluate the clinical value of the model. The average clinician's accuracy improved from 61.50 & PLUSMN; 10.79 % unaided to 80.00 & PLUSMN; 5.92 % aided (18.50 % improvement), sensitivity improved from 64.38 & PLUSMN; 8.07 % unaided to 83.31 & PLUSMN; 5.43 % aided (18.93 % improvement), and specificity improved from 80.11 & PLUSMN; 4.72 % unaided to 89.94 & PLUSMN; 3.82 % aided (9.83 % improvement). Meanwhile, the prediction consistency among clinicians significantly improved with the assistance of FCoTNet. Furthermore, the proposed model showed good robustness on an external test dataset. These investigations indicate that the proposed deep learning model achieves state-of-the-art performance for osteoporosis prediction, which substantially improves osteoporosis screening and reduced osteoporosis fractures.

AB Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are nowadays used in various applications for security, inspection and delivery among others. To operate in dynamic and complex environments efficiently demands an optimal path planning where multiple factors should be taken into account. In this paper, the multi-objective path planning problem of USV is formulated aiming to minimize the traveled distance maximizing in parallel the trajectory smoothness and energy efficiency. To address this multi-objective path planning problem with contradicting terms, the popular Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed enhanced with the proposed Fuzzy Pareto framework. In particular, ACO is used to solve the problem by finding the Pareto solutions optimizing each single objective. Then these solutions are evaluated via the Mamdani fuzzy inference system to identify the optimal one. The ranking of the solutions is based on the defuzzification values. A case study is performed in a simulation area based on Saronic Gulf topology. The results showed that depending the needs of an operation and the conditions of the area of operations (number of obstacles, currents, and distance from the initial to the target point), each objective can impact the path quality differently.

AB Associative system has attracted increasing attention for it can store basic information and then infer details to match perception with an efficient self-organization algorithm. However, the implementation of the associative system with the application of real-world data is relatively difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel biologically inspired auto-associative (BIAA) network to explore the structure, encoding and formation of associative memory as well as to extend the ability to real-world application. Our network is constructed by imitating the organization of the cortical minicolumns where each minicolumn contains plenty of parallel biological spiking neurons. To allow the network to learn and predict one symbol per theta cycle, we incorporate synaptic delay and theta oscillation into the neuron dynamic process. Subsequently, we design a sparse temporal population (STP) coding scheme that allows each input symbol to be represented as stable, unique, and easily recallable sparsely distributed representations. By combining associative learning dynamics with the STP coding, our network realizes efficient storage and inference in an ordered manner. Experimental results indicate that the proposed network successfully performs sequence retrieval from partial text and sequence recovery from distorted information. BIAA network provides new insight into introducing biologically inspired mechanisms into associative system and has enormous potential for hardware and software applications.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Virtual screening can accelerate drug discovery by identifying promising candidates for experimental evaluation. Machine learning is a powerful method for screening, as it can learn complex structure-property relationships from experimental data and make rapid predictions over virtual libraries. Molecules inherently exist as a three-dimensional ensemble and their biological action typically occurs through supramolecular recognition. However, most deep learning approaches to molecular property prediction use a 2D graph representation as input, and in some cases a single 3D conformation. Here we investigate how the 3D information of multiple conformers, traditionally known as 4D information in the cheminformatics community, can improve molecular property prediction in deep learning models. We introduce multiple deep learning models that expand upon key architectures such as ChemProp and SchNet, adding elements such as multiple-conformer inputs and conformer attention. We then benchmark the performance trade-offs of these models on 2D, 3D and 4D representations in the prediction of drug activity using a large training set of geometrically resolved molecules. The new architectures perform significantly better than 2D models, but their performance is often just as strong with a single conformer as with many. We also find that 4D deep learning models learn interpretable attention weights for each conformer.

AB Traditional sequence recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) have the defect of long time dependence in the prediction of time series, resulting in their poor generalization ability. Moreover, it is required to traverse the whole training data set to realize supervised learning by SRNNs, which increases the time complexity and leads to their low prediction accuracy and high computation cost in the residual life prediction of space rolling bearings in the ground simulated space environment. In view of this, a novel SRNN named variational eligibility trace meta-reinforcement recurrent network (VETMRRN) is proposed for achieving higher residual life prediction accuracy and lower computation cost. In the proposed VETMRRN, a new sequence recurrent network structure is constructed to increase the memory amount of historical information, thus improving the long-term memory capacity of VETMRRN. Then, a hyperparameter self-initialization meta-learning network with an oracle gate mechanism is designed to self-initialize the hyperparameters of VETMRRN for fast determination of the optimal review sequence length. Hence, VETMRRN can adapt to different input sequence lengths and avoid the defect of long time dependence of traditional SRNNs. Furthermore, a variational auto-encoding meta policy gradient learning algorithm with an eligibility trace operator is designed to improve the training speed and enhance the global optimization effect for VETMRRN parameters. Based on the above advantages of VETMRRN, a new residual life prediction method of space rolling bearings in the ground simulated space environment is proposed. Firstly, the time-frequency fusion features are extracted by Shapely-value feature fusion from the vibration acceleration data of space rolling bearing as the performance degradation features. Then, the performance degradation features are input into VETMRRN to predict the performance degradation feature trends of space rolling bearings. Finally, a Weibull-distribution reliability model is established based on the performance degradation feature trend values to predict the residual life of space rolling bearings. The effectiveness of the proposed VETMRRN-based prediction method is verified by the vibration acceleration data collected from the self-built vibration monitoring platform of space rolling bearings in the ground simulated space environment. The results indicate that compared to traditional SRNNs, deep sparse auto-encoding neural network (DSAE-NN), and multi-kernel least-square support vector machine (MK-LSSVM), the proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computation cost in the residual life prediction of space rolling bearings. In the future, the generalization performance of VETMRRN still needs to be further improved. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is challenging to introduce an optimization method to improve the operation performance of wastewater treatment process (WWTP) on account of its high energy consumption and poor water quality characteristics. In this paper, an improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) based on grid density search and elite guidance (GDSEG-SPEA2) is proposed for multi-objective operation optimization of WWTP. First, the external archive is divided by an improved adaptive grid method to determine the distribution density of the solutions, and a neighborhood circle strategy as well as a mixed perturbation strategy are designed to search the neighborhood of sparse and crowded solutions, resulting in a more uniformly distributed Pareto front. Then, in order to avoid SPEA2 falling into local optimum after adding the neighborhood search strategies, the crossover and mutation operations based on individual information are proposed to generate new individuals. Finally, an elite guidance strategy, in which the poor-performing individuals of the population learn from the best-performing individuals to update their positions, is introduced into the algorithm to improve convergence. The test function verification shows that the proposed algorithm can obtain the Pareto front with better distribution and convergence than other existing algorithms. The operation optimization control experiment of WWTP shows that the proposed algorithm can better purify water quality and reduce more energy consumption on the premise of ensuring that effluent quality meets the discharge standards, which is better than other optimization algorithms in comparison.

AB Person re-identification (Re-ID) subject to loss of detailed information (sacrificing certain intricate body details) in samples caused by conventional regularization algorithms and degraded cross-domain performance due to limited generalization capacity is a challenging task. The majority of the existing research efforts address this problem either for attention regularization or cross-domain task, but neglect to explore a powerful framework to consider solving both cases simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, this paper develops an efficient semi-supervised person Re-ID network with Grad-CAM consistency regularization and weakening of random erasing features (GW-Net) to explore rich features and expect non-degraded performance in cross-domain con-dition. Specifically, a Grad-CAM consistency regularization (GCCR) module is designed to capture detailed in-formation by using Grad-CAM for consistency regularization, thereby enhancing the capacity of intra-class feature mining. Secondly, a weakening of random erasing features (WREF) module is presented to reduce the impact of erased regions on texture features, thereby maintaining the performance on the general source domain while preventing performance degradation in the target domain. Thirdly, a Grad-CAM consistency regularization loss is introduced to enable our model to maintain consistency between Grad-CAM results of the unlabeled and its augmented images. Meanwhile, a feature consistency loss is reported to keep consistency between features of unlabeled samples. Finally, sufficient experiments are carried out on three representative datasets, which vali-date the efficacy and meliority of our presented approach over state-of-the-art methods.

AB A proof procedure, in the spirit of the sequent calculus, is proposed to check the validity of entailments between Separation Logic formulas combining inductively defined predicates denoting structures of bounded tree width and theory reasoning. The calculus is sound and complete, in the sense that a sequent is valid iff it admits a (possibly infinite) proof tree. We also show that the procedure terminates in the two following cases: (i) When the inductive rules that define the predicates occurring on the left-hand side of the entailment terminate, in which case the proof tree is always finite. (ii) When the theory is empty, in which case every valid sequent admits a rational proof tree, where the total number of pairwise distinct sequents occurring in the proof tree is doubly exponential w.r.t. the size of the end-sequent.

AB Neural networks implemented in memristor-based hardware can provide fast and efficient in-memory computation, but traditional learning methods such as error back-propagation are hardly feasible in it. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are highly promising in this regard, as their weights can be changed locally in a self-organized manner without the demand for high-precision changes calculated with the use of information almost from the entire network. This problem is rather relevant for solving control tasks with neural-network reinforcement learning methods, as those are highly sensitive to any source of stochasticity in a model initialization, training, or decision-making procedure. This paper presents an online reinforcement learning algorithm in which the change of connection weights is carried out after processing each environment state during interaction-with-environment data generation. Another novel feature of the algorithm is that it is applied to SNNs with memristor-based STDP-like learning rules. The plasticity functions are obtained from real memristors based on poly-p-xylylene and CoFeBLiNbO3 nanocomposite, which were experimentally assembled and analyzed. The SNN is comprised of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Environmental states are encoded by the timings of input spikes, and the control action is decoded by the first spike. The proposed learning algorithm solves the Cart-Pole benchmark task successfully. This result could be the first step towards implementing a real-time agent learning procedure in a continuous-time environment that can be run on neuromorphic systems with memristive synapses.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A good weight initialization is crucial to accelerate the convergence of the weights in a neural network. However, training a neural network is still time-consuming, despite recent advances in weight initialization approaches. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for the weight initialization in the last layer of a neural network. We first derive analytically a tight constraint on the weights that accelerates the convergence of the weights during the back-propagation algorithm. We then use linear regression and Lagrange multipliers to analytically derive the optimal initial weights and initial bias of the last layer, that minimize the initial training loss given the derived tight constraint. We also show that the restrictive assumption of traditional weight initialization algorithms that the expected value of the weights is zero is redundant for our approach. We first apply our proposed weight initialization approach to a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the Remaining Useful Life of aircraft engines. The initial training and validation loss are relatively small, the weights do not get stuck in a local optimum, and the convergence of the weights is accelerated. We compare our approach with several benchmark strategies. Compared to the best performing stateof-the-art initialization strategy (Kaiming initialization), our approach needs 34% less epochs to reach the same validation loss. We also apply our approach to ResNets for the CIFAR-100 dataset, combined with transfer learning. Here, the initial accuracy is already at least 53%. This gives a faster weight convergence and a higher test accuracy than the benchmark strategies.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Attention mechanisms have been widely adopted for image captioning because of their powerful performance. In this paper, we propose a Mask Captioning Network (MaC) consisting of an object layer and a background layer to capture the objects and scenes of an image to generate a sentence. To this end, we leverage the Mask RCNN to detect salient regions at the pixel level instead of a bounding box in the object layer. Meanwhile, in the background layer, a CNN model is used to encode the scene features. In addition, MaC is implemented in both LSTM-based and Transformer-based image captioning architectures. We introduce a mask-guided transformer encoder with additional features to enhance the model. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms (with a much richer sentence) baseline models and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets.

ID RECOGNITION
AB The ability of music to induce emotions has been arousing a lot of interest in recent years, especially due to the boom in music streaming platforms and the use of automatic music recommenders. Music Emotion Recognition approaches are based on combining multiple audio features extracted from digital audio samples and different machine learning techniques. In these approaches, neuroscience results on musical emotion perception are not considered. The main goal of this research is to facilitate the automatic subtitling of music. The authors approached the problem of automatic musical emotion detection in movie soundtracks considering these characteristics and using scientific musical databases, which have become a reference in neuroscience research. In the experiments, the Constant-Q-Transform spectrograms, the ones that best represent the relationships between musical tones from the point of view of human perception, are combined with Convolutional Neural Networks. Results show an efficient emotion classification model for 2-second musical audio fragments representative of intense basic feelings of happiness, sadness, and fear. Those emotions are the most interesting to be identified in the case of movie music captioning. The quality metrics have demonstrated that the results of the different models differ significantly and show no homogeneity. Finally, these results pave the way for an accessible and automatic captioning of music, which could automatically identify the emotional intent of the different segments of the movie soundtrack.

AB Prior studies have noted the importance of ceiling temperature distribution prediction of tunnel fires. To overcome the limitations of precise modeling difficulties for model-driven methods and biased toward the convergence for the data-driven methods due to loss of physical interpretations, a hybrid model-driven and data-driven fusion algorithm is established to predict ceiling temperature distribution in tunnel fires based on dimensional analysis method and ant colony optimization algorithm. Thus, full-scale tunnel fire experiments with different ventilation speeds are conducted to support the algorithm. In contrast to the experimental data as well as the known theoretical model, data-driven back propagation neural network algorithm and hybrid ant colony optimization and back propagation neural network algorithm, the effectiveness and ability of the algorithm are verified, which can be used for the tunnel fire prediction.

ID MODEL
AB Target-based sentiment analysis (TBSA) is one of the most important NLP research topics for widespread applications. However, the task is challenging, especially when the targets contain multiple words or do not exist in the sequences. Conventional approaches cannot accurately extract the (target, sentiment) pairs due to the limitations of the fixed end-to-end architecture design. In this paper, we propose a framework named O-2-Bert, which consists of Opinion target extraction (OTE-Bert) and Opinion sentiment classification (OSC-Bert) to complete the task in two stages. More specifically, we divide the OTE-Bert into three modules. First, an entity number prediction module predicts the number of entities in a sequence, even in an extreme situation where no entities are contained. Afterwards, with predicted number of entities, an entity starting annotation module is responsible for predicting their starting positions. Finally, an entity length prediction module predicts the lengths of these entities, and thus, accomplishes target extraction. In OSC-Bert, the sentiment polarities of extracted targets from OTE-Bert. According to the characteristics of BERT encoders, our framework can be adapted to short English sequences without domain limitations. For other languages, our approach might work through altering the tokenization. Experimental results on the SemEval 2014-16 benchmarks show that the proposed model achieves competitive performances on both domains (restaurants and laptops) and both tasks (target extraction and sentiment classification), with F1-score as evaluated metrics. Specifically, OTE-Bert achieves 84.63%, 89.20%, 83.16%, and 86.88% F1 scores for target extraction, while OSCBert achieves 82.90%, 80.73%, 76.94%, and 83.58% F1 scores for sentiment classification, on the chosen benchmarks. The statistics validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and the new "two-stage paradigm". In future work, we will explore more possibilities of the new paradigm on other NLP tasks.
