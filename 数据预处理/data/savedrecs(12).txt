AB Convolution on 3D point clouds is widely researched yet far from perfect in geometric deep learning. The traditional wisdom of convolution characterises feature correspondences indistinguishably among 3D points, arising an intrinsic limitation of poor distinctive feature learning. In this article, we propose Adaptive Graph Convolution (AGConv) for wide applications of point cloud analysis. AGConv generates adaptive kernels for points according to their dynamically learned features. Compared with the solution of using fixed/isotropic kernels, AGConv improves the flexibility of point cloud convolutions, effectively and precisely capturing the diverse relations between points from different semantic parts. Unlike the popular attentional weight schemes, AGConv implements the adaptiveness inside the convolution operation instead of simply assigning different weights to the neighboring points. Extensive evaluations clearly show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts of point cloud classification and segmentation on various benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, AGConv can flexibly serve more point cloud analysis approaches to boost their performance. To validate its flexibility and effectiveness, we explore AGConv-based paradigms of completion, denoising, upsampling, registration and circle extraction, which are comparable or even superior to their competitors.

AB Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs has been a significant hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, in this paper we study the attention mechanisms, which can help human focus on important information. We present our idea of attention in SNNs with a multi-dimensional attention module, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well as spatial dimension separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing neuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane potentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response. Extensive experimental results on event-based action recognition and image classification datasets demonstrate that attention facilitates vanilla SNNs to achieve sparser spiking firing, better performance, and energy efficiency concurrently. In particular, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92% and 77.08% on ImageNet-1 K with single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in SNNs. Comparedwith counterpart Res-ANN-104, the performance gap becomes -0.95/+0.21 percent and the energy efficiency is 31.8x/7.4x. To analyze the effectiveness of attention SNNs, we theoretically prove that the spiking degradation or the gradient vanishing, which usually holds in general SNNs, can be resolved by introducing the block dynamical isometry theory. We also analyze the efficiency of attention SNNs based on our proposed spiking response visualization method. Our work lights up SNN's potential as a general backbone to support various applications in the field of SNNresearch, with a great balance between effectiveness and energy efficiency.

DT Article
DE Cascaded inference; deep convolutional neural network; non-local
   similarity; self-attention; video deblurring
AB We present compact and effective deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by exploring properties of videos for video deblurring. Motivated by the non-uniform blur property that not all the pixels of the frames are blurry, we develop a CNN to integrate a temporal sharpness prior (TSP) for removing blur in videos. The TSP exploits sharp pixels from adjacent frames to facilitate the CNN for better frame restoration. Observing that the motion field is related to latent frames instead of blurry ones in the image formation model, we develop an effective cascaded training approach to solve the proposed CNN in an end-to-end manner. As videos usually contain similar contents within and across frames, we propose a non-local similarity mining approach based on a self-attention method with the propagation of global features to constrain CNNs for frame restoration. We show that exploring the domain knowledge of videos can make CNNs more compact and efficient, where the CNN with the non-local spatial-temporal similarity is 3xsmaller than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of model parameters while its performance gains are at least 1 dB higher in terms of PSNRs. Extensive experimental results showthat ourmethod performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on benchmarks and real-world videos.

DE Task clustering; task representation based on learning path; task-aware
   meta-learning
ID ALGORITHMS
AB To enable effective learning of new tasks with only a few examples, meta-learning acquires common knowledge from the existing tasks with a globally shared meta-learner. To further address the problem of task heterogeneity, recent developments balance between customization and generalization by incorporating task clustering to generate task-aware modulation to be applied to the global meta-learner. However, these methods learn task representation mostly from the features ofinput data, while the task-specific optimization process with respect to the base-learner is often neglected. In this work, we propose a Clustered Task-Aware Meta-Learning (CTML) framework with task representation learned from both features and learning paths. We first conduct rehearsed task learning from the common initialization, and collect a set of geometric quantities that adequately describes this learning path. By inputting this set of values into a meta path learner, we automatically abstract path representation optimized for downstream clustering and modulation. Aggregating the path and feature representations results in an improved task representation. To further improve inference efficiency, we devise a shortcut tunnel to bypass the rehearsed learning process at a meta-testing time. Extensive experiments on two real-world application domains: few-shot image classification and cold-start recommendation demonstrate the superiority of CTML compared to state-of-the-art methods. We provide our code at https://github.com/didiya0825.

DE Moire pattern; signal aliasing; layer separation
AB Removing the undesired moire patterns from images capturing the contents displayed on screens is of increasing research interest, as the need for recording and sharing the instant information conveyed by the screens is growing. Previous demoireing methods provide limited investigations into the formation process of moire patterns to exploit moire-specific priors for guiding the learning of demoireing models. In this paper, we investigate the moire pattern formation process from the perspective of signal aliasing, and correspondingly propose a coarse-to-fine disentangling demoireing framework. In this framework, we first disentangle the moire pattern layer and the clean image with alleviated ill-posedness based on the derivation of ourmoire image formation model. Then we refine the demoireing results exploiting both the frequency domain features and edge attention, considering moire patterns' property on spectrum distribution and edge intensity revealed in our aliasing based analysis. Experiments on several datasets showthat the proposedmethod performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed method is validated to adapt well to different data sources and scales, especially on the high-resolution moire images.

AB With convolution operations, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good at extracting local features but experience difficulty to capture global representations. With cascaded self-attention modules, vision transformers can capture long-distance feature dependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network structure, termed Conformer, to take both advantages of convolution operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced representation learning. Conformer roots in feature coupling of CNN local features and transformer global representations under different resolutions in an interactive fashion. Conformer adopts a dual structure so that local details and global dependencies are retained to the maximum extent. We also propose a Conformer-based detector (ConformerDet), which learns to predict and refine object proposals, by performing region-level feature coupling in an augmented cross-attention fashion. Experiments on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets validate Conformer's superiority for visual recognition and object detection, demonstrating its potential to be a general backbone network.

AB We present a method for reconstructing accurate and consistent 3D hands from a monocular video. We observe that the detected 2D hand keypoints and the image texture provide important cues about the geometry and texture of the 3D hand, which can reduce or even eliminate the requirement on 3D hand annotation. Accordingly, in this work, we propose S(2)HAND, a self-supervised 3D hand reconstruction model, that can jointly estimate pose, shape, texture, and the camera viewpoint from a single RGB input through the supervision of easily accessible 2D detected keypoints. We leverage the continuous hand motion information contained in the unlabeled video data and explore S(2)HAND(V), which uses a set of weights shared S(2)HAND to process each frame and exploits additional motion, texture, and shape consistency constrains to obtain more accurate hand poses, and more consistent shapes and textures. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our self-supervised method produces comparable hand reconstruction performance compared with the recent full-supervised methods in single-frame as input setup, and notably improves the reconstruction accuracy and consistency when using the video training data.

TI Content-Aware Warping for View Synthesis

AB Existing image-based rendering methods usually adopt depth-based image warping operation to synthesize novel views. In this paper, we reason the essential limitations of the traditional warping operation to be the limited neighborhood and only distance-based interpolation weights. To this end, we propose content-aware warping, which adaptively learns the interpolation weights for pixels of a relatively large neighborhood from their contextual information via a lightweight neural network. Based on this learnable warping module, we propose a new end-to-end learningbased framework for novel view synthesis from a set of input source views, in which two additional modules, namely confidence-based blending and feature-assistant spatial refinement, are naturally proposed to handle the occlusion issue and capture the spatial correlation among pixels of the synthesized view, respectively. Besides, we also propose a weight-smoothness loss term to regularize the network. Experimental results on light field datasets with wide baselines and multi-view datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

TI ContextLoc plus plus : A Unified Context Model for Temporal Action
   Localization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Local and global contexts; multi-scale represent- ation; temporal action
   localization
AB Effectively tackling the problem of temporal action localization (TAL) necessitates a visual representation that jointly pursues two confounding goals, i.e., fine-grained discrimination for temporal localization and sufficient visual invariance for action classification. We address this challenge by enriching the local, global and multi-scale contexts in the popular two-stage temporal localization framework. Our proposed model, dubbed ContextLoc++, can be divided into three sub-networks: L-Net, G-Net, and M-Net. L-Net enriches the local context via fine-grained modeling of snippet-level features, which is formulated as a query-and-retrieval process. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal snippet-level features, functioning as keys and values, are fused by temporal gating. G-Net enriches the global context via higher-level modeling of the video-level representation. In addition, we introduce a novel context adaptation module to adapt the global context to different proposals. M-Net further fuses the local and global contexts with multi-scale proposal features. Specially, proposal-level features from multi-scale video snippets can focus on different action characteristics. Short-term snippets with fewer frames pay attention to the action details while long-term snippets with more frames focus on the action variations. Experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets validate the efficacy of our method against existing state-of-the-art TAL algorithms.

TI Contextual Instance Decoupling for Instance-Level Human Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Contextual instance decoupling; instance-level human analysis;
   multi-person part segmentation; multi-person pose estimation;
   multi-person segmentation
AB One fundamental challenge of instance-level human analysis is to decouple instances in crowded scenes, where multiple persons are overlapped with each other. This paper proposes the Contextual Instance Decoupling (CID), which presents a new pipeline of decoupling persons for multi-person instance-level analysis. Instead of relying on person bounding boxes to spatially differentiate persons, CID decouples persons in an image into multiple instance-aware feature maps. Each of those feature maps is hence adopted to infer instance-level cues for a specific person, e.g., keypoints, instance mask or part segmentation masks. Compared with bounding box detection, CID is differentiable and robust to detection errors. Decoupling persons into different feature maps also allows to isolate distractions from other persons, and explore context cues at scales larger than the bounding box size. Extensive experiments on various tasks including multi-person pose estimation, person foreground segmentation, and part segmentation, show that CID consistently outperforms previous methods in both accuracy and efficiency. For instance, it achieves 71.3% AP on CrowdPose in multi-person pose estimation, outperforming the recent single-stageDEKRby 5.6%, the bottom-up CenterAttention by 3.7%, and the top-down JC-SPPE by 5.3%. This advantage sustains on multi-person segmentation and part segmentation tasks.

ID RAIN STREAKS REMOVAL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECOMPOSITION
AB Image deraining is a challenging task since rain streaks have the characteristics of a spatially long structure and have a complex diversity. Existing deep learning-based methods mainly construct the deraining networks by stacking vanilla convolutional layers with local relations, and can only handle a single dataset due to catastrophic forgetting, resulting in a limited performance and insufficient adaptability. To address these issues, we propose a new image deraining framework to effectively explore nonlocal similarity, and to continuously learn on multiple datasets. Specifically, we first design a patchwise hypergraph convolutional module, which aims to better extract the nonlocal properties with higher-order constraints on the data, to construct a new backbone and to improve the deraining performance. Then, to achieve better generalizability and adaptability in real-world scenarios, we propose a biological brain-inspired continual learning algorithm. By imitating the plasticity mechanism of brain synapses during the learning and memory process, our continual learning process allows the network to achieve a subtle stability-plasticity tradeoff. This it can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting and enables a single network to handle multiple datasets. Compared with the competitors, our new deraining network with unified parameters attains a state-of-the-art performance on seen synthetic datasets and has a significantly improved generalizability on unseen real rainy images.

DE Contrastive learning; kernel function; kernel method; multi-view
   clustering; multiple kernel clustering
AB Kernel method is a proven technique in multi-view learning. It implicitly defines a Hilbert space where samples can be linearly separated. Most kernel-based multi-view learning algorithms compute a kernel function aggregating and compressing the views into a single kernel. However, existing approaches compute the kernels independently for each view. This ignores complementary information across views and thus may result in a bad kernel choice. In contrast, we propose the ContrastiveMulti-view Kernel - a novel kernel function based on the emerging contrastive learning framework. The Contrastive Multi-view Kernel implicitly embeds the views into a joint semantic space where all of them resemble each other while promoting to learn diverse views. We validate the method's effectiveness in a large empirical study. It is worth noting that the proposed kernel functions share the types and parameters with traditional ones, making them fully compatible with existing kernel theory and application. On this basis, we also propose a contrastive multi-view clustering framework and instantiate itwith multiple kernel k-means, achieving a promising performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore kernel generation in multi-view setting and the first approach to use contrastive learning for a multi-view kernel learning.

TI CoReS: Compatible Representations via Stationarity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Compatible learning; deep convolutional neural network; fixed
   classifiers; representation learning
AB Compatible features enable the direct comparison of old and new learned features allowing to use them interchangeably over time. In visual search systems, this eliminates the need to extract new features from the gallery-set when the representation model is upgraded with novel data. This has a big value in real applications as re-indexing the gallery-set can be computationally expensive when the gallery-set is large, or even infeasible due to privacy or other concerns of the application. In this paper, we propose CoReS, a new training procedure to learn representations that are compatible with those previously learned, grounding on the stationarity of the features as provided by fixed classifiers based on polytopes. With this solution, classes are maximally separated in the representation space and maintain their spatial configuration stationary as new classes are added, so that there is no need to learn any mappings between representations nor to impose pairwise training with the previously learned model. We demonstrate that our training procedure largely outperforms the current state of the art and is particularly effective in the case of multiple upgrades of the training-set, which is the typical case in real applications.

TI CP3: Unifying Point Cloud Completion by Pretrain-Prompt-Predict Paradigm

AB Point cloud completion aims to predict complete shape from its partial observation. Current approaches mainly consist of generation and refinement stages in a coarse-to-fine style. However, the generation stage often lacks robustness to tackle different incomplete variations, while the refinement stage blindly recovers point clouds without the semantic awareness. To tackle these challenges, we unify point cloud Completion by a generic PretrainPrompt-Predict paradigm, namely CP3. Inspired by prompting approaches from NLP, we creatively reinterpret point cloud generation and refinement as the prompting and predicting stages, respectively. Then, we introduce a concise self-supervised pretraining stage before prompting. It can effectively increase robustness of point cloud generation, by an Incompletion-Of-Incompletion (IOI) pretext task. Moreover, we develop a novel Semantic Conditional Refinement (SCR) network at the predicting stage. It can discriminatively modulate multi-scale refinement with the guidance of semantics. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our CP3 outperforms the state-of-the-artmethods with a large margin. code will be available at https://github.com/ MingyeXu/cp3.

TI Cross-Modal Retrieval With Partially Mismatched Pairs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Complementary contrastive learning; cross-modal retrieval; mismatched
   pairs
AB In this paper, we study a challenging but less-touched problem in cross-modal retrieval, i.e., partially mismatched pairs (PMPs). Specifically, in real-world scenarios, a huge number of multimedia data (e.g., the Conceptual Captions dataset) are collected from the Internet, and thus it is inevitable to wrongly treat some irrelevant cross-modal pairs as matched. Undoubtedly, such a PMP problem will remarkably degrade the cross-modal retrieval performance. To tackle this problem, we derive a unified theoretical Robust Cross-modal Learning framework (RCL) with an unbiased estimator of the cross-modal retrieval risk, which aims to endow the cross-modal retrieval methods with robustness against PMPs. In detail, our RCL adopts a novel complementary contrastive learning paradigm to address the following two challenges, i.e., the overfitting and underfitting issues. On the one hand, our method only utilizes the negative information which is much less likely false compared with the positive information, thus avoiding the overfitting issue to PMPs. However, these robust strategies could induce underfitting issues, thus making training models more difficult. On the other hand, to address the underfitting issue brought by weak supervision, we present to leverage of all available negative pairs to enhance the supervision contained in the negative information. Moreover, to further improve the performance, we propose to minimize the upper bounds of the risk to pay more attention to hard samples. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, we carry out comprehensive experiments on five widely-used benchmark datasets compared with nine state-of-the-art approaches w.r.t. the image-text and video-text retrieval tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/penghu-cs/RCL.

TI DAQE: Enhancing the Quality of Compressed Images by Exploiting the
   Inherent Characteristic of Defocus
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Compressed image; deep learning; image defocus; quality enhancement
ID DEPTH
AB Image defocus is inherent in the physics of image formation caused by the optical aberration of lenses, providing plentiful information on image quality. Unfortunately, existing quality enhancement approaches for compressed images neglect the inherent characteristic of defocus, resulting in inferior performance. This paper finds that in compressed images, significantly defocused regions have better compression quality, and two regions with different defocus values possess diverse texture patterns. These observations motivate our defocus-aware quality enhancement (DAQE) approach. Specifically, we propose a novel dynamic region-based deep learning architecture of the DAQE approach, which considers the regionwise defocus difference of compressed images in two aspects. (1) The DAQE approach employs fewer computational resources to enhance the quality of significantly defocused regions and more resources to enhance the quality of other regions; (2) The DAQE approach learns to separately enhance diverse texture patterns for regions with different defocus values, such that texture-specific enhancement can be achieved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our DAQE approach over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality enhancement and resource savings.

ID RECONSTRUCTION; REGULARIZATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Neural networks (NNs) have been widely applied in tomographic imaging through data-driven training and image processing. One of the main challenges in using NNs in real medical imaging is the requirement of massive amounts of training data - which are not always available in clinical practice. In this article, we demonstrate that, on the contrary, one can directly execute image reconstruction using NNs without training data. The key idea is to bring in the recently introduced deep image prior (DIP) andmerge it with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) reconstruction. DIP provides a novel approach to the regularization of EIT reconstruction problems by compelling the recovered image to be synthesized from a given NN architecture. Then, by relying on the NN's built-in back-propagation and the finite element solver, the conductivity distribution is optimized. Quantitative results based on simulation and experimental data show that the proposed method is an effective unsupervised approach capable of outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

AB For a classification task, we usually select an appropriate classifier via model selection. How to evaluate whether the chosen classifier is optimal? One can answer this question via Bayes error rate (BER). Unfortunately, estimating BER is a fundamental conundrum. Most existing BER estimators focus on giving the upper and lower bounds of the BER. However, evaluating whether the selected classifier is optimal based on these bounds is hard. In this article, we aim to learn the exact BER instead of bounds on BER. The core of our method is to transform the BER calculation problem into a noise recognition problem. Specifically, we define a type of noise called Bayes noise and prove that the proportion of Bayes noisy samples in a data set is statistically consistent with the BER of the data set. To recognize the Bayes noisy samples, we present a method consisting of two parts: selecting reliable samples based on percolation theory and then employing a label propagation algorithm to recognize the Bayes noisy samples based on the selected reliable samples. The superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing BER estimators is verified on extensive synthetic, benchmark, and image data sets.

DE Conditional image synthesis; GAN; semantic segmentation; unsupervised
   learning
AB Recently, unsupervised learning has made impressive progress on various tasks. Despite the dominance of discriminative models, increasing attention is drawn to representations learned by generative models and in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Previous works on the interpretation of GANs reveal that GANs encode semantics in feature maps in a linearly separable form. In this work, we further find that GAN's features can be well clustered with the linear separability assumption. We propose a novel clustering algorithm, named KLiSH, which leverages the linear separability to cluster GAN's features. KLiSH succeeds in extracting fine-grained semantics of GANs trained on datasets of various objects, e.g., car, portrait, animals, and so on. With KLiSH, we can sample images from GANs along with their segmentation masks and synthesize paired image-segmentation datasets. Using the synthesized datasets, we enable two downstream applications. First, we train semantic segmentation networks on these datasets and test them on real images, realizing unsupervised semantic segmentation. Second, we train image-to-image translation networks on the synthesized datasets, enabling semantic-conditional image synthesis without human annotations.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Common cross-validation (CV) methods like k-fold cross-validation or Monte Carlo cross-validation estimate the predictive performance of a learner by repeatedly training it on a large portion of the given data and testing it on the remaining data. These techniques have two major drawbacks. First, they can be unnecessarily slow on large datasets. Second, beyond an estimation of the final performance, they give almost no insights into the learning process of the validated algorithm. In this article, we present a new approach for validation based on learning curves (LCCV). Instead of creating train-test splits with a large portion of training data, LCCV iteratively increases the number of instances used for training. In the context of model selection, it discards models that are unlikely to become competitive. In a series of experiments on 75 datasets, we could show that in over 90% of the cases using LCCV leads to the same performance as using 5/10-fold CV while substantially reducing the runtime (median runtime reductions of over 50%); the performance using LCCV never deviated from CV by more than 2.5%.

ID ANDERSON ACCELERATION
AB Non-rigid 3D registration, which deforms a source 3D shape in a non-rigid way to align with a target 3D shape, is a classical problem in computer vision. Such problems can be challenging because of imperfect data (noise, outliers and partial overlap) and high degrees of freedom. Existing methods typically adopt the l(p) type robust norm to measure the alignment error and regularize the smoothness of deformation, and use a proximal algorithm to solve the resulting non-smooth optimization problem. However, the slow convergence of such algorithms limits their wide applications. In this paper, we propose a formulation for robust non-rigid registration based on a globally smooth robust norm for alignment and regularization, which can effectively handle outliers and partial overlaps. The problem is solved using the majorization-minimization algorithm, which reduces each iteration to a convex quadratic problem with a closed-form solution. We further apply Anderson acceleration to speed up the convergence of the solver, enabling the solver to run efficiently on devices with limited compute capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for non-rigid alignment between two shapes with outliers and partial overlaps, with quantitative evaluation showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of registration accuracy and computational speed.

AB One of the crucial issues in federated learning is how to develop efficient optimization algorithms. Most of the current ones require full device participation and/or impose strong assumptions for convergence. Different from the widely-used gradient descent-based algorithms, in this article, we develop an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is both computation- and communication-efficient, capable of combating the stragglers' effect, and convergent under mild conditions. Furthermore, it has high numerical performance compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms for federated learning.

AB Predicting drug synergy is critical to tailoring feasible drug combination treatment regimens for cancer patients. However, most of the existing computational methods only focus on data-rich cell lines, and hardly work on data-poor cell lines. To this end, here we proposed a novel few-shot drug synergy prediction method (called HyperSynergy) for data-poor cell lines by designing a prior-guided Hypernetwork architecture, in which the meta-generative network based on the task embedding of each cell line generates cell line dependent parameters for the drug synergy prediction network. In HyperSynergy model, we designed a deep Bayesian variational inference model to infer the prior distribution over the task embedding to quickly update the task embedding with a few labeled drug synergy samples, and presented a three-stage learning strategy to train HyperSynergy for quickly updating the prior distribution by a few labeled drug synergy samples of each data-poor cell line. Moreover, we proved theoretically that HyperSynergy aims to maximize the lower bound of log-likelihood of the marginal distribution over each data-poor cell line. The experimental results show that our HyperSynergy outperforms other state-of-the-art methods not only on data-poor cell lines with a few samples (e.g., 10, 5, 0), but also on data-rich cell lines.

AB Point clouds are characterized by irregularity and unstructuredness, which pose challenges in efficient data exploitation and discriminative feature extraction. In this paper, we present an unsupervised deep neural architecture called Flattening-Net to represent irregular 3D point clouds of arbitrary geometry and topology as a completely regular 2D point geometry image (PGI) structure, in which coordinates of spatial points are captured in colors of image pixels. Intuitively, Flattening-Net implicitly approximates a locally smooth 3D-to-2D surface flattening process while effectively preserving neighborhood consistency. As a generic representation modality, PGI inherently encodes the intrinsic property of the underlying manifold structure and facilitates surface-style point feature aggregation. To demonstrate its potential, we construct a unified learning framework directly operating on PGIs to achieve diverse types of high-level and low-level downstream applications driven by specific task networks, including classification, segmentation, reconstruction, and upsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods perform favorably against the current state-of-the-art competitors.

AB We present Free-HeadGAN, a person-generic neural talking head synthesis system. We show that modeling faces with sparse 3D facial landmarks is sufficient for achieving state-of-the-art generative performance, without relying on strong statistical priors of the face, such as 3D Morphable Models. Apart from 3D pose and facial expressions, our method is capable of fully transferring the eye gaze, from a driving actor to a source identity. Our complete pipeline consists of three components: a canonical 3D key-point estimator that regresses 3D pose and expression-related deformations, a gaze estimation network and a generator that is built upon the architecture of HeadGAN. We further experiment with an extension of our generator to accommodate few-shot learning using an attention mechanism, in case multiple source images are available. Compared to recent methods for reenactment and motion transfer, our system achieves higher photo-realism combined with superior identity preservation, while offering explicit gaze control.

DE Calibration; Prototypes; Task analysis; Measurement; Noise measurement;
   Adaptation models; Training; Few-shot learning; self-supervised

AB Robust few-shot learning (RFSL), which aims to address noisy labels in few-shot learning, has recently gained considerable attention. Existing RFSL methods are based on the assumption that the noise comes from known classes (in-domain), which is inconsistent with many real-world scenarios where the noise does not belong to any known classes (out-of-domain). We refer to this more complex scenario as open-world few-shot learning (OFSL), where in-domain and out-of-domain noise simultaneously exists in few-shot datasets. To address the challenging problem, we propose a unified framework to implement comprehensive calibration from instance to metric. Specifically, we design a dual-networks structure composed of a contrastive network and a meta network to respectively extract feature-related intra-class information and enlarged inter-class variations. For instance-wise calibration, we present a novel prototype modification strategy to aggregate prototypes with intra-class and inter-class instance reweighting. For metric-wise calibration, we present a novel metric to implicitly scale the per-class prediction by fusing two spatial metrics respectively constructed by the two networks. In this way, the impact of noise in OFSL can be effectively mitigated from both feature space and label space. Extensive experiments on various OFSL settings demonstrate the robustness and superiority of our method. Our source codes is available at https://github.com/anyuexuan/IDEAL.

AB Deep learning for change detection is one of the current hot topics in the field of remote sensing. However, most end-to-end networks are proposed for supervised change detection, and unsupervised change detection models depend on traditional pre-detection methods. Therefore, we proposed a fully convolutional change detection framework with generative adversarial network, to unify unsupervised, weakly supervised, regional supervised, and fully supervised change detection tasks into one end-to-end framework. A basic Unet segmentor is used to obtain change detection map, an image-to-image generator is implemented to model the spectral and spatial variation between multi-temporal images, and a discriminator for changed and unchanged is proposed for modeling the semantic changes in weakly and regional supervised change detection task. The iterative optimization of segmentor and generator can build an end-to-end network for unsupervised change detection, the adversarial process between segmentor and discriminator can provide the solutions for weakly and regional supervised change detection, the segmentor itself can be trained for fully supervised task. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of the propsed framework in unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection. This article provides new theorical definitions for unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection tasks with the proposed framework, and shows great potentials in exploring end-to-end network for remote sensing change detection (https://github.com/Cwuwhu/FCD-GAN-pytorch).

AB Neural networks often make predictions relying on the spurious correlations from the datasets rather than the intrinsic properties of the task of interest, facing with sharp degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. Existing de-bias learning frameworks try to capture specific dataset bias by annotations but they fail to handle complicated OOD scenarios. Others implicitly identify the dataset bias by special design low capability biased models or losses, but they degrade when the training and testing data are from the same distribution. In this paper, we propose a General Greedy De-bias learning framework (GGD), which greedily trains the biased models and base model. The base model is encouraged to focus on examples that are hard to solve with biased models, thus remaining robust against spurious correlations in the test stage. GGD largely improves models' OOD generalization ability on various tasks, but sometimes over-estimates the bias level and degrades on the in-distribution test. We further re-analyze the ensemble process of GGD and introduce the Curriculum Regularization inspired by curriculum learning, which achieves a good trade-off between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution performance. Extensive experiments on image classification, adversarial question answering, and visual question answering demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. GGD can learn a more robust base model under the settings of both task-specific biased models with prior knowledge and self-ensemble biased model without prior knowledge.

AB We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud registration. Recent keypoint-free methods have shown great potential through bypassing the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult to do especially in low-overlap scenarios. They seek correspondences over downsampled superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer, or GeoTransformer for short, to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it invariant to rigid transformation and robust in low-overlap cases. The simplistic design attains surprisingly high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of alignment transformation, leading to 100 times acceleration. Extensive experiments on rich benchmarks encompassing indoor, outdoor, synthetic, multiway and non-rigid demonstrate the efficacy of GeoTransformer. Notably, our method improves the inlier ratio by 18 similar to 31 percentage points and the registration recall by over 7 points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

AB Previous works for LiDAR-based 3D object detection mainly focus on the single-frame paradigm. In this paper, we propose to detect 3D objects by exploiting temporal information in multiple frames, i.e., point cloud videos. We empirically categorize the temporal information into short-term and long-term patterns. To encode the short-term data, we present a Grid Message Passing Network (GMPNet), which considers each grid (i.e., the grouped points) as a node and constructs a k-NN graph with the neighbor grids. To update features for a grid, GMPNet iteratively collects information from its neighbors, thus mining the motion cues in grids from nearby frames. To further aggregate long-term frames, we propose an Attentive Spatiotemporal Transformer GRU (AST-GRU), which contains a Spatial Transformer Attention (STA) module and a Temporal Transformer Attention (TTA) module. STA and TTA enhance the vanilla GRU to focus on small objects and better align moving objects. Our overall framework supports both online and offline video object detection in point clouds. We implement our algorithm based on prevalent anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. Evaluation results on the challenging nuScenes benchmark show superior performance of our method, achieving first on the leaderboard (at the time of paper submission) without any "bells and whistles." Our source code is available at https://github.com/shenjianbing/GMP3D.

AB Multi-dimensional prediction models of the pandemic diseases should be constructed in a way to reflect their peculiar epidemiological characters. In this paper, a graph theory-based constrained multi-dimensional (CM) mathematical and meta-heuristic algorithms (MA) are formed to learn the unknown parameters of a large-scale epidemiological model. The specified parameter signs and the coupling parameters of the sub-models constitute the constraints of the optimization problem. In addition, magnitude constraints on the unknown parameters are imposed to proportionally weight the input-output data importance. To learn these parameters, a gradient-based CM recursive least square (CM-RLS) algorithm, and three search-based MAs; namely, the CM particle swarm optimization (CM-PSO), the CM success history-based adaptive differential evolution (CM-SHADE), and the CM-SHADEWO enriched with the whale optimization (WO) algorithms are constructed. The traditional SHADE algorithm was the winner of the 2018 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation (CEC) and its versions in this paper are modified to create more certain parameter search spaces. The results obtained under the equal conditions show that the mathematical optimization algorithm CM-RLS outperforms the MA algorithms, which is expected since it uses the available gradient information. However, the search-based CM-SHADEWO algorithm is able to capture the dominant character of the CM optimization solution and produce satisfactory estimates in the presence of the hard constraints, uncertainties and lack of gradient information.

AB This paper studies a practical domain adaptive (DA) semantic segmentation problem where only pseudo-labeled target data is accessible through a black-box model. Due to the domain gap and label shift between two domains, pseudo-labeled target data contains mixed closed-set and open-set label noises. In this paper, we propose a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions in DA semantic segmentation, and leverage SimT to handle open-set label noise and enable novel target recognition. When handling open-set noises, we formulate the problem as estimation of SimT. By exploiting computational geometry analysis and properties of segmentation, we design four complementary regularizers, i.e., volume regularization, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, and semantic constraint, to approximate the true SimT. Specifically, volume regularization minimizes the volume of simplex formed by rows of the non-square SimT, ensuring outputs of model to fit into the ground truth label distribution. To compensate for the lack of open-set knowledge, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, and semantic constraint are devised to enable the modeling of open-set noise distribution. The estimated SimT is utilized to correct noise issues in pseudo labels and promote the generalization ability of segmentation model on target domain data. In the task of novel target recognition, we first propose closed-to-open label correction (C2OLC) to explicitly derive the supervision signal for open-set classes by exploiting the estimated SimT, and then advance a semantic relation (SR) loss that harnesses the inter-class relation to facilitate the open-set class sample recognition in target domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be flexibly plugged into existing DA methods to boost both closed-set and open-set class performance.

AB With the advent of Deep Learning (DL), Super-Resolution (SR) has also become a thriving research area. However, despite promising results, the field still faces challenges that require further research, e.g., allowing flexible upsampling, more effective loss functions, and better evaluation metrics. We review the domain of SR in light of recent advances and examine state-of-the-art models such as diffusion (DDPM) and transformer-based SR models. We critically discuss contemporary strategies used in SR and identify promising yet unexplored research directions. We complement previous surveys by incorporating the latest developments in the field, such as uncertainty-driven losses, wavelet networks, neural architecture search, novel normalization methods, and the latest evaluation techniques. We also include several visualizations for the models and methods throughout each chapter to facilitate a global understanding of the trends in the field. This review ultimately aims at helping researchers to push the boundaries of DL applied to SR.

However, there still exist two main problems to be solved: (1) from the perspective of mathematical representations, the differences among edges, corners, and blobs have not been convincingly explained and the relationships among the amplitude response, scale factor, and filtering orientation for interest points have not been thoroughly explained; (2) the existing design mechanism for interest point detection does not show how to accurately obtain intensity variation information on corners and blobs. In this paper, the first- and second-order Gaussian directional derivative representations of a step edge, four common genres of corners, an anisotropic-type blob, and an isotropic-type blob are analyzed and derived. Multiple interest point characteristics are discovered. The characteristics for interest points that we obtained help us describe the differences among edges, corners, and blobs, explain why the existing interest point detection methods with multiple scales cannot properly obtain interest points from images, and present novel corner and blob detection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods in terms of detection performance, robustness to affine transformations, noise, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.

AB This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a human performer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. Furthermore, we combine Neural Body with implicit surface models to improve the learned geometry. To evaluate our approach, we perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, which show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.

AB While recent machine learning research has revealed connections between deep generative models such as VAEs and rate-distortion losses used in learned compression, most of this work has focused on images. In a similar spirit, we view recently proposed neural video coding algorithms through the lens of deep autoregressive and latent variable modeling. We present these codecs as instances of a generalized stochastic temporal autoregressive transform, and propose new avenues for further improvements inspired by normalizing flows and structured priors. We propose several architectures that yield state-of-the-art video compression performance on high-resolution video and discuss their tradeoffs and ablations. In particular, we propose (i) improved temporal autoregressive transforms, (ii) improved entropy models with structured and temporal dependencies, and (iii) variable bitrate versions of our algorithms. Since our improvements are compatible with a large class of existing models, we provide further evidence that the generative modeling viewpoint can advance the neural video coding field.

AB Highly realistic imaging and video synthesis have become possible and relatively simple tasks with the rapid growth of generative adversarial networks (GANs). GAN-related applications, such as DeepFake image and video manipulation and adversarial attacks, have been used to disrupt and confound the truth in images and videos over social media. DeepFake technology aims to synthesize high visual quality image content that can mislead the human vision system, while the adversarial perturbation attempts to mislead the deep neural networks to a wrong prediction. Defense strategy becomes difficult when adversarial perturbation and DeepFake are combined. This study examined a novel deceptive mechanism based on statistical hypothesis testing against DeepFake manipulation and adversarial attacks. First, a deceptive model based on two isolated sub-networks was designed to generate two-dimensional random variables with a specific distribution for detecting the DeepFake image and video. This research proposes a maximum likelihood loss for training the deceptive model with two isolated sub-networks. Afterward, a novel hypothesis was proposed for a testing scheme to detect the DeepFake video and images with a well-trained deceptive model. The comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed decoy mechanism could be generalized to compressed and unseen manipulation methods for both DeepFake and attack detection.

AB Food recognition plays an important role in food choice and intake, which is essential to the health and well-being of humans. It is thus of importance to the computer vision community, and can further support many food-oriented vision and multimodal tasks, e.g., food detection and segmentation, cross-modal recipe retrieval and generation. Unfortunately, we have witnessed remarkable advancements in generic visual recognition for released large-scale datasets, yet largely lags in the food domain. In this paper, we introduce Food2K, which is the largest food recognition dataset with 2,000 categories and over 1 million images. Compared with existing food recognition datasets, Food2K bypasses them in both categories and images by one order of magnitude, and thus establishes a new challenging benchmark to develop advanced models for food visual representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a deep progressive region enhancement network for food recognition, which mainly consists of two components, namely progressive local feature learning and region feature enhancement. The former adopts improved progressive training to learn diverse and complementary local features, while the latter utilizes self-attention to incorporate richer context with multiple scales into local features for further local feature enhancement. Extensive experiments on Food2K demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. More importantly, we have verified better generalization ability of Food2K in various tasks, including food image recognition, food image retrieval, cross-modal recipe retrieval, food detection and segmentation. Food2K can be further explored to benefit more food-relevant tasks including emerging and more complex ones (e.g., nutritional understanding of food), and the trained models on Food2K can be expected as backbones to improve the performance of more food-relevant tasks. We also hope Food2K can serve as a large scale fine-grained visual recognition benchmark, and contributes to the development of large scale fine-grained visual analysis.

AB The widespread arising of data size gives rise to the necessity of undertaking large-scale data clustering tasks. To do so, the bipartite graph theory is frequently applied to design a scalable algorithm, which depicts the relations between samples and a few anchors, instead of binding pairwise samples. However, the bipartite graphs and existing spectral embedding methods ignore the explicit cluster structure learning. They have to obtain cluster labels by using post-processing like K-Means. More than that, existing anchor-based approaches always acquire anchors by using centroids of K-Means or a few random samples, both of which are time-saving but performance-unstable. In this paper, we investigate the scalability, stableness and integration in large-scale graph clustering. We propose a cluster-structured graph learning model, thus obtaining a c-connected (c is the cluster number) bipartite graph and also getting discrete labels straightforward. Taking data feature or pairwise relation as a start point, we further design an initialization-independent anchor selection strategy. Experimental results reported for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms its peers.

AB Learning with noisy labels has become imperative in the Big Data era, which saves expensive human labors on accurate annotations. Previous noise-transition-based methods have achieved theoretically-grounded performance under the Class-Conditional Noisemodel (CCN). However, these approaches builds upon an ideal but impractical anchor set available to pre-estimate the noise transition. Even though subsequent works adapt the estimation as a neural layer, the ill-posed stochastic learning of its parameters in back-propagation easily falls into undesired local minimums. We solve this problem by introducing a Latent Class-Conditional Noise model (LCCN) to parameterize the noise transition under a Bayesian framework. By projecting the noise transition into the Dirichlet space, the learning is constrained on a simplex characterized by the complete dataset, instead of some ad-hoc parametric space wrapped by the neural layer. We then deduce a dynamic label regression method for LCCN, whose Gibbs sampler allows us efficiently infer the latent true labels to train the classifier and to model the noise. Our approach safeguards the stable update of the noise transition, which avoids previous arbitrarily tuning from a mini-batch of samples. We further generalize LCCN to different counterparts compatible with open-set noisy labels, semi-supervised learning as well as cross-model training. A range of experiments demonstrate the advantages of LCCN and its variants over the current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at here.

AB Availability of labelled data is the major obstacle to the deployment of deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks in new domains. The fact that many frameworks adopted to solve different tasks share the same architecture suggests that there should be a way of reusing the knowledge learned in a specific setting to solve novel tasks with limited or no additional supervision. In this work, we first show that such knowledge can be shared across tasks by learning a mapping between task-specific deep features in a given domain. Then, we show that this mapping function, implemented by a neural network, is able to generalize to novel unseen domains. Besides, we propose a set of strategies to constrain the learned feature spaces, to ease learning and increase the generalization capability of the mapping network, thereby considerably improving the final performance of our framework. Our proposal obtains compelling results in challenging synthetic-to-real adaptation scenarios by transferring knowledge between monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation tasks.

AB Pairwise learning is receiving increasing attention since it covers many important machine learning tasks, e.g., metric learning, AUC maximization, and ranking. Investigating the generalization behavior of pairwise learning is thus of great significance. However, existing generalization analysis mainly focuses on the convex objective functions, leaving the nonconvex pairwise learning far less explored. Moreover, the current learning rates of pairwise learning are mostly of slower order. Motivated by these problems, we study the generalization performance of nonconvex pairwise learning and provide improved learning rates. Specifically, we develop different uniform convergence of gradients for pairwise learning under different assumptions, based on which we characterize empirical risk minimizer, gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent. We first establish learning rates for these algorithms in a general nonconvex setting, where the analysis sheds insights on the trade-off between optimization and generalization and the role of early-stopping. We then derive faster learning rates of order O(1/n) for nonconvex pairwise learning with a gradient dominance curvature condition, where n is the sample size. Provided that the optimal population risk is small, we further improve the learning rates to O(1/n(2)), which, to the best of our knowledge, are the first O(1/n(2)) rates for pairwise learning.

AB Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer inferior generalization performance to new datasets, largely due to the limited diversity of 2D-3D pose pairs in the training data. To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a novel auto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses towards greater diversity and thus enhances the generalization power of the trained 2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose augmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors of a pose through differentiable operations. With such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with the 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate more diverse and harder poses in an online manner. PoseAug is generic and handy to be applied to various 3D pose estimation models. It is also extendable to aid pose estimation from video frames. To demonstrate this, we introduce PoseAug-V, a simple yet effective method that decomposes video pose augmentation into end pose augmentation and conditioned intermediate pose generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseAug and its extension PoseAug-V bring clear improvements for frame-based and video-based 3D pose estimation on several out-of-domain 3D human pose benchmarks.

AB Super-Resolution from a single motion Blurred image (SRB) is a severely ill-posed problem due to the joint degradation of motion blurs and low spatial resolution. In this article, we employ events to alleviate the burden of SRB and propose an Event-enhanced SRB (E-SRB) algorithm, which can generate a sequence of sharp and clear images with High Resolution (HR) from a single blurry image with Low Resolution (LR). To achieve this end, we formulate an event-enhanced degeneration model to consider the low spatial resolution, motion blurs, and event noises simultaneously. We then build an event-enhanced Sparse Learning Network (eSL-Net++) upon a dual sparse learning scheme where both events and intensity frames are modeled with sparse representations. Furthermore, we propose an event shuffle-and-merge scheme to extend the single-frame SRB to the sequence-frame SRB without any additional training process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed eSL-Net++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Datasets, codes, and more results are available at https://github.com/ShinyWang33/eSL-Net-Plusplus.

AB Asymmetric kernels naturally exist in real life, e.g., for conditional probability and directed graphs. However, most of the existing kernel-based learning methods require kernels to be symmetric, which prevents the use of asymmetric kernels. This paper addresses the asymmetric kernel-based learning in the framework of the least squares support vector machine named AsK-LS, resulting in the first classification method that can utilize asymmetric kernels directly. We will show that AsK-LS can learn with asymmetric features, namely source and target features, while the kernel trick remains applicable, i.e., the source and target features exist but are not necessarily known. Besides, the computational burden of AsK-LS is as cheap as dealing with symmetric kernels. Experimental results on various tasks, including Corel, PASCAL VOC, Satellite, directed graphs, and UCI database, all show that in the case asymmetric information is crucial, the proposed AsK-LS can learn with asymmetric kernels and performs much better than the existing kernel methods that rely on symmetrization to accommodate asymmetric kernels.

AB We explore the task of language-guided video segmentation (LVS). Previous algorithms mostly adopt 3D CNNs to learn video representation, struggling to capture long-term context and easily suffering from visual-linguistic misalignment. In light of this, we present LOCATER (local-global context aware Transformer), which augments the Transformer architecture with a finite memory so as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient manner. The memory is designed to involve two components - one for persistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering local temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized local-global context and the particular content of each frame, LOCATER holistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query vector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for mask generation. The memory also allows LOCATER to process videos with linear time complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style self-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. To thoroughly examine the visual grounding capability of LVS models, we contribute a new LVS dataset, A2D-S+, which is built upon A2D-S dataset but poses increased challenges in disambiguating among similar objects. Experiments on three LVS datasets and our A2D-S+ show that LOCATER outperforms previous state-of-the-arts. Further, we won the 1st place in the Referring Video Object Segmentation Track of the 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge, where LOCATER served as the foundation for the winning solution.

AB Previous knowledge distillation (KD) methods for object detection mostly focus on feature imitation instead of mimicking the prediction logits due to its inefficiency in distilling the localization information. In this paper, we investigate whether logit mimicking always lags behind feature imitation. Towards this goal, we first present a novel localization distillation (LD) method which can efficiently transfer the localization knowledge from the teacher to the student. Second, we introduce the concept of valuable localization region that can aid to selectively distill the classification and localization knowledge for a certain region. Combining these two new components, for the first time, we show that logit mimicking can outperform feature imitation and the absence of localization distillation is a critical reason for why logit mimicking under-performs for years. The thorough studies exhibit the great potential of logit mimicking that can significantly alleviate the localization ambiguity, learn robust feature representation, and ease the training difficulty in the early stage. We also provide the theoretical connection between the proposed LD and the classification KD, that they share the equivalent optimization effect. Our distillation scheme is simple as well as effective and can be easily applied to both dense horizontal object detectors and rotated object detectors. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO, PASCAL VOC, and DOTA benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve considerable AP improvement without any sacrifice on the inference speed.

AB Despite the popularity of low-rank matrix completion, the majority of its theory has been developed under the assumption of random observation patterns, whereas very little is known about the practically relevant case of non-random patterns. Specifically, a fundamental yet largely open question is to describe patterns that allow for unique or finitely many completions. This paper provides three such families of patterns for any rank and any matrix size. A key to achieving this is a novel formulation of low-rank matrix completion in terms of Plucker coordinates, the latter a traditional tool in computer vision. This connection is of potential significance to a wide family of matrix and subspace learning problems with incomplete data.

AB While uniform sampling has been widely studied in the matrix completion literature, CUR sampling approximates a low-rank matrix via row and column samples. Unfortunately, both sampling models lack flexibility for various circumstances in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement sampling strategy, coined Cross-Concentrated Sampling (CCS). By bridging uniform sampling and CUR sampling, CCS provides extra flexibility that can potentially save sampling costs in applications. In addition, we also provide a sufficient condition for CCS-based matrix completion. Moreover, we propose a highly efficient non-convex algorithm, termed Iterative CUR Completion (ICURC), for the proposed CCS model. Numerical experiments verify the empirical advantages of CCS and ICURC against uniform sampling and its baseline algorithms, on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

AB Measuring perceptual color differences (CDs) is of great importance in modern smartphone photography. Despite the long history, most CD measures have been constrained by psychophysical data of homogeneous color patches or a limited number of simplistic natural photographic images. It is thus questionable whether existing CD measures generalize in the age of smartphone photography characterized by greater content complexities and learning-based image signal processors. In this article, we put together so far the largest image dataset for perceptual CD assessment, in which the photographic images are 1) captured by six flagship smartphones, 2) altered by Photoshop, 3) post-processed by built-in filters of the smartphones, and 4) reproduced with incorrect color profiles. We then conduct a large-scale psychophysical experiment to gather perceptual CDs of 30,000 image pairs in a carefully controlled laboratory environment. Based on the newly established dataset, we make one of the first attempts to construct an end-to-end learnable CD formula based on a lightweight neural network, as a generalization of several previous metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the optimized formula outperforms 33 existing CD measures by a large margin, offers reasonable local CD maps without the use of dense supervision, generalizes well to homogeneous color patch data, and empirically behaves as a proper metric in the mathematical sense. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/hellooks/CDNet.

AB Recently, many advances in inverse rendering are achieved by high-dimensional lighting representations and differentiable rendering. However, multi-bounce lighting effects can hardly be handled correctly in scene editing using high-dimensional lighting representations, and light source model deviation and ambiguities exist in differentiable rendering methods. These problems limit the applications of inverse rendering. In this paper, we present a multi-bounce inverse rendering method based on Monte Carlo path tracing, to enable correct complex multi-bounce lighting effects rendering in scene editing. We propose a novel light source model that is more suitable for light source editing in indoor scenes, and design a specific neural network with corresponding disambiguation constraints to alleviate ambiguities during the inverse rendering. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real indoor scenes through virtual object insertion, material editing, relighting tasks, and so on. The results demonstrate that our method achieves better photo-realistic quality.

AB The study of languages' structure and their organization in a set of well-defined relation schemes is a delicate matter. In the last decades, the convergence of traditional conflicting views by linguists is supported by an interdisciplinary approach that involves not only genetics or bio-archelogy but nowadays even the science of complexity. In light of this new and useful approach, this study proposes an in-depth analysis of the complexity underlying the morphological organization, in terms of multifractality and long-range correlations, of several modern and ancient texts pertaining to various linguistic strains (including ancient Greek, Arabic, Coptic, Neo-Latin and Germanic languages). The methodology is grounded on the mapping procedure between lexical categories belonging to text excerpts and time series, which is based on the rank of the frequency occurrence. Through the well-known MFDFA technique and a specific multifractal formalism, several multifractal indexes are then extracted for characterizing texts and the multifractal signature has been adopted for characterizing several language families, such as Indo-European, Semitic and Hamito-Semitic. The regularities and differences in the linguistic strains are assessed within a multivariate statistical framework and corroborated with a Machine Learning approach that is dedicated, in turn, to investigate the predictive power of the multifractal signature pertinent to text excerpts. The obtained results show a strong presence of persistence, i.e., memory, in the morphological structure of analyzed texts and we claim that this property has a role in characterizing the studied linguistic families. In fact, for example, the proposed analysis framework - grounded on complexity indexes - is able to easily distinguish ancient Greek texts from Arabic ones, as they belong to different language strains, i.e., indo-European and Semitic, respectively. The proposed approach has been proven effective and can be adopted for further comparative studies and for designing new informetrics for further advances in the fields of information retrieval and Artificial Intelligence.

AB Scene graph generation aims to interpret an input image by explicitly modelling the objects contained therein and their relationships. In existing methods the problem is predominantly solved by message passing neural network models. Unfortunately, in such models, the variational distributions generally ignore the structural dependencies among the output variables, and most of the scoring functions only consider pairwise dependencies. This can lead to inconsistent interpretations. In this article, we propose a novel neural belief propagation method seeking to replace the traditional mean field approximation with a structural Bethe approximation. To find a better bias-variance trade-off, higher-order dependencies among three or more output variables are also incorporated into the relevant scoring function. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Segmenting highly-overlapping image objects is challenging, because there is typically no distinction between real object contours and occlusion boundaries on images. Unlike previous instance segmentation methods, we model image formation as a composition of two overlapping layers, and propose Bilayer Convolutional Network (BCNet</italic>), where the top layer detects occluding objects (occluders) and the bottom layer infers partially occluded instances (occludees). The explicit modeling of occlusion relationship with bilayer structure naturally decouples the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded instances, and considers the interaction between them during mask regression. We investigate the efficacy of bilayer structure using two popular convolutional network designs, namely, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Further, we formulate bilayer decoupling using the vision transformer (ViT), by representing instances in the image as separate learnable occluder and occludee queries. Large and consistent improvements using one/two-stage and query-based object detectors with various backbones and network layer choices validate the generalization ability of bilayer decoupling, as shown by extensive experiments on image instance segmentation benchmarks (COCO, KINS, COCOA) and video instance segmentation benchmarks (YTVIS, OVIS, BDD100 K MOTS), especially for heavy occlusion cases.

TI Online Knowledge Distillation via Mutual Contrastive Learning for Visual

AB The teacher-free online Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train an ensemble of multiple student models collaboratively and distill knowledge from each other. Although existing online KD methods achieve desirable performance, they often focus on class probabilities as the core knowledge type, ignoring the valuable feature representational information. We present a Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework for online KD. The core idea ofMCLis to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of networks in an online manner. Our MCL can aggregate cross-network embedding information and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two networks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to better feature representations, thus improving the performance of visual recognition tasks. Beyond the final layer, we extend MCL to intermediate layers and perform an adaptive layer-matching mechanism trained by meta-optimization. Experiments on image classification and transfer learning to visual recognition tasks show that layer-wise MCL can lead to consistent performance gains against state-of-the-art online KD approaches. The superiority demonstrates that layer-wise MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations. Our code is publicly avaliable at https://github.com/winycg/L-MCL.

ID ROC CURVE; AREA; OPTIMIZATION; RANKING; BOUNDS
AB The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a crucial metric for machine learning, which evaluates the average performance over all possible True Positive Rates (TPRs) and False Positive Rates (FPRs). Based on the knowledge that a skillful classifier should simultaneously embrace a high TPR and a low FPR, we turn to study a more general variant called Two-way Partial AUC (TPAUC), where only the region with TPR >= alpha, FPR <= beta is included in the area. Moreover, a recent work shows that the TPAUC is essentially inconsistent with the existing Partial AUC metrics where only the FPR range is restricted, opening a new problem to seek solutions to leverage high TPAUC. Motivated by this, we present the first trial in this article to optimize this new metric. The critical challenge along this course lies in the difficulty of performing gradient-based optimization with end-to-end stochastic training, evenwith a proper choice of surrogate loss. To address this issue, we propose a generic framework to construct surrogate optimization problems, which supports efficient end-to-end training with deep learning. Moreover, our theoretical analyses show that: 1) the objective function of the surrogate problems will achieve an upper bound of the original problem under mild conditions, and 2) optimizing the surrogate problems leads to good generalization performance in terms of TPAUC with a high probability. Finally, empirical studies over several benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of our framework.

AB Establishing robust and accurate correspondences between a pair of images is a long-standing computer vision problem with numerous applications. While classically dominated by sparse methods, emerging dense approaches offer a compelling alternative paradigm that avoids the keypoint detection step. However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements, occlusions, or homogeneous regions. In order to apply dense methods to real-world applications, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is therefore crucial to estimate the confidence of the predicted matches. We propose the Enhanced Probabilistic Dense Correspondence Network, PDC-Net+, capable of estimating accurate dense correspondences along with a reliable confidence map. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop an architecture and an enhanced training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging geometric matching and optical flow datasets. We further validate the usefulness of our probabilistic confidence estimation for the tasks of pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, image-based localization, and image retrieval.

TI Performance-Aware Approximation of Global Channel Pruning for Multitask

DE Channel pruning; multitask learning; performance-aware oracle criterion;
   sequentially greedy algorithm
ID DEEP; MODELS
AB Global channel pruning (GCP) aims to remove a subset of channels (filters) across different layers from a deep model without hurting the performance. Previous works focus on either single task model pruning or simply adapting it to multitask scenario, and still face the following problems when handling multitask pruning: 1) Due to the task mismatch, a well-pruned backbone for classification task focuses on preserving filters that can extract category-sensitive information, causing filters that may be useful for other tasks to be pruned during the backbone pruning stage; 2) For multitask predictions, different filters within or between layers are more closely related and interacted than that for single task prediction, making multitask pruning more difficult. Therefore, aiming at multitask model compression, we propose a Performance-Aware Global Channel Pruning (PAGCP) framework. We first theoretically present the objective for achieving superior GCP, by considering the joint saliency of filters from intra- and inter-layers. Then a sequentially greedy pruning strategy is proposed to optimize the objective, where a performance-aware oracle criterion is developed to evaluate sensitivity of filters to each task and preserve the globally most task-related filters. Experiments on several multitask datasets show that the proposed PAGCP can reduce the FLOPs and parameters by over 60% with minor performance drop, and achieves 1.2x similar to 3.3x acceleration on both cloud and mobile platforms. Our code is available at http://www.github.com/HankYe/PAGCP.git.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB In recommender systems, users' behavior data are driven by the interactions of user-item latent factors. To improve recommendation effectiveness and robustness, recent advances focus on latent factor disentanglement via variational inference. Despite significant progress, uncovering the underlying interactions, i.e., dependencies of latent factors, remains largely neglected by the literature. To bridge the gap, we investigate the joint disentanglement of user-item latent factors and the dependencies between them, namely latent structure learning. We propose to analyze the problem from the causal perspective, where a latent structure should ideally reproduce observational interaction data, and satisfy the structure acyclicity and dependency constraints, i.e., causal prerequisites. We further identify the recommendation-specific challenges for latent structure learning, i.e., the subjective nature of users' minds and the inaccessibility of private/sensitive user factors causing universally learned latent structure to be suboptimal for individuals. To address these challenges, we propose the personalized latent structure learning framework for recommendation, namely PlanRec, which incorporates 1) differentiable Reconstruction, Dependency, and Acyclicity regularizations to satisfy the causal prerequisites; 2) Personalized Structure Learning (PSL) which personalizes the universally learned dependencies through probabilistic modeling; and 3) uncertainty estimation which explicitly measures the uncertainty of structure personalization, and adaptively balances personalization and shared knowledge for different users. We conduct extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets from MovieLens and Amazon, and a large-scale industrial dataset from Alipay. Empirical studies validate that PlanRec discovers effective shared/personalized structures, and successfully balances shared knowledge and personalization via rational uncertainty estimation.

ID IMAGE TRANSLATION
AB Image-to-image translation (i2i) networks suffer from entanglement effects in presence of physics-related phenomena in target domain (such as occlusions, fog, etc), lowering altogether the translation quality, controllability and variability. In this paper, we propose a general framework to disentangle visual traits in target images. Primarily, we build upon collection of simple physics models, guiding the disentanglement with a physical model that renders some of the target traits, and learning the remaining ones. Because physics allows explicit and interpretable outputs, our physical models (optimally regressed on target) allows generating unseen scenarios in a controllable manner. Secondarily, we show the versatility of our framework to neural-guided disentanglement where a generative network is used in place of a physical model in case the latter is not directly accessible. Altogether, we introduce three strategies of disentanglement being guided from either a fully differentiable physics model, a (partially) non-differentiable physics model, or a neural network. The results show our disentanglement strategies dramatically increase performances qualitatively and quantitatively in several challenging scenarios for image translation.

TI Progressive Instance-Aware Feature Learning for Compositional Action

DE Compositional action recognition; compositional generalization; human
   action recognition
AB In order to enable the model to generalize to unseen action-objects (compositional action), previous methods encode multiple pieces of information (i.e., the appearance, position, and identity of visual instances) independently and concatenate them for classification. However, these methods ignore the potential supervisory role of instance information (i.e., position and identity) in the process of visual perception. To this end, we present a novel framework, namely Progressive Instance-aware Feature Learning (PIFL), to progressively extract, reason, and predict dynamic cues of moving instances from videos for compositional action recognition. Specifically, this framework extracts features from foreground instances that are likely to be relevant to human actions (Position-aware Appearance Feature Extraction in Section III-B1), performs identity-aware reasoning among instance-centric features with semantic-specific interactions (Identity-aware Feature Interaction in Section III-B2), and finally predicts instances position from observed states to force the model into perceiving their movement (Semantic-aware Position Prediction in Section III-B3). We evaluate our approach on two compositional action recognition benchmarks, namely, Something-Else and IKEA-Assembly. Our approach achieves consistent accuracy gain beyond off-the-shelf action recognition algorithms in terms of both ground truth and detected position of instances.

TI Random Cycle Loss and Its Application to Voice Conversion

DE Cycle consistency; information disentanglement; information bottleneck;

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPEAKER; REPRESENTATION
AB Speech disentanglement aims to decompose independent causal factors of speech signals into separate codes. Perfect disentanglement benefits to a broad range of speech processing tasks. This paper presents a simple but effective disentanglement approach based on cycle consistency loss and random factor substitution. This leads to a novel random cycle (RC) loss that enforces analysis-and-resynthesis consistency, a main principle of reductionism. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed RC loss can achieve independent codes if well optimized, which in turn leads to superior disentanglement when combined with information bottleneck (IB). Extensive simulation experiments were conducted to understand the properties of the RC loss, and experimental results on voice conversion further demonstrate the practical merit of the proposal.

AB Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been of significant interest for various computer vision applications. Recent successful methods rely on the current progress in deep neural network architectural designs (e.g., with vision transformers). Motivated by the recent progress achieved with state-of-the-art conditional generative models, we present a novel patch-based image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our patch-based diffusion modeling approach enables size-agnostic image restoration by using a guided denoising process with smoothed noise estimates across overlapping patches during inference. We empirically evaluate our model on benchmark datasets for image desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. We demonstrate our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performances on both weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration, and experimentally show strong generalization to real-world test images.

TI Robust Face Alignment via Inherent Relation Learning and Uncertainty
   Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Coarse-to-fine regression; face alignment; inherent relation learning;
   uncertainty estimation
AB Human tends to locate the facial landmarks with heavy occlusion by their relative position to the easily identified landmarks. The clue is defined as the landmark inherent relation while it is ignored by most existing methods. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Local Patch Transformer (DSLPT), a novel face alignment framework for the inherent relation learning and uncertainty estimation. Unlike most existing methods that regress facial landmarks directly from global features, the DSLPT first generates a rough representation of each landmark from a local patch cropped from the feature map and then adaptively aggregates them by a case dependent inherent relation. Finally, the DSLPT predicts the coordinate and uncertainty of each landmark by regressing their probability distribution from the output features. Moreover, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework to incorporate with DSLPT for an improved result. In the framework, the position and size of each patch are determined by the probability distribution of the corresponding landmark predicted in the previous stage. The dynamic patches will ensure a fine-grained landmark representation for inherent relation learning so that a rough prediction result can gradually converge to the target facial landmarks. We integrate the coarse-to-fine model into an end-to-end training pipeline and carry out experiments on the mainstream benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the DSLPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with much less computational complexity. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/DSLPT.

AB We present RoReg, a novel point cloud registration framework that fully exploits oriented descriptors and estimated local rotations in the whole registration pipeline. Previous methods mainly focus on extracting rotation-invariant descriptors for registration but unanimously neglect the orientations of descriptors. In this paper, we show that the oriented descriptors and the estimated local rotations are very useful in the whole registration pipeline, including feature description, feature detection, feature matching, and transformation estimation. Consequently, we design a novel oriented descriptor RoReg-Desc and apply RoReg-Desc to estimate the local rotations. Such estimated local rotations enable us to develop a rotation-guided detector, a rotation coherence matcher, and a one-shot-estimation RANSAC, all of which greatly improve the registration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoReg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely-used 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch datasets, and also generalizes well to the outdoor ETH dataset. In particular, we also provide in-depth analysis on each component of RoReg, validating the improvements brought by oriented descriptors and the estimated local rotations.

DE Weakly supervised object detection; weakly supervised semantic
   segmentation; weakly supervised instance segmentation
AB Weakly supervised vision tasks, including detection and segmentation, have attracted much attention in the vision community recently. However, the lack of detailed and precise annotations in the weakly supervised case leads to a large accuracy gap between weakly- and fully-supervised methods. In this article, we propose a new framework, Salvage of Supervision (SoS), with the key idea being to effectively harness every potentially useful supervisory signal in weakly supervised vision tasks. Starting with weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), we propose SoS-WSOD to shrink the technology gap between WSOD and FSOD, which utilizes the weak image-level labels, the pseudo-labels, and the power of semi-supervised object detection for WSOD. Moreover, SoS-WSOD removes restrictions in traditional WSOD methods, including the reliance on ImageNet pretraining and inability to use modern backbones. The SoS framework also extends to weakly supervised semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. On several weakly supervised vision benchmarks, SoS achieves significant performance boost and generalization ability.

AB Modern medical imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, have enabled the evaluation of myocardial deformation directly from an image sequence. While many traditional cardiac motion tracking methods have been developed for the automated estimation of the myocardial wall deformation, they are not widely used in clinical diagnosis, due to their lack of accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based fully unsupervised method, SequenceMorph, for in vivo motion tracking in cardiac image sequences. In our method, we introduce the concept of motion decomposition and recomposition. We first estimate the inter-frame (INF) motion field between any two consecutive frames, by a bi-directional generative diffeomorphic registration neural network. Using this result, we then estimate the Lagrangian motion field between the reference frame and any other frame, through a differentiable composition layer. Our framework can be extended to incorporate another registration network, to further reduce the accumulated errors introduced in the INF motion tracking step, and to refine the Lagrangian motion estimation. By utilizing temporal information to perform reasonable estimations of spatio-temporal motion fields, this novel method provides a useful solution for image sequence motion tracking. Our method has been applied to US (echocardiographic) and cardiac MR (untagged and tagged cine) image sequences; the results show that SequenceMorph is significantly superior to conventional motion tracking methods, in terms of the cardiac motion tracking accuracy and inference efficiency.

AB Insufficient annotated data and minor lung lesions pose big challenges for computed tomography (CT)-aided automatic COVID-19 diagnosis at an early outbreak stage. To address this issue, we propose a Semi-Supervised Tri-Branch Network (SS-TBN). First, we develop a joint TBN model for dual-task application scenarios of image segmentation and classification such as CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, in which pixel-level lesion segmentation and slice-level infection classification branches are simultaneously trained via lesion attention, and individual-level diagnosis branch aggregates slice-level outputs for COVID-19 screening. Second, we propose a novel hybrid semi-supervised learning method to make full use of unlabeled data, combining a new double-threshold pseudo labeling method specifically designed to the joint model and a new inter-slice consistency regularization method specifically tailored to CT images. Besides two publicly available external datasets, we collect internal and our own external datasets including 210,395 images (1,420 cases versus 498 controls) from ten hospitals. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in COVID-19 classification with limited annotated data even if lesions are subtle, and that segmentation results promote interpretability for diagnosis, suggesting the potential of the SS-TBN in early screening in insufficient labeled data situations at the early stage of a pandemic outbreak like COVID-19.

AB Temporal sentence grounding in videos (TSGV), a.k.a., natural language video localization (NLVL) or video moment retrieval (VMR), aims to retrieve a temporal moment that semantically corresponds to a language query from an untrimmed video. Connecting computer vision and natural language, TSGV has drawn significant attention from researchers in both communities. This survey attempts to provide a summary of fundamental concepts in TSGV and current research status, as well as future research directions. As the background, we present a common structure of functional components in TSGV, in a tutorial style: from feature extraction from raw video and language query, to answer prediction of the target moment. Then we review the techniques for multimodal understanding and interaction, which is the key focus of TSGV for effective alignment between the two modalities. We construct a taxonomy of TSGV techniques and elaborate the methods in different categories with their strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, we discuss issues with the current TSGV research and share our insights about promising research directions.

AB Brain signals are nonlinear and nonstationary time series, which provide information about spatiotemporal patterns of electrical activity in the brain. CHMMs are suitable tools for modeling multi-channel time-series dependent on both time and space, but state-space parameters grow exponentially with the number of channels. To cope with this limitation, we consider the influence model as the interaction of hidden Markov chains called Latent Structure Influence Models (LSIMs). LSIMs are capable of detecting nonlinearity and nonstationarity, making them well suited for multi-channel brain signals. We apply LSIMs to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics in multi-channel EEG/ECoG signals. The current manuscript extends the scope of the re-estimation algorithm from HMMs to LSIMs. We prove that the re-estimation algorithm of LSIMs will converge to stationary points corresponding to Kullback-Leibler divergence. We prove convergence by developing a new auxiliary function using the influence model and a mixture of strictly log-concave or elliptically symmetric densities. The theories that support this proof are derived from previous studies by Baum, Liporace, Dempster, and Juang. We then develop a closed-form expression for re-estimation formulas using tractable marginal forward-backward parameters defined in our previous study. Simulated datasets and EEG/ECoG recordings confirm the practical convergence of the derived re-estimation formulas. We also study the use of LSIMs for modeling and classification on simulated and real EEG/ECoG datasets. Based on AIC and BIC, LSIMs perform better than HMMs and CHMMs in modeling embedded Lorenz systems and ECoG recordings. LSIMs are more reliable and better classifiers than HMMs, SVMs and CHMMs in 2-class simulated CHMMs. EEG biometric verification results indicate that the LSIM-based method improves the area under curve (AUC) values by about 6.8 and decreases the standard deviation of AUC values from 5.4 to 3.3 compared to the existing HMM-based method for all conditions on the BED dataset.

TI Training Compact CNNs for Image Classification Using Dynamic-Coded
   Filter Fusion
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Image classification; filter pruning; filter fusion; compact CNNs
AB The mainstream approach for filter pruning is usually either to force a hard-coded importance estimation upon a computation-heavy pretrained model to select "important" filters, or to impose a hyperparameter-sensitive sparse constraint on the loss objective to regularize the network training. In this paper, we present a novel filter pruning method, dubbed dynamic-coded filter fusion (DCFF), to derive compact CNNs in a computation-economical and regularization-free manner for efficient image classification. Each filter in our DCFF is first given an inter-similarity distribution with a temperature parameter as a filter proxy, on top of which, a fresh Kullback-Leibler divergence based dynamic-coded criterion is proposed to evaluate the filter importance. In contrast to simply keeping high-score filters in other methods, we propose the concept of filter fusion, i.e., the weighted averages using the assigned proxies, as our preserved filters. We obtain a one-hot inter-similarity distribution as the temperature parameter approaches infinity. Thus, the relative importance of each filter can vary alongwith the training of the compactCNN, leading to dynamically changeable fused filters without both the dependency on the pretrained model and the introduction of sparse constraints. Extensive experiments on classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DCFF over the compared counterparts. For example, our DCFF derives a compact VGGNet-16 with only 72.77M FLOPs and 1.06M parameters while reaching top-1 accuracy of 93.47% on CIFAR-10. A compact ResNet-50 is obtained with 63.8% FLOPs and 58.6% parameter reductions, retaining 75.60% top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC-2012. Our code, narrower models and training logs are available at https://github.com/lmbxmu/DCFF.

AB The goal of 3D pose transfer is to transfer the pose from the source mesh to the target mesh while preserving the identity information (e.g., face, body shape) of the targetmesh. Deep learning-based methods improved the efficiency and performance of 3D pose transfer. However, most of them are trained under the supervision of the ground truth, whose availability is limited in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present X-DualNet, a simple yet effective approach that enables unsupervised 3D pose transfer. In X-DualNet, we introduce a generatorGwhich contains correspondence learning and pose transfer modules to achieve 3D pose transfer. We learn the shape correspondence by solving an optimal transport problem without any key point annotations and generate high-quality meshes with our elastic instance normalization (ElaIN) in the pose transfer module. With G as the basic component, we propose a cross consistency learning scheme and a dual reconstruction objective to learn the pose transfer without supervision. Besides that, we also adopt an as-rigid-as-possible deformer in the training process to fine-tune the body shape of the generated results. Extensive experiments on human and animal data demonstrate that our framework can successfully achieve comparable performance as the state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

AB Graph matching (GM) has been a long-standing combinatorial problem due to its NP-hard nature. Recently (deep) learning-based approaches have shown their superiority over the traditional solvers while the methods are almost based on supervised learning which can be expensive or even impractical. We develop a unified unsupervised framework from matching two graphs to multiple graphs, without correspondence ground truth for training. Specifically, a Siamese-style unsupervised learning framework is devised and trained by minimizing the discrepancy of a second-order classic solver and a first-order (differentiable) Sinkhorn net as two branches for matching prediction. The two branches share the same CNN backbone for visual graph matching. Our framework further allows unsupervised learning with graphs from a mixture of modes which is ubiquitous in reality. Specifically, we develop and unify the graduated assignment (GA) strategy for matching two-graph, multi-graph, and graphs from a mixture of modes, whereby two-way constraint and clustering confidence (for mixture case) are modulated by two separate annealing parameters, respectively. Moreover, for partial and outlier matching, an adaptive reweighting technique is developed to suppress the overmatching issue. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks including natural image matching show our unsupervised method performs comparatively and even better against two-graph based supervised approaches.

AB Nested dropout is a variant of dropout operation that is able to order network parameters or features based on the pre-defined importance during training. It has been explored for: I. Constructing nested nets Cui et al. 2020, Cui et al. 2021: the nested nets are neural networks whose architectures can be adjusted instantly during testing time, e.g., based on computational constraints. The nested dropout implicitly ranks the network parameters, generating a set of sub-networks such that any smaller sub-network forms the basis of a larger one. II. Learning ordered representation Rippel et al. 2014: the nested dropout applied to the latent representation of a generative model (e.g., auto-encoder) ranks the features, enforcing explicit order of the dense representation over dimensions. However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyper-parameter during the whole training process. For nested nets, when network parameters are removed, the performance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory learned from data. For generative models, the importance of features is specified as a constant vector, restraining the flexibility of representation learning. To address the problem, we focus on the probabilistic counterpart of the nested dropout. We propose a variational nested dropout (VND) operation that draws samples of multi-dimensional ordered masks at a low cost, providing useful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach, we design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of the parameter distributions. We further exploit the VND under different generative models for learning ordered latent distributions. In experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms the nested network in terms of accuracy, calibration, and out-of-domain detection in classification tasks. It also outperforms the related generative models on data generation tasks.

AB Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has attracted a lot of interest in recent years due to its application in many tasks, such as object detection, object tracking, scene segmentation, and crowd counting. In addition to conventional VIF methods, an increasing number of deep learning-based VIF methods have been proposed in the last five years. Different types of methods, such as CNN-based, autoencoder-based, GAN-based, and transformer-based methods, have been proposed. Deep learning-based methods have undoubtedly become dominant methods for the VIF task. However, while much progress has been made, the field will benefit from a systematic review of these deep learning-based methods. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VIF methods. We discuss motivation, taxonomy, recent development characteristics, datasets, and performance evaluation methods in detail. We also discuss future prospects of the VIF field. This paper can serve as a reference for VIF researchers and those interested in entering this fast-developing field.

   object detection
AB Object detection (OD) is a crucial computer vision task that has seen the development of many algorithms and models over the years. While the performance of current OD models has improved, they have also become more complex, making them impractical for industry applications due to their large parameter size. To tackle this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) technology was proposed in 2015 for image classification and subsequently extended to other visual tasks due to its ability to transfer knowledge learned by complex teacher models to lightweight student models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD-based OD models developed in recent years, with the aim of providing researchers with an overview of recent progress in the field. We conduct an in-depth analysis of existing works, highlighting their advantages and limitations, and explore future research directions to inspire the design of models for related tasks. We summarize the basic principles of designing KD-based OD models, describe related KD-based OD tasks, including performance improvements for lightweight models, catastrophic forgetting in incremental OD, small object detection, and weakly/semi-supervised OD. We also analyze novel distillation techniques, i.e. different types of distillation loss, feature interaction between teacher and student models, etc. Additionally, we provide an overview of the extended applications of KD-based OD models on specific datasets, such as remote sensing images and 3D point cloud datasets. We compare and analyze the performance of different models on several common datasets and discuss promising directions for solving specific OD problems.

TI Augmentation Pathways Network for Visual Recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Augmentation pathways network; data augmentation; neural network design;
   visual recognition
AB Data augmentation is practically helpful for visual recognition, especially at the time of data scarcity. However, such success is only limited to quite a few light augmentations (e.g., random crop, flip). Heavy augmentations are either unstable or show adverse effects during training, owing to the big gap between the original and augmented images. This paper introduces a novel network design, noted as Augmentation Pathways (AP), to systematically stabilize training on a much wider range of augmentation policies. Notably, AP tames various heavy data augmentations and stably boosts performance without a careful selection among augmentation policies. Unlike traditional single pathway, augmented images are processed in different neural paths. The main pathway handles the light augmentations, while other pathways focus on the heavier augmentations. By interacting with multiple paths in a dependent manner, the backbone network robustly learns from shared visual patterns among augmentations, and suppresses the side effect of heavy augmentations at the same time. Furthermore, we extend AP to high-order versions for high-order scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility in practical usage. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate the compatibility and effectiveness on a much wider range of augmentations, while consuming fewer parameters and lower computational costs at inference time.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Persistent Homology (PH) has been successfully used to train networks to detect curvilinear structures and to improve the topological quality of their results. However, existing methods are very global and ignore the location of topological features. In this paper, we remedy this by introducing a new filtration function that fuses two earlier approaches: thresholding-based filtration, previously used to train deep networks to segment medical images, and filtration with height functions, typically used to compare 2D and 3D shapes. We experimentally demonstrate that deep networks trained using our PH-based loss function yield reconstructions of road networks and neuronal processes that reflect ground-truth connectivity better than networks trained with existing loss functions based on PH.

ID RANDOMIZED SKETCHES
AB Kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) is a popular tool as a nonlinear extension of Fisher's linear discriminant, based on the use of the kernel trick. However, its asymptotic properties are still rarely studied. We first present an operator-theoretical formulation of KFD which elucidates the population target of the estimation problem. Convergence of the KFD solution to its population target is then established. However, the complexity of finding the solution poses significant challenges when n is large and we further propose a sketched estimation approach based on a m x n sketching matrix which possesses the same asymptotic properties (in terms of convergence rate) even whenmis much smaller thann. Some numerical results are presented to illustrate the performances of the sketched estimator.

AB In today's world, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) through video streams is actively used in every aspect of our life, such as automated surveillance systems and sports statistics are computed according to the videos with the help of HAR. Activity detection is not a new subject, and several methods are available. However, the most recent and most promising techniques rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs primary usage is based on a single image frame to perform logical or categorical identification of an object, scene, or activity. We exploit this feature to adapt CNN on video streams to achieve HAR. In this study, we present a Personalized HAR (PHAR) framework that increases activity recognition accuracy with Object Detection (OD). First, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art HAR and OD methods in the literature. Then we illustrate our framework with two new Single Person Human Activity Recognition models. Finally, the performance of the new framework is evaluated with the well-known activity detection methods. Results show that our new PHAR model with 95% accuracy ratio outperforms the CNN-LSTM-based reference model (90%). Moreover, a new metric Average Accuracy Score (AAS) is described in this study, PHAR models approximately have 94% AAS, which is better than the reference model with 89% AAS.

AB The past decade has witnessed significant progress in detecting objects by using enormous features of deep learning models. But, most of the existing models are unable to detect x-small and dense objects, due to the futility of feature extraction, and substantial misalignments between anchor boxes and axis-aligned convolution features, which leads to the discrepancy between the categorization score and positioning accuracy. This paper introduces an anchor regenerative-based transformer module in a feature refinement network to solve this problem. The anchor-regenerative module can generate anchor scales based on the semantic statistics of the objects present in the image, which avoids the inconsistency between the anchor boxes and axis-aligned convolution features. Whereas, the Multi-Head-Self-Attention (MHSA) based transformer module extracts the in-depth information from the feature maps based on the query, key, and value parameter information. This proposed model is experimentally verified on the VisDrone, VOC, and SKU-110K datasets. This model generates different anchor scales for these three datasets and achieves higher mAP, precision, and recall values on three datasets. These tested results prove that the suggested model has outstanding achievements compared with existing models in detecting x-small objects as well as dense objects. Finally, we evaluated the performance of these three datasets by using accuracy, kappa coefficient, and ROC metrics. These evaluated metrics demonstrate that our model is a good fit for VOC, and SKU-110K datasets. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adversarial examples; Transferability; Gradient -based attack; Adaptive
   inertia; Amplitude spectrum dropout
AB Deep neural networks are sensitive to adversarial examples and would produce wrong results with high confidence. However, most existing attack methods exhibit weak transferability, especially for adversarially trained models and defense models. In this paper, two methods are proposed to generate highly transferable adversarial examples, namely Adaptive Inertia Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (AdaI2-FGSM) and Amplitude Spectrum Dropout Method (ASDM). Specifically, AdaI2FGSM aims to integrate adaptive inertia into the gradient-based attack, and leverage the looking ahead property to search for a flatter maximum, which is essential to strengthen the transferability of adversarial examples. By introducing a loss-preserving transformation in the frequency domain, the proposed ASDM with the dropout invariance property can craft the copies of input images to overcome the poor generalization on the surrogate models. Furthermore, AdaI2-FGSM and ASDM can be naturally integrated as an efficient gradient-based attack method to yield more transferable adversarial examples. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset demonstrate that higher transferability is achieved by our method than some advanced gradient-based attacks. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID RESCUE
AB Previous studies have not extensively researched swarm robot multiobjective search in a complex environment sunch as unknown dynamic nonconvex (UDNC) obstacle environment to address collision prediction and low search efficiency. In addition, research on unnecessary excessive robot rotation and the loss caused by rotation during movement has not received enough attention. In this paper, a multitarget search strategy of a robot swarm based on triangular cones (MSTC) is proposed to satisfy the previously mentioned challenges. First, to address the problem of obstacle avoidance in a UDNC environment, an expanding triangular cone (ETC) method is proposed. This method not only considers the size of the robot but also enables the robot to avoid obstacles and other robots effectively and safely. Second, a roaming direction cone (RDC) and a target search cone (TSC) are proposed to improve the robot's search ability. The RDC improves the ability to exploit the global unknown environment, while the TSC effectively enhances the local search capabilities. Furthermore, the three methods can avoid the time consumption, energy consumption and mechanical loss due to unnecessary direction rotation through a simple geometric relationship to improve the robot service life. Finally, the three proposed methods are combined to construct an MSTC strategy to simulate the multitarget search process of swarm robots. Simulation experiments are carried out using a simplified virtual force (SVF), a straight-line search method different from the nearest neighbour (LSDN), and a particle swarm optimization algorithm with kinematic constraints (KCPSO). The results show that the time consumption, the road consumption, the degree of rotation and the number of rotations have all made significant improvements.

AB Core vector machine (CVM) is considered as a popular machine learning technique, mostly used for classification and regression. Its generalized form can be either applied to kernel methods or used with linear and nonlinear kernels. As a classifier, both the kernel function and its parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of CVM classification. In this paper, a metaheuristic kernel core vector machine (MKCVM) was applied by using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization. It was done through an innovative parameter selection technique in order to obtain a proper kernel function based on a nonlinear combination of standard kernel functions. The CVM true classification rate and geometric mean accuracy were adopted as the fitness criteria of the proposed approach, to be maximized. In addition, some benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the proposed approach. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method could decrease CVM classification error and increase its geometric mean accuracy. This has a comparative performance rather than support vector machine with lower memory and computational complexity. Moreover, MKCVM showed the acceptable capability to deal with imbalanced data. So, it had a good ability for handling binary and multiclass data classification.

AB A hybrid model with multiple sub-classifier is a powerful classifier for intelligent fault diagnosis of gearboxes. Each sub-classifier is used to deal with different gear or bearing faults, and thus each should have its own optimal feature group. However, these sub-classifiers in the hybrid model used the same feature group in most reported feature selection methods. To overcome this problem, this study brings some insights into optimization on subclassifiers. This proposed method, known as block feature selection (BFS), optimizes the feature group for only one fault type in each sub-classifier. The selected groups are then amalgamated to form the optimal features for all types of gearbox failures, with corresponding labels in the hybrid model. Each sub-classifier is considered to be one block. In each block, the concept of NSGA-II is used to select features for its corresponding sub-classifier. Then, a new sorting algorithm is proposed to find the best feature group of sub-classifier. In general, BFS can optimize features of each sub-classifier to find the best feature group for hybrid model. The effectiveness of BFS is validated by experimental data from bearing and gear faults in a planetary gearbox rig. The robustness of BFS is verified by incorporating white noise at different levels.

ID PROGNOSTICS
AB Prognostics and health management (PHM) of turbine cutting tools, particularly the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a Gordian technique to maintain the reliability and availability of the turbine, which is also a method to reduce unexpected downtime and total machined costs. Nowadays, most of the recent works in RUL prediction neglect the quality of data used for model training, assuming that the collected sensor data and extracted features can both reflect the degradation process well, which is not always true. This paper firstly introduces a novel cumulative descriptor to better represent the degradation process of cutting tools and further proposes a well-designed stacking-based deep neural network (S-DNN) that contains several different neuron architectures and an ensemble model to construct deep learning layer and ensemble learning layer. Cumulative descriptors are constructed only using directly measured values extracted from raw sensor data, and then the constructed novel features will be fed into S-DNN to extract abstract features from sensor data in multiple ways and automatically learn the relationship between the outputs of deep learning layer and the ground truth by training the ensemble model iteratively. Case studies on experimental data set and NASA Ames milling data set indicate that the proposed method has great effectiveness and generalization in RUL prediction tasks.

DE Fault detection; Freight train images; Knowledge distillation;
   Real-time; Light-weight
AB Efficient visual fault detection of freight trains is a critical part of ensuring the safe operation of railways under the restricted hardware environment. Although deep learning-based approaches have excelled in object detection, the efficiency of freight train fault detection is still insufficient to apply in real-world engineering. This paper proposes a heterogeneous self-distillation framework to ensure detection accuracy and speed while satisfying low resource requirements. The privileged information in the output feature knowledge can be transferred from the teacher to the student model through distillation to boost performance. We first adopt a lightweight backbone to extract features and generate a new heterogeneous knowledge neck. Such neck models positional information and long-range dependencies among channels through parallel encoding to optimize feature extraction capabilities. Then, we utilize the general distribution to obtain more credible and accurate bounding box estimates. Finally, we employ a novel loss function that makes the network easily concentrate on values near the label to improve learning efficiency. Experiments on four fault datasets reveal that our framework can achieve over 37 frames per second and maintain the highest accuracy of 98.88% in comparison with traditional distillation approaches. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our framework demonstrates more competitive performance with lower memory usage and the smallest model size.

TI Mitigate forgetting in few-shot class-incremental learning using

DE Incremental learning; Few -shot learning; Catastrophic forgetting; Image
   classification
AB In the few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) setting, new classes with few training examples become available incrementally, and deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of the previous classes when trained on new classes. Data augmentation techniques are generally used to increase the training data and improve the model performance. In this work, we demonstrate that differently augmented views of the same image obtained by applying data augmentations may not necessarily activate the same set of neurons in the model. Therefore, the information gained by a model regarding a class, when trained using data augmentation, may not necessarily be stored in the same set of neurons in the model. Consequently, during incremental training, even if some of the model weights that store the previously seen class information for a particular view get overwritten, the information of the previous classes for the other views may still remain intact in the other model weights. Therefore, the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the model predictions is different for different data augmentations used during training. Based on this, we present an Augmentation-based Prediction Rectification (APR) approach to reduce the impact of catastrophic forgetting in the FSCIL setting. APR can also augment other FSCIL approaches and significantly improve their performance. We also propose a novel feature synthesis module (FSM) for synthesizing features relevant to the previously seen classes without requiring training data from these classes. FSM outperforms other generative approaches in this setting. We experimentally show that our approach outperforms other methods on benchmark datasets. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different from deep learning with large scale supervision, few-shot learning aims to learn the samples' characteristics from few labeled examples. Apparently, few-shot learning is more in line with the visual cognitive mechanism of the human brain. In recent years, few-shot learning has attracted more researchers' attention. They all assume that each category only contains a few labeled samples and without unlabeled samples during the few-shot training. However, in reality, each visual categories also includes some unlabeled samples which store rich semantic information. Labeling all unlabeled samples is timeconsuming and laborious. Therefore, we combine the few-shot learning and active learning together, and propose an active few-shot learning model (AC-FSL) based on prototype network. This model includes two core modules: few-shot classification module and loss prediction module. The former is used for classification task under few labeled samples, while the latter is applied to choose some unlabeled samples of high value for labeling, and then assist for the few-shot classification task. We conduct extensive experiments on two image benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed model AC-FSL can effectively im prove the classification performance of current methods on few-shot setting.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NETWORKS
AB Fooling images are potential threats to deep neural networks (DNNs). These images cannot be recognized by humans as natural objects, e.g., dogs and cats. However, they are misclassified by DNNs as natural object classes with high confidence scores. Despite their original design concept, existing fooling images, if closely examined, can be seen to retain some features that are characteristic of the target objects. Hence, DNNs can react to these features. In this study, we evaluate whether fooling images with no characteristic pattern of natural objects, either locally or globally, can exist. As a minimal case, we introduce single-color images with a few pixels altered, called sparse fooling images (SFIs). We first prove that SFIs always exist under mild conditions for linear and nonlinear models and reveal that complex models are more likely to be vulnerable to SFI attacks. Using two SFI generation methods, we demonstrate that in deeper layers, SFIs have features similar to those of natural images. Therefore, they fool DNNs successfully. Among the other layers, we discover that the max-pooling layer causes vulnerability to SFIs. The defense against SFIs and transferability are also discussed. This study highlights a new vulnerability of DNNs by introducing a novel class of images that are distributed extremely far from natural images. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing in industry as well as usage of vehicles for transporting products generate many problems to the environment such as greenhouse gas emission and global warming. As nowadays environmental pollution has become a crucial problem, production companies have now shifted their attention to lower the carbon emission level along with their financial goal. In reality, the values of some parameters such as production cost, holding cost, demand rate, deterioration rate may not fixed due to several factors. Reworking of defective products reduces production cost. This study aims at developing a multi-objective supply chain inventory management by considering deteriorating products together with imperfect quality production under neutrosophic environment. Several carbon reduction policies such as carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade and carbon cap-and-offset and green technology are implemented here to mitigate the influence of carbon emission by curbing amount of carbon emission. To reduce the deterioration rate, preservation technology is utilized. In real-world situations, all parameters related to an inventory management are not handled as a crisp value, a fuzzy number or an intuitionistic fuzzy number. To confrontation this issue, single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic number is chosen for investigating this type of an inventory problem. A ranking approach is designed to transform all uncertain parameters into deterministic values. A comparison between two types of reworking processes, and a comparison among crisp, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic models are drawn. A sensitivity analysis regarding important parameters is also taken into consideration to accentual managerial intuitions.

AB State-of-the-art workflows within Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) are still caught in sequential planning processes. Digital design tools in this domain often lack proper communication between different stages of design and relevant domain knowledge. Furthermore, decisions made in the early stages of design, where sketching is used to initiate, develop, and communicate ideas, heavily impact later stages, resulting in the need for rapid feedback to the architectural designer so they can proceed with adequate knowledge about design implications. Accordingly, this paper presents research on a novel integrative design framework based on a recently developed 4D sketching interface, targeted for architectural design as a formfinding tool coupled with three modules: (1) a Geometric Modelling module, which utilises Points2Surf as a machine learning model for automatic surface mesh reconstruction from the point clouds produced by sketches, (2) a Material Modelling module, which predicts the mechanical properties of biocomposites based on multiscale micromechanics homogenisation techniques, and (3) a Structural Analysis module, which assesses the mechanical performance of the meshed structure on the basis of the predicted material properties using finite element simulations. The proposed framework is a step towards using material-informed design already in the early stages of design.

ID DOMAIN ADAPTION; ALGORITHM
AB In an era of parallel computing, evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMT) has become a popular optimization paradigm due to its ability to optimize several tasks simultaneously. The common knowledge can improve the solving quality and efficiency for each component optimization task when transferred among tasks. Therefore, the performances of traditional EMT algorithms mostly rely on the correlation between tasks. In the field of EMT, a key issue needing to be solved urgently is the impact of negative transfer when tackling optimization tasks with low correlation. In order to overcome the short board of this situation, this paper proposes a multiobjective EMT algorithm EMT-GFK. In the proposed algorithm, a union subspace of the optimization tasks is designed to extract the compact information. Furthermore, the geodesic flow kernel based domain adaptation is applied to learn a nonlinear mapping matrix, which can increase the correlation between tasks. The numerical experiments and results analysis on the MO-MTO test suits demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed EMT-GFK.

AB Collaborative robots (cobots) are being applied in areas such as healthcare, rehabilitation, agriculture and logistics, beyond the typical manufacturing setting. This is leading to a marked increase in the number of cobot stakeholders with little or no experience in traditional safety engineering. Considering the importance of human safety in collaborative robotic applications, this is currently proving to be a barrier to more widespread cobot usage. A web-based Toolkit that targets cobot end-users and manufacturers with varying levels of safety expertise was developed, helping them to understand how to consider the safety of their cobot applications. In this work, we will provide an overview of the state of the art for ensuring cobot safety, highlight the support provided by the "COVR Toolkit" and introduce three examples where third parties applied the Toolkit for their collaborative robotics application.

AB The advancement of virtual reality technology has ushered in new developments in the medical field. The use of virtual surgery training simulators alleviates the paucity of training resources and high training expenses associated with traditional surgical capabilities. Regardless of the type of schooling, doctors must continue to educate themselves. The postoperative evaluation mechanism is incomplete. Traditional objective evaluation indicators are unable to meet surgeons' stringent expectations. The electroencephalograph (EEG) rhythm index is proposed in this article as a new tool for evaluating and distinguishing between novice and expert doctors. The experiment uses a cutting training module from neurosurgery training and compares it with established assessment metrics to determine the correct rate of classification of new evaluation metrics, classifying testers by both metrics and finding a 20% increase in correctness. Additionally, this article compares the energy topographic maps of different EEG rhythms of novices and experts. For classification, two-machine learning algorithms, SVM and random forest, are utilized at the same time. The findings reveal that the accuracy of distinguishing indicators based on EEG cycles is 10% higher than that of typical objective evaluation indicators, regardless of the categorization method. ROC curve analysis was also used to compare the two classification models. The AUC value for the EEG rhythm evaluation index model was 0.971, whereas the AUC value for the classic objective evaluation index model was 0.761, which explains the EEG rhythm evaluation index. The model demonstrates a categorization standard that is reliable.

AB In this study, we define team agility as a function of exploration and exploitation of team coordination. Based on these two coordination concepts, we examined interactive decision-making in a dynamic task environment by applying: first, the principles of quantum cognition for the decision-making processes at the confluence of teamwork and taskwork (to discern the effects of ontic uncertainty for each human team member in the case of having incomplete teamwork) and second, nonlinear dynamical systems modeling for the teamwork (to capture epistemic uncertainty). In this study, there were the following three conditions based on manipulation of the pilot role: first, synthetic condition-the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, second, control condition-it was a randomly assigned participant, and third, experimenter condition-it was an expert who used a role-specific coordination script. Overall findings indicate that when teams in the experimenter condition come across the targets, they tend to explore alternatives by coordinating as a team rather than exploiting existing team strategies, which may not work best for the situation at hand. In contrast, teams in control and synthetic conditions tended more toward exploitation than exploration in coordination. We consider this a sign of agility in teamwork.

TI Asynchronous Remote Usability Tests Using Web-Based Tools Versus
   Laboratory Usability Tests: An Experimental Study
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Comparison study; web-based asynchronous remote tests; website usability
   evaluation
AB Remote usability testing is performed by evaluators who are in different physical locations from the participants (synchronous remote testing) and possibly operating at different times (asynchronous remote testing). The tools developed in recent years to support remote tests exploit web technology based on HTML5 and JavaScript ES6 and thus enable previously unexplored scenarios. However, studies providing evidence on the benefits or drawbacks of utilizing recent web-based tools have not yet been reported in the literature. This article sheds some light on the impact of such tools on asynchronous remote usability testing of websites by reporting an experimental study with 100 participants and 15 evaluators to compare real-time laboratory tests with asynchronous remote tests. The study investigates: 1) how the metrics results of asynchronous remote usability tests performed through a web-based tool differ from those of usability tests conducted in real-time laboratory settings; and 2) how the experience of participants differs in the two types of tests. The lessons learned in the study are instrumental in informing the design of future tools. Some results of particular interest indicate that the web technology used by the tool for asynchronous remote testing affects task execution times and participants' satisfaction. Another indication is that slow internet connections must be managed in asynchronous remote testing; slow connections introduce delays when transferring large amounts of collected data, which, together with the lack of human support, make participants of asynchronous remote tests more prone to feel negative emotions.

TI Enhancing Screen Reader Intelligibility in Noisy Environments

DT Article
DE Speech compensation; visual impairments
AB People with blindness or severe low vision access mobile devices using screen readers. However, noisy environments can impair screen reader intelligibility. During mobility, this could disorient or even endanger the user. To address this issue, we propose three screen reader speech compensation techniques based on environmental noise: speech rate slowing, adaptive volume increase, and adaptive equalization. Through a study with 12 participants in three simulated noise scenarios, we evaluate screen reader intelligibility and the perceived distraction from the soundscape, with and without compensations. Four of the proposed compensations, in particular those that pair speech rate reduction with volume or equalization adaptation, significantly improve screen reader's speech intelligibility in all the considered scenarios, and the compensations do not have a significant impact on the distraction from the soundscape.

AB The article proposes a plural learning framework combining the ingredients found in a tribunal for the derivation of a more generalized artificial intelligence (GAI) when starting from a specialized set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This framework involves at least two different training stages called, respectively, specialization and generalization. In the specialization stage, any CNN considered in a given set learns to predict independently of other elements of the set. In the second stage called generalization, an integration network learns to predict from assessment measures fed by downstream specialized CNNs. The assessment measures considered are categorical softmax probabilities and learning to judge from these assessments relies on independent CNNs. Generalization proof of concepts is provided in terms of multimodel, multimodal, and distributed schemes. The multimodel framework is such that different CNN models operating on the same modality cooperate for decision purpose. The multimodal framework implies specializations of CNN with respect to different input modalities. The distributed framework proposed is associated with assessment exchanges: it such that the aggregation aims at determining relevant joint assessments for mapping a given input to a single or a multiple output category. The performance of these aggregation frameworks is shown to be outstanding for both standard and extreme classification issues.

TI Boosting Zero-Shot Learning via Contrastive Optimization of Attribute

DT Article; Early Access
DE Index Terms- Attributes; contrastive learning; prototype gen-eration;
   transformer; zero-shot learning (ZSL)
AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize classes that do not have samples in the training set. One representative solution is to directly learn an embedding function associating visual features with corresponding class semantics for recognizing new classes. Many methods extend upon this solution, and recent ones are especially keen on extracting rich features from images, e.g., attribute features. These attribute features are normally extracted within each individual image; however, the common traits for features across images yet belonging to the same attribute are not emphasized. In this article, we propose a new framework to boost ZSL by explicitly learning attribute prototypes beyond images and contrastively optimizing them with attribute-level features within images. Besides the novel architecture, two elements are highlighted for attribute representations: a new prototype generation module (PM) is designed to generate attribute prototypes from attribute semantics; a hard-example-based contrastive optimization scheme is introduced to reinforce attribute-level features in the embedding space. We explore two alternative backbones, CNN-based and transformer-based, to build our framework and conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB), SUN attribute database (SUN), and animals with attributes 2 (AwA2). Results on these benchmarks demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/dyabel/CoAR-ZSL.git.

AB Traditional support vector machines (SVMs) are fragile in the presence of outliers; even a single corrupt data point can arbitrarily alter the quality of the approximation. If even a small fraction of columns is corrupted, then classification performance will inevitably deteriorate. This article considers the problem of high-dimensional data classification, where a number of the columns are arbitrarily corrupted. An efficient Support Matrix Machine that simultaneously performs matrix Recovery (SSMRe) is proposed, i.e. feature selection and classification through joint minimization of l(2,1) (the nuclear norm of L). The data are assumed to consist of a low-rank clean matrix plus a sparse noisy matrix. SSMRe works under incoherence and ambiguity conditions and is able to recover an intrinsic matrix of higher rank in the presence of data densely corrupted. The objective function is a spectral extension of the conven-tional elastic net; it combines the property of matrix recovery along with low rank and joint sparsity to deal with complex high-dimensional noisy data. Furthermore, SSMRe leverages structural information, as well as the intrinsic structure of data, avoiding the inevitable upper bound. Experimental results on different real-time applications, supported by the theoretical analysis and statistical testing, show significant gain for BCI, face recognition, and person identification datasets, especially in the presence of outliers, while preserving a reasonable number of support vectors.

AB In many automated motion planning systems, vehicles are tasked with tracking a reference path or trajectory that is safe by design. However, due to various uncertainties, real vehicles may deviate from such references, potentially leading to collisions. This paper presents rigorous reachable set bounding methods for rapidly enclosing the set of possible deviations under uncertainty, which is critical information for online safety verification. The proposed approach applies recent advances in the theory of differential inequalities that exploit redundant model equations to achieve sharp bounds using only simple interval calculations. These methods have been shown to produce very sharp bounds at low cost for nonlinear systems in other application domains, but they rely on problem-specific insights to identify appropriate redundant equations, which makes them difficult to generalize and automate. Here, we demonstrate the application of these methods to tracking problems for the first time using three representative case studies. We find that defining redundant equations in terms of Lyapunov-like functions is particularly effective. The results show that this technique can produce effective bounds with computational times that are orders of magnitude less than the planned time horizon, making this a promising approach for online safety verification. This performance, however, comes at the cost of low generalizability, specifically due to the need for problem-specific insights and advantageous problem structure, such as the existence of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions.

AB With the rapid development of computing technologies, the CAX software are widely used in mechanical engineering. The part model is designed in computer-aided design (CAD) software, the planning process is planned in computer-aided process planning (CAPP) software, and the machining process is simulated in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. However, there are still digital gaps between design, process, and manufacturing, which affect the integration and efficiency of engineering information. Manufacturing features are considered digital carriers that can bridge the gap. The knowledge of design, process, and manufacturing can be integrated on manufacturing features to achieve the information flow across different engineering applications. However, the existing approaches cannot solve the feature recognition problem very well. The recognition criterion of these approaches do not have the generalization ability. And they also do not deal with the interacting features appropriately. To improve the performance of feature recognition of 3-axis milling parts, this paper proposed a hybrid feature recognition framework based on graph approach and rule approach. The hybrid framework solves the recognition problem of interacting features with the layered decomposition method. And the general wire criterion is proposed to improve the robustness. In addition, the general calculation method of adjacency attributes is also the original contribution. The final experimental results show that the proposed hybrid framework works well and can be applied to the actual engineering applications.

AB Prefabricated construction has become one of the most innovative methods to address the pressing housing demands. However, conventional prefabricated construction projects often suffer from challenges of managing numerous paper-based documentation, non-standardized management and intricate stakeholders in construction site management (CSM). The current design approaches lack sufficient consideration of the activity-based user relationships. To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify useractivity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manualinput and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyberphysical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments.

AB Vibration, current, and acoustic signals have different advantages and characteristics in fault diagnosis. Although a few researches have explored their fusion methods and applied them to fault diagnosis fields in recent years, it remains a knotty problem whether the classification results are trustworthy or not. Therefore, in order to facilitate trusted multi-source information fusion learning and deep sensitive fault feature mining, a modified graph convolution network-trusted multi-source information fusion (MGCN-TMIF) framework is designed. First, the modified graph convolution network is used to deeply mine the relationship between samples through the original signals to obtain the nonlinear evidence. Second, the nonlinear evidence is combined with the Dirichlet distribution to obtain the classification probability distribution. Finally, the evidence is integrated by the reduced D-S evidence theory (DST) to obtain the trusted fusion results. The effectiveness of MGCN-TMIF is verified by experimental-level and industrial-level electromechanical coupling equipment datasets, and the results demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed method up to 100 %. The proposed fusion diagnosis method is also verified to have high noise robustness performance through anti-noise experiments.

AB Since the concept of uncertain partial differential equations (UPDEs) was proposed, it has been developed significantly and led us to study parameter estimation for UPDEs. This paper proposes a concept of residual of a class of UPDEs, which follows a linear uncertainty distribution. Afterwards, an a-path of a class of UPDEs is introduced and the important result that the inverse uncertainty distribution of solution of a class of UPDEs is just the a-path of the corresponding UPDEs is reached. And a numerical method is designed to obtain the inverse uncertainty distribution of solution of UPDEs. In addition, based on the a-path and the inverse uncertainty distribution, an algorithm is designed for calculating the residuals of UPDEs corresponding to the observed data. Then a method of moments to estimate unknown parameters in UPDEs is provided. Furthermore, uncertain hypothesis test is recast to evaluate whether an uncertain partial differential equation fits the observed data. Finally, the method of moments is applied to modeling China's population and the fitness of the estimated parameters is verified by using uncertain hypothesis test.

AB Based on subjective possibilistic semantics, an agent's subjective probability mass function is dominated by a qualitative Possibility Mass Function (PossMF), which can also be transformed into a unique consonant mass function. However, the existing transformation method cannot maintain the consistency of combination rules, i.e., fusing PossMFs and consonant mass functions with same information content, respectively, the results no longer maintain the reversible transformation. To address the above issue, a novel belief functions transformation is proposed, which can be interpreted based on both Smets' canonical decomposition and Pichon's canonical decomposition. The proposed method is validated based on consistency of combination rules, the least commitment principle, and its application in the fusion of information. In addition, based on the two canonical decompositions, we extend the transformation to possibilistic belief structure, and offer a new perspective of relationship between possibilistic information and evidential information.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely studied to address graph data representation and learning. In contrast to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that employ many various (spatial) convolution filters to obtain rich feature descriptors to encode complex patterns of image data, GCNs, however, are defined on the input observed graph G(X, A) and usually adopt the single fixed spatial convolution filter for graph data feature extraction. This limits the capacity of the existing GCNs to encode the complex patterns of graph data. To overcome this issue, inspired by depthwise separable convolution and DropEdge operation, we first propose to generate various graph convolution filters by randomly dropping out some edges from the input graph A. Then, we propose a novel graph-dropping convolution layer (GDCLayer) to produce rich feature descriptors for graph data. Using GDCLayer, we finally design a new end-to-end network architecture, that is, a graph-dropping convolutional network (GDCNet), for graph data learning. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GDCNet.

AB Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation analysis technique that is widely used in statistics and the machine-learning community. However, the high complexity involved in the training process lays a heavy burden on the processing units and memory system, making CCA nearly impractical in large-scale data. To overcome this issue, a novel CCA method that tries to carry out analysis on the dataset in the Fourier domain is developed in this article. Appling Fourier transform on the data, we can convert the traditional eigenvector computation of CCA into finding some predefined discriminative Fourier bases that can be learned with only element-wise dot product and sum operations, without complex time-consuming calculations. As the eigenvalues come from the sum of individual sample products, they can be estimated in parallel. Besides, thanks to the data characteristic of pattern repeatability, the eigenvalues can be well estimated with partial samples. Accordingly, a progressive estimate scheme is proposed, in which the eigenvalues are estimated through feeding data batch by batch until the eigenvalues sequence is stable in order. As a result, the proposed method shows its characteristics of extraordinarily fast and memory efficiencies. Furthermore, we extend this idea to the nonlinear kernel and deep models and obtained satisfactory accuracy and extremely fast training time consumption as expected. An extensive discussion on the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-CCA is made in terms of time and memory efficiencies. Experimental results on several large-scale correlation datasets, such as MNIST8M, X-RAY MICROBEAM SPEECH, and Twitter Users Data, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art (SOTA) large-scale CCA methods, as our proposed method achieves almost same accuracy with the training time of our proposed method being 1000 times faster. This makes our proposed models best practice models for dealing with large-scale correlation datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/Mrxuzhao/FFTCCA.

AB With shaped reward functions, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been successfully applied to several robot control tasks. However, designing a task-relevant and well-performing reward function takes time and effort. Still, if RL can train an agent to complete a task in a sparse reward environment, it is an effective way to address the difficulty of reward function design, but it is still a significant challenge. To address this issue, the pioneering hindsight experience replay (HER) method dramatically enhances the probability of acquiring skills in sparse reward environments by transforming unsuccessful experiences into helpful training samples. However, HER still requires a lengthy training period. In this article, we propose a new technique based on HER termed adaptive HER with goal-amended curiosity module (AHEGC) for further enhancing sample and exploration efficiency. Specifically, an adaptive adjustment strategy of hindsight experience (HE) sampling rate and reward weights is developed to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce a curiosity mechanism to encourage more efficient exploration of the environment and propose a goal-amended (GA) curiosity module as a solution to the problem of over-seeking novelty caused by the curiosity introduced. We conducted experiments on six demanding robot control tasks with binary rewards, including Fetch and Hand environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods regarding learning ability and convergence speed.

ID ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; APPROXIMATION
AB Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with expensive constraints pose stiff challenges to existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in a very limited computational cost, due to the fact that the number of expensive constraints for an MOP is often large. For existing SAEAs, they always approximate constraint functions in a single granularity, namely, approximating the constraint violation (CV, coarse-grained) or each constraint (fine-grained). However, the landscape of CV is often too complex to be accurately approximated by a surrogate model. Although the modeling of each constraint function may be simpler than that of CV, approximating all the constraint functions independently may result in tremendous cumulative errors and high computational costs. To address this issue, in this article, we develop a multigranularity surrogate modeling framework for evolutionary algorithms (EAs), where the approximation granularity of constraint surrogates is adaptively determined by the position of the population in the fitness landscape. Moreover, a dedicated model management strategy is also developed to reduce the impact resulting from the errors introduced by constraint surrogates and prevent the population from trapping into local optima. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, an implementation called K-MGSAEA is proposed, and the experimental results on a large number of test problems show that the proposed framework is superior to seven state-of-the-art competitors.

AB To learn the embedding representation of graph structure data corrupted by noise and outliers, existing graph structure learning networks usually follow the two-step paradigm, i.e., constructing a "good"graph structure and achieving the message passing for signals supported on the learned graph. However, the data corrupted by noise may make the learned graph structure unreliable. In this paper, we propose an adaptive graph convolutional clustering network that alternatively adjusts the graph structure and node representation layer-by-layer with back-propagation. Specifically, we design a Graph Structure Learning layer before each Graph Convolutional layer to learn the sparse graph structure from the node representations, where the graph structure is implicitly determined by the solution to the optimal self-expression problem. This is one of the first works that uses an optimization process as a Graph Network layer, which is obviously different from the function operation in traditional deep learning layers. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is given to solve the optimal self-expression problem in the Graph Structure Learning layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively defend the negative effects of inaccurate graph structures.

AB Computer vision technologies are receiving much attention for automatic site monitoring. However, previous approaches mainly focused on two-dimensional (2D) pixel information, and there was a limit to providing detailed three-dimensional (3D) pose information. Some studies have built a training database only using virtual models, but there were still limitations in representing the actual equipment. To address these limitations, the authors propose a method for estimating 3D poses of equipment from single camera images by integrating virtual models. The proposed method consists of three main processes: (1) 2D - 3D annotation using a virtual model; (2) preprocessing for pose estimation in two ways (i.e., image matching or key points detection); and (3) 3D pose localization. As a result, the root mean square error for the 3D pose of construction equipment was 1.49 m (using image matching) and 1.56 m (using key points detection). The results imply that the proposed method successfully estimated the 3D pose of the equipment with a single camera. The findings of this study can contribute to detailed productivity or safety analysis based on more diverse 3D information than 2D pixel-based analysis.

AB Many infrastructure assets in transportation such as roads and bridges represent challenges for inspection and maintenance due to advanced age, structural deficiencies and modifications. Concepts such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) aim to alleviate the problem of health monitoring and asset management by providing digital building models constructed from survey data to all stakeholders. Ageing and oftentimes poorly-documented infrastructure objects such as bridges in particular benefit from a continuous integration of changes to form a digital twin which reflects the asset's as-is state. However, the process of reconstructing geometric-semantic models from survey data is a manual and labour-intensive process and makes continuously updating the models a difficult task. To automate this process, a cross-domain approach using an artificial neural network is presented which performs semantic segmentation in the image domain and transfers the results over to the point cloud. For the following fine segmentation, geometric knowledge in the 3D domain is used for post-processing and filtering via geometric reasoning. Using this method, a 3D semantic segmentation is achieved which does not require any 3D point cloud training data and only a low amount of image training data.

AB Motivated by the service-oriented intelligent maintenance activity under the development of the digital economy, we study the operation and maintenance strategies of the Maintenance Scheduling and Technician Routing Problem (MSTRP) for medical equipment implemented by multi-skilled technicians. We consider the maintenance services provided for both preventive maintenance (PM, e.g., periodic maintenance based on the contract schedule) and corrective maintenance (CM, e.g., repair action in the event of a sudden breakdown). As these activities are performed on equipment with various types of requirements at different geographically distributed systems, technicians with diverse qualifications need to build teams and visit the matching maintenance requests. Meanwhile, we consider the maintenance actions concerning the dynamic change in equipment failure rate and establish a flexible maintenance mechanism by balancing the total cost. This paper develops an efficient hybrid heuristic based on a genetic algorithm, variable neighborhood search, and other optimization strategies to solve this multi-period equipment maintenance scheduling and multi-skilled technician routing and scheduling problem. Based on the settings of the studied MSTRP, this paper designs different sizes of testing instances and multi-period explanatory cases before conducting extensive comparative experiments and sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic maintenance strategy and optimization method.

AB Complex evidence theory (CET) is an effective method for uncertainty reasoning in knowledge-based systems with good interpretability that has recently attracted much attention. However, approaches to improve the performance of uncertainty reasoning in CET-based expert systems remains an open issue. One key to performance improvement is the adequate management of conflict from multisource information. In this paper, a generalized correlation coefficient, namely, the complex evidential correlation coefficient (CECC), is proposed for the complex mass functions or complex basic belief assignments (CBBAs) in CET. On this basis, a complex conflict coefficient is proposed to measure the conflict between CBBAs; when CBBAs turn into classic BBAs, the complex correlation and conflict coefficients will degrade into traditional coefficients. The complex conflict coefficient satisfies nonnegativity, symmetry, boundedness, extreme consistency, and insensitivity to refinement properties, which are desirable for conflict measurement. Several numerical examples validate through comparisons the superiority of the complex conflict coefficient. In this context, a weighted discounting multisource information fusion algorithm, which is called the CECC-WDMSIF, is designed based on the CECC to improve the performance of CET-based expert systems. By applying the CECC-WDMSIF method to the pattern classification of diverse real-world datasets, it is demonstrated that the proposed CECC-WDMSIF outperforms well-known related approaches with higher classification accuracy and robustness.

TI A Learned Index for Exact Similarity Search in Metric Spaces
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Learned index; multi-dimension; metric space
AB Indexing is an effective way to support efficient query processing in large databases. Recently the concept of learned index, which replaces or complements traditional index structures with machine learning models, has been actively explored to reduce storage and search costs. However, accurate and efficient similarity query processing in high-dimensional metric spaces remains to be an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing approach called LIMS that uses data clustering, pivot-based data transformation techniques and learned indexes to support efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces. In LIMS, the underlying data is partitioned into clusters such that each cluster follows a relatively uniform data distribution. Data redistribution is achieved by utilizing a small number of pivots for each cluster. Similar data are mapped into compact regions and the mapped values are totally ordinal. Machine learning models are developed to approximate the position of each data record on disk. Efficient algorithms are designed for processing range queries and nearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for index maintenance with dynamic updates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of LIMS compared with traditional indexes and state-of-the-art learned indexes.

AB Causal feature selection has received increasing attention in recent years. However, the state-of-the-art causal feature selection algorithms use the conditional independence tests, which require enumerating conditioning sets, leading to an exponential increase in computational complexity along with an increase in feature space. To address this problem, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the unique performance of causal features in mutual information, and propose a novel Causal Feature Selection algorithm using Mutual Information, called CFS-MI. Specifically, CFS-MI separately instantiates the pairwise comparison of mutual information in two stages to reduce computational complexity, and thus improves the efficiency on high-dimensional data. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark Bayesian networks and 16 real-world datasets validate that CFS-MI has comparable accuracy compared to 7 state-of-the-art causal feature selection algorithms, while presenting more superior computational efficiency.

AB In the 5G era, data traffic has been growing rapidly. A small number of popular data files may dominate the network traffic and lead to heavy network congestion. Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can be used for caching and offloading significant data traffic. D2D social networks are instantiated paradigms of D2D communication. Existing studies maximize the performances of caching and offloading in D2D social networks by predicting potential content propagation paths. However, predicting such paths still faces many challenges, such as limitation of user spatial-temporal features, fragility of D2D social networks, and uncertainty of participants. As a solution, we first measure users' multi-dimensional features and content propagation paths to explore the distributions of D2D activities. Then we propose a D2D-LSTM model to predict complete content propagation paths hierarchically and design a prototype-user model for new participants. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performances of D2D-LSTM. D2D-LSTM achieves at most 95% and at least 84.6% average precision in predicting terminal prototype-user class. Tree generation tests show that the generated trees have at most 64% and at least 17% similarity with ground-truth trees.

   Forecasting
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

   multi-task learning
AB Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes, such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction procedure.

AB The minimum path pair (MPP) query problem is to find the optimal meeting point of two minimum paths for two users in a network, where each user's minimum path has its own departure and destination nodes. However, the MPP query problem on a time-varying network that generally exists in the world remains open. In this study, we investigate the time-varying minimum path pair (TMPP) query problem, where the arcs of the network are time dependent. We first model the TMPP and then propose a time impulse neural network (TINN) to solve the TMPP. In the design of the TINN, the entire network topology is considered as the architecture of the neural network, and each node is viewed as a neuron. The core of an impulse-based neuron consists of six parts: input, impulse receiver, time window selector, neuron storage, impulse sender, and output. Unlike the traditional neural network, the whole neural network does not require a training process but is implemented through an impulse mechanism. The TINN consists of two stages; the first stage is to find the two minimum paths of two users, while the second stage is to calculate the distance between these two minimum paths. The underlying idea of the TINN is to find the minimum path using an impulse mechanism. The minimum path relies on the earliest time impulse stemming from the depart node that arrives at the destination node. With this mechanism, both the minimum path of the network and the distance between two paths can be addressed. Furthermore, theoretical analysis demonstrates the correctness and provides the complexity of the TINN. Experiments of the TINN are carried out based on the well-known New York City Map. A comparative study illustrates the effectiveness of the TINN.

ID COMMUNITY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Though there are several works about adversarial attack and defense strategies on domains such as images and natural language processing, it is still difficult to directly transfer the learned knowledge to graph data due to its representation structure. Given the importance of graph analysis, an increasing number of studies over the past few years have attempted to analyze the robustness of machine learning models on graph data. Nevertheless, existing research considering adversarial behaviors on graph data often focuses on specific types of attacks with certain assumptions. In addition, each work proposes its own mathematical formulation, which makes the comparison among different methods difficult. Therefore, this review is intended to provide an overall landscape of more than 100 papers on adversarial attack and defense strategies for graph data, and establish a unified formulation encompassing most graph adversarial learning models. Moreover, we also compare different graph attacks and defenses along with their contributions and limitations, as well as summarize the evaluation metrics, datasets and future trends. We hope this survey can help fill the gap in the literature and facilitate further development of this promising new field(1).

AB We focus on the problem of aligning graphs that have a spatial basis. In such graphs, which we refer to as rigid graphs, nodes have preferred positions relative to their graph neighbors. Rigid graphs can be used to abstract objects in diverse applications such as large biomolecules, where edges corresponding to chemical bonds have preferred lengths, functional connectomes of the human brain, where edges corresponding to co-firing regions of the brain have preferred anatomical distances, and mobile device/ sensor communication logs, where edges corresponding to point-to-point communications across devices have distance constraints. Effective analysis of such graphs must account for edge lengths in addition to topological features. For instance, when identifying conserved patterns through graph alignment, it is important for matched edges to have correlated lengths, in addition to topological similarity. In this paper, we formulate the problem of rigid graph alignment and present a method for solving it. Our formulation of rigid graph alignment simultaneously aligns the topology of the input graphs, as well as the geometric structure represented by the edge lengths, which is solved using a block coordinate descent technique. Using detailed experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate a number of important desirable features of our method: (i) it significantly outperforms topological and structural aligners on a wide range of problems; (ii) it scales to problems in important real-world applications; and (iii) it has excellent stability properties, in view of noise and missing data in typical applications.

AB Ranking nodes in a multiplex network is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks in network analysis. Generalizing centrality measures to multiplex networks is an active area of research. The Multiplex PageRank model is an extension of Google's PageRank, which introduces a new centrality measure to extend the usual PageRank to multiplex networks. In this work, we focus on the Multiplex PageRank problem. First, based on the special structure of the Multiplex PageRank problem, we propose an inverse-free block-SOR method. Second, with the help of randomly sampling, we propose a new strategy for estimating the optimal relaxation parameter. Specifically, the multiplex network is frequently updated in real world applications, and we have to deal with temporal Multiplex PageRank problems including the incremental and the decremental Multiplex PageRank problems. To the best of our knowledge, however, there are few efficient algorithms for solving these type of problems. To fill-in this gap, the third contribution of this work is to propose both incremental and decremental algorithms for solving the temporal Multiplex PageRank problems. Comprehensive numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the numerical behavior of the proposed algorithms, and show the effectiveness of our new strategies.

AB Online service providers benefit from collecting and analyzing preference data from users, including both implicit preference data (e.g., watched videos of a user) and explicit preference data (e.g., ranking data over candidates). However, it brings ethical and legal issues of data privacy at the same time. In this paper, we study the problem of aggregating individual's preference data in the local differential privacy (LDP) setting. One naive approach is to add Laplace random noises, which however suffers from low statistical utility and is fragile to LDP-specific poisoning attacks. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism to improve the utility and the robustness simultaneously: the additive mechanism. The additive mechanism randomly outputs a subset of candidates with a probability proportional to their total scores. For preference data with Borda rule over d items, its mean squared error bound is optimized from O(d(5)/ne(2)) to O(d(4)/ne(2)),and its maximum poisoning risk bound is reduced from +8 to O(d(2)/ne). We also theoretically investigate minimax lower bounds of e-LDP preference data aggregation, and prove the error rate of O(d(4)/ne(2)) is optimal for the Borda rule. Experimental results validate that our proposed approaches averagely reduce estimation error by 50% and are more robust to adversarial poisoning attacks.

TI Aspect-Guided Syntax Graph Learning for Explainable Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Explanation generation; explainable recommendation; hierarchical graph
   pooling
AB Explainable recommendation systems provide explanations for recommendation results to improve their transparency and persuasiveness. The existing explainable recommendation methods generate textual explanations without explicitly considering the user's preferences on different aspects of the item. In this paper, we propose a novel explanation generation framework, namely Aspect-guided Explanation generation with Syntax Graph (AESG), for explainable recommendation. Specifically, AESG employs a review-based syntax graph to provide a unified view of the user/item details. An aspect-guided graph pooling operator is proposed to extract the aspect-relevant information from the review-based syntax graphs to model the user's preferences on an item at the aspect level. Then, an aspect-guided explanation decoder is developed to generate aspects and aspect-relevant explanations based on the attention mechanism. The experimental results on three real datasets indicate that AESG outperforms state-of-the-art explanation generation methods in both single-aspect and multi-aspect explanation generation tasks, and also achieves comparable or even better preference prediction accuracy than strong baseline methods.

TI Attention Over Self-Attention: Intention-Aware Re-Ranking With Dynamic
   Transformer Encoders for Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Item re-ranking; user-specific prediction; user intention modeling;
   dynamic transformer
AB Re-ranking models refine item recommendation lists generated by the prior global ranking model, which have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving the recommendation quality. However, most existing re-ranking solutions only learn from implicit feedback with a shared prediction model, which regrettably ignore inter-item relationships under diverse user intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel Intention-aware Re-ranking Model with Dynamic Transformer Encoder (RAISE), aiming to perform user-specific prediction for each individual user based on her intentions. Specifically, we first propose to mine latent user intentions from text reviews with an intention discovering module (IDM). By differentiating the importance of review information with a co-attention network, the latent user intention can be explicitly modeled for each user-item pair. We then introduce a dynamic transformer encoder (DTE) to capture user-specific inter-item relationships among item candidates by seamlessly accommodating the learned latent user intentions via IDM. As such, one can not only achieve more personalized recommendations but also obtain corresponding explanations by constructing RAISE upon existing recommendation engines. Empirical study on four public datasets shows the superiority of our proposed RAISE, with up to 13.95%, 9.60%, and 13.03% relative improvements evaluated by Precision@5, MAP@5, and NDCG@5 respectively.

TI Authorized Update in Multi-User Homomorphic Encrypted Cloud Database
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

ID ACCESS-CONTROL
AB Cloud Computing is a promising solution in distributed internet computing for IT and scientific research. However, data storage and computing in the cloud domain raise added questions in terms of security. Data encrypted with traditional encryption schemes may confirm confidentiality, but computation in cloud domain becomes infeasible. This paper focuses on designing an encrypted database considering homomorphic encryption (HE) as an underlying scheme so that query execution is carried out on encrypted version of the database without any need of intermediate decryption. Existing encrypted databases are either based on partial HE or deterministic HE to achieve practical performance; hence, they are either limited in terms of types of query execution or prone to known attacks. To mitigate these issues, we explore the practical challenges of a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based database design. FHE theoretically promises to perform arbitrary operations on encrypted data. However, realizing any algorithm in homomorphic domain requires a circuit-based representation of that specific algorithm, which is a non-trivial task. In this work, we explore the practical challenges of FHE database design, mostly in the case of multi-user organizational scenarios, and propose a scheme for secure modification or conditional update of the encrypted database. Moreover, when an organization outsources a database to the cloud, a single FHE key is used to encrypt all columns of the database. However, all users(or employees) of the same organization should not have equal read and write access permission to the whole database. In this work, we propose an architecture to apply Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) on FHE databases with minimum overhead in terms of performance and storage. We propose required changes in registration, login, and user revocation phases for our scheme to perform conditional SQL query processing on FHE encrypted database (EDB). Our proposed framework is capable of performing end-to-end encrypted conditional UPDATE with suitable access control within 17 minutes on a multi-core processor platform for 769 rows and 9 columns of database size with 16-bit size of data. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed technique is the first one in literature to support arbitrary secure encrypted SQL query execution with suitable access control.

AB Prediction and control of spreading processes in social networks (SNs) are closely tied to the underlying connectivity patterns. Contrary to most existing efforts that exclusively focus on positive social user interactions, the impact of contagion processes on the temporal evolution of signed SNs (SSNs) with distinctive friendly (positive) and hostile (negative) relationships yet, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the interplay between social link polarity and propagation of viral phenomena coupled with user alertness. In particular, we propose a novel energy model built on Heider's balance theory that relates the stochastic susceptible-alert-infected-susceptible epidemic dynamical model with the structural balance of SSNs to substantiate the trade-off between social tension and epidemic spread. Moreover, the role of hostile social links in the formation of disjoint friendly clusters of alerted and infected users is analyzed. Using three real-world SSN datasets, we further present a time-efficient algorithm to expedite the energy computation in our Monte-Carlo simulation method and show compelling insights on the effectiveness and rationality of user awareness and initial network settings in reaching structurally balanced local and global network energy states.

AB Geo-social group queries, which return a social cohesive user group with a spatial constraint, have receive significant research interests due to their promising applications for group-based activity planning and scheduling in location-based social networks (LBSNs). However, existing studies on geo-social group queries mostly assume the users are stationary whereas in realistic LBSN application scenarios all users may continuously move over time. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the problem of continuous geo-social groups monitoring (CGSGM) over moving users. A challenge in answering CGSGM queries over moving users is how to efficiently update geo-social groups when users are continuously moving. To address the CGSGM problem, we first propose a baseline algorithm, namely Baseline-BB, which recomputes the new geo-social groups from scratch at each time instance by utilizing a branch and bound (BB) strategy. To improve the inefficiency of BB, we explore a new strategy, called common neighbor or neighbor expanding (CNNE), which expands the common neighbors of edges or the neighbors of users in intermediate groups to quickly produce the valid group combinations. Accordingly, another baseline algorithm, namely Baseline-CNNE, is proposed. As these baseline algorithms do not maintain intermediate results to facilitate further query processing, we develop an incremental algorithm, called incremental monitoring algorithm (IMA), which maintains the support, common neighbors and the neighbors of current users when exploring possible user groups for further updates and query processing. Since IMA requires many times of truss decomposition when processing mutiple-users updates, we propose an improved incremental algorithm, called improved incremental monitoring algorithm (IIMA), which performs truss decompostion only once. Moreover, we design algorithms for handling the social changes that result in insertion/deletion of some edges in the social network. Owing to the challenge in setting, an appropriate monitoring distance, we further study the top $N$N CGSGM problem, which finds top $N$N result groups at each time instance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using four real datasets to validate our ideas and evaluate the proposed algorithms.

AB The cold-start problem is a major factor that limits the effectiveness of recommendation systems. Having too few available interaction records brings a series of challenges when predicting user preferences. At present, there are two main kinds of strategies for solving this problem from different perspectives. One is cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which introduces additional information by domain knowledge propagation with transfer learning. However, CDR methods follow traditional training processes in machine learning and cannot solve this typical few-shot problem from the perspective of optimization. The other type of methods that has recently emerged is based on meta-learning. Most of these approaches focus only on generating a meta-model to perform better on new tasks and ignore improvements based on cross-domain information. Therefore, it is necessary to design a novel approach to solve this problem with both domain knowledge and meta-optimization. To achieve this goal, a novel cross-domain meta-learner for cold-start recommendation (MetaCDR) is proposed. In MetaCDR, we design a domain knowledge meta-transfer module to connect different domain networks. In addition, we introduce a pretraining strategy to ensure its efficiency. The experimental results show that MetaCDR performs significantly better than state-of-the-art models in a variety of scenarios.

AB Tracing a student's knowledge is vital for tailoring the learning experience. Recent knowledge tracing methods tend to respond to these challenges by modelling knowledge state dynamics across learning concepts. However, they still suffer from several inherent challenges including: modelling forgetting behaviors and identifying relationships among latent concepts. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model, namely Deep Graph Memory Network (DGMN). In this model, we incorporate a forget gating mechanism into an attention memory structure in order to capture forgetting behaviors dynamically during the knowledge tracing process. Particularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting features over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further, this model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts from a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student's evolving knowledge states. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been conducted using four well-established benchmark datasets. The results show that DGMN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models over all the datasets. The effectiveness of modelling forgetting behaviors and learning latent concept graphs has also been analyzed in our experiments.

ID DEPENDENCE
AB Self-supervised learning for graph neural networks has attracted considerable attention and shows notable successes in graph representation learning. However, the formation of a real-world graph typically arises from highly complex interactions of many latent factors. The existing self-supervised learning methods for GNNs are inherently holistic and neglect the entanglement of the latent factors, resulting in suboptimal learned representations for downstream tasks and difficult to be interpreted. Learning disentangled graph representations with self-supervised learning poses great challenges and remains largely ignored by the existing literature. In this paper, we introduce Independence Promoted Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDGCL) method, which can learn disentangled graph-level representations with self-supervision. In particular, we first identify the latent factors of the input graph and derive its factorized representations. Then we propose a factor-wise discrimination objective in a contrastive learning manner, which can force the factorized representations to independently reflect the expressive information from different latent factors. To further promote the independence between the representations, we employ the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to eliminate the dependence among different representations, which is effectively integrated into the self-supervised framework as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against several state-of-the-art baselines.

TI Disentangled Graph Neural Networks for Session-Based Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Disentangled representation learning; graph neural networks;
   session-based recommendation
AB Session-based recommendation (SBR) has drawn increasingly research attention in recent years, due to its great practical value by only exploiting the limited user behavior history in the current session. The key of SBR is to accurately infer the anonymous user purpose in a session which is typically represented as session embedding, and then match it with the item embeddings for the next item prediction. Existing methods typically learn the session embedding at the item level, namely, aggregating the embeddings of items with or without assigned attention weights to items. However, they ignore the fact that a user's intent on adopting an item is driven by certain factors of the item (e.g., the leading actors of an movie). In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity interests of users at the factor level to generate the session embedding, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address the problem, we propose a novel method called Disentangled Graph Neural Network (Disen-GNN) to capture the session purpose with the consideration of factor-level attention on each item. Specifically, we first employ the disentangled learning technique to cast item embeddings into the embeddings of multiple factors, and then use the gated graph neural network (GGNN) to learn the embedding factor-wisely based on the item adjacent similarity matrix computed for each factor. Moreover, the distance correlation is adopted to enhance the independence between each pair of factors. After representing each item with independent factors, an attention mechanism is designed to learn user intent to different factors of each item in the session. The session embedding is then generated by aggregating the item embeddings with attention weights of each item's factors. To this end, our model takes user intents at the factor level into account to infer the user purpose in a session. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods.

DE Disentangled embedding; geographical effect; graph neural networks;
   point-of-Interest recommendation
ID REPRESENTATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has drawn a lot of attention in both academia and industry. It utilizes user check-in data, aiming at recommending unvisited POIs to users. To address the data-sparsity problem, geographical information of POIs is often incorporated into recommender systems. However, most of the existing approaches model geographical impact in an implicit way, in which geographical information is encoded as auxiliary vectors for learning unified representations of users and POIs. Following this paradigm, the embedding of POIs can not reflect geographical similarity directly; thus, an explicit modeling approach is needed as geography is of great importance in POI recommendation. To address challenges in disentangling geographical effect, we proposed a disentangled representation learning method named DIG (short for Disentangled embedding of user Interest and POIs' Geographical information). Aiming at decoupling the geographical factor and the user interest factor thoroughly, we first proposed a geo-constrained negative sampling strategy, which helps to find reliable negative samples for the two factors. Second, a geo-enhanced soft-weighted loss function was proposed to quantify the trade-off between the two factors in loss computation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, and results have demonstrated the significant improvement of DIG at 3.92% similar to 20.32% on recall, and 2.53% similar to 11.48% on hit ratio, compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI Distribution Knowledge Embedding for Graph Pooling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Graph neural network; distribution knowledge embedding; graph pooling;
   graph classification
AB Graph-level representation learning is the pivotal step for downstream tasks that operate on the whole graph. The most common approach to this problem is graph pooling, where node features are typically averaged or summed to obtain the graph representations. However, pooling operations like averaging or summing inevitably cause severe information missing, which may severely downgrade the final performance. In this article, we argue what is crucial to graph-level downstream tasks includes not only the topological structure but also the distribution from which nodes are sampled. Therefore, powered by existing Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we propose a new plug-and-play pooling module, termed as Distribution Knowledge Embedding (DKEPool), where graphs are viewed as distributions on top of GNNs and the pooling goal is to summarize the entire distribution information instead of retaining a certain feature vector by simple predefined pooling operations. A DKEPool network de facto disassembles representation learning into two stages, structure learning and distribution learning. Structure learning follows a recursive neighborhood aggregation scheme to update node features where structure information is obtained. Distribution learning, on the other hand, omits node interconnections and focuses more on the distribution depicted by all the nodes. Extensive experiments on graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed DKEPool significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI Effective Clustering via Structured Graph Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Clustering; block diagonal similarity matrix; structured graph learning;
   adaptive neighbors
AB Given an affinity graph of data samples, graph-based clustering aims to partition these samples into disjoint groups based on the affinities, and most previous works are based on spectral clustering. However, two problems among spectral-based methods heavily affect the clustering performance. First, the randomness of post-processing procedures, such as $K$K-means, affects the stability of clustering. Second, the separated stages of spectral-based methods, including graph construction, spectral embedding learning, and clustering decision, lead to mismatched problems. In this paper, we explore a structured graph learning (SGL) framework that aims to fuse these stages to improve clustering stability. Specifically, SGL adaptively learns a structured affinity graph that contains exact $k$k connected components. Each connected component corresponds to a cluster so clustering assignments can be directly obtained according to the connectivity of the learned graph. In this way, SGL avoids the randomness brought by reliance on traditional post-processing procedures. Meanwhile, the graph construction and structured graph learning procedures happen simultaneously, which alleviates the mismatched problem effectively. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the involved optimization problems and discuss the connections between this work and previous works. Numerical experiments on several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

TI Efficient Maximum Edge-Weighted Biclique Search on Large Bipartite

DE Maximum edge-weighted biclique; upper bound; vertex order; heuristic;

ID SETS
AB Given a bipartite graph, the maximum edge biclique problem (MEB) aims to find a biclique with the largest number of edges. MEB is a fundamental problem with many real applications, such as community analysis, E-commerce services and bioinformatics. However, in some scenarios, the weight of an edge reflects valuable and important information on the relationship between two entities. Motivated by this, in this paper, we investigate the problem of maximum edge-weighted biclique search (MEWB), which finds a biclique with the largest total weight of edges in a weighted bipartite graph. MEWB has many real applications, including item recommendation, fraud detection, gene clustering, etc. Although we show that MEWB can be resolved by adapting the search algorithm designed for MEB, the performance of this method is yet unsatisfactory. To improve the computation efficiency, two optimizations in terms of upper bound and search order are proposed. For the upper bound, we consider the degree distribution for vertices in the candidate set, and thus have a chance to discard a few edges to tighten the upper bound. For search order, we theoretically show that a vertex order generating the most similar search depth on vertices can achieve the least time cost for MEWB. Guided by this fact, we propose the global summation vertex order. To further accelerate the computation, we extend our approach to a parallel environment, and develop a heuristic approach to deal with large-scale graphs by slightly sacrificing the answer quality. Extensive performance studies conducted on real datasets demonstrate that our proposals can significantly outperform the baseline method by up to two orders of magnitude. Besides, our heuristic approach gives the optimal result on 8 out of 10 real datasets, while achieving more than an order of magnitude of speed-up.

ID ALGORITHM; INDEX; TREES
AB Let G(V, E) be a digraph (directed graph) with n nodes and e arcs. Digraph G* = (V, E*) is the reflexive, transitive closure if v -> u is an element of E* iff there is a path from v to u in G. Efficient storage of G* is important for supporting reachability queries which are not only common in graph databases, but also serve as fundamental operations used in many graph algorithms. A lot of strategies have been proposed based on the graph labeling, by which each node is assigned with certain labels such that the reachability of any two nodes through a path can be determined by their labels. Among them are interval labeling, chain decomposition, 2-hop labeling, and path-trees, as well as partial index based methods. However, due to the very large size of many real world graphs, the computational cost and size of labels using existing methods would prove too expensive to be practical. In this paper, we propose a new approach to deduct and decompose a graph into a series of spanning trees and transform a query q to a series of subqueries each evaluated against a spanning tree. Using the so-called tree labeling, each subquery needs only O(1) time. More importantly, the number of such subqueries is << n. Thus, q can be evaluated very efficiently. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. While the query time of our method is orders of magnitude better than almost all the existing strategies, its indexing time and index sizes are comparable to them.

AB Significant progress has been made by joint entity and relation extraction methods, which directly generate the relation triplets and mitigate the issue of overlapping relations. However, previous models generate the entity-relation triplets solely from input sentences. Such information is insufficient to support the modeling of interactive information between entities and relations. In this paper, we define the features that provide mutual supports for entity and relation detection but can only be accessed at training time as privileged features for relation extraction, and devise two teacher models to exploit privileged entity and relation features, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel contrastive student-teacher learning framework for joint extraction of entities and relations (STER), where a student network is encouraged to amalgamate privileged knowledge from two expert teacher networks that additionally utilize the privileged features, based on contrastive learning. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets (i.e., ADE, SciERC and CoNLL04) demonstrate that STER has robust superiority over competitors and sets state-of-the-art. For reproducibility, we release the data and source code at: https://github.com/siat-nlp/STER.

ID MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHMS; APPROXIMATION; MATRICES
AB The Tucker Decomposition (TKD) is able to provide the low-dimensional and informative representations of real-world large-scale tensorial data, which are necessary to extract potential features and enhance the original data. However, computing such decomposition directly for a dense tensor is usually computationally elusive, due to the repetitive operations of computing large-scale tensor-matrix product. Instead of direct decomposition, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm for seeking the Faster TKD of the large-scale tensor, which is a lightweight decomposition approach based on the technique of randomized sampling. The proposed algorithm first converts the original large-scale tensor into a small-scale subtensor via full-mode sampling operation, and then the core tensor of TKD can be computed directly based on the subtensor with low complexity. Finally, an approximate TKD of the original large-scale tensor can be obtained after sequentially computing approximate full-mode factor matrices. A theoretical error analysis is provided to show that the approximation error approximates zero with high probability, and the proposed algorithm is verified based on real tensorial data of $23821.24GB$23821.24GB.

   recommender system
AB The sparse interactions between users and items on the web have aggravated the difficulty of their representations in recommender systems. Existing approaches leverage item attributes (e.g., item categories and tags) to alleviate the data sparsity problem, so as to enhance the performance and interpretability of recommendation. However, directly using all attributes of items cannot avoid the negative impacts of low-quality attributes, where manually labeling the quality of attributes is time-consuming. To this end, we propose HQRec to jointly measure the quality of attributes automatically and perform recommendation accurately. Specifically, we first analyze the different qualities among item attributes, and propose to leverage item categories to select high-quality tags via category-guided quality measurement and direction-aware optimization in an unsupervised fashion. Then, we propose to capture the complex relations among users and items based on the high-quality attributes, where a novel quality-aware embedding fusion and quality-aware embedding propagation mechanism for users and items is devised. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show drastic performance gains brought by our proposed HQRec framework, which constantly achieves an average of 14.73% improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Recall and NDCG metrics. Insightful case studies also show that our automatic quality measurements are highly accurate and interpretable.

ID EDGE BICLIQUE; NETWORKS; SEARCH
AB Bipartite graphs are widely used to capture the relationships between two types of entities. In bipartite graph analysis, finding the maximum balanced biclique (MBB) is an important problem with numerous applications. A biclique is balanced if its two disjoint vertex sets are of equal size. However, in real-world scenarios, each vertex is associated with a weight to denote its properties, such as influence, i.e., weighted bipartite graph. For weighted bipartite graphs, the previous studies for MBB are no longer applicable due to the ignorance of weight. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a reasonable definition of "balance" by restricting the weight difference between two sides of a biclique within k. Given a weighted bipartite graph G and a constraint k, we aim to find the maximum k-balanced biclique (Max k BB) with the maximum weight. To address the problem, we first propose an approach based on biclique enumeration on single side of G following the Branch-and-Bound framework. To improve the performance, we further devise three optimization strategies to prune invalid search branches. Moreover, we utilize graph reduction strategy to reduce the redundant search space. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 real bipartite datasets to demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and scalability of our proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that our algorithms can address MBB detection problem efficiently, and the case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our model compared with MBB model.

DE Contrastive self-supervision; fine-grained urban flow inference;
   spatio-temporal data
AB As a critical task of the urban traffic services, fine-grained urban flow inference (FUFI) benefits in many fields including intelligent transportation management, urban planning, public safety. FUFI is a technique that focuses on inferring fine-grained urban flows depending solely on observed coarse-grained data. However, existing methods always require massive learnable parameters and the complex network structures. To reduce these defects, we formulate a contrastive self-supervision method to predict fine-grained urban flows taking into account all correlated spatial and temporal contrastive patterns. Through several well-designed self-supervised tasks, uncomplicated networks have a strong ability to capture high-level representations from flow data. Then, a fine-tuning network combining with three pre-training encoder networks is proposed. We conduct experiments to evaluate our model and compare with other state-of-the-art methods by using two real-world datasets. All the empirical results not only show the superiority of our model against other comparative models, but also demonstrate its effectiveness in the resource-limited environment.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Node embedding; network representation learning; free energy distance;
   matrix factorization
ID ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK
AB A widely established set of unsupervised node embedding methods can be interpreted as consisting of two distinctive steps: i) the definition of a similarity matrix based on the graph of interest followed by ii) an explicit or implicit factorization of such matrix. Inspired by this viewpoint, we propose improvements in both steps of the framework. On the one hand, we propose to encode node similarities based on the free energy distance, which interpolates between the shortest path and the commute time distances, thus, providing an additional degree of flexibility. On the other hand, we propose a matrix factorization method based on a loss function that generalizes that of the skip-gram model with negative sampling to arbitrary similarity matrices. Compared with factorizations based on the widely used l(2) loss, the proposed method can better preserve node pairs associated with higher similarity scores. Moreover, it can be easily implemented using advanced automatic differentiation toolkits and computed efficiently by leveraging GPU resources. Node clustering, node classification, and link prediction experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating free-energy-based similarities as well as the proposed matrix factorization compared with state-of-the-art alternatives.

TI GCCAD: Graph Contrastive Coding for Anomaly Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Graph neural network; anomaly detection; contrastive learning
AB Graph-based anomaly detection has been widely used for detecting malicious activities in real-world applications. Existing attempts to address this problem have thus far focused on structural feature engineering or learning in the binary classification regime. In this work, we propose to leverage graph contrastive learning and present the supervised GCCAD model for contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of their distances to the global context (e.g., the average of all nodes). To handle scenarios with scarce labels, we further enable GCCAD as a self-supervised framework by designing a graph corrupting strategy for generating synthetic node labels. To achieve the contrastive objective, we design a graph neural network encoder that can infer and further remove suspicious links during message passing, as well as learn the global context of the input graph. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets, demonstrating that 1) GCCAD significantly and consistently outperforms various advanced baselines and 2) its self-supervised version without fine-tuning can achieve comparable performance with its fully supervised version.

ID SUPPORT; STYLE
AB Machine learning systems generally assume that the training and testing distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e., out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category. Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our open-sourced codebase for fair evaluation. Finally, we summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for the future.

ID DATA IMPUTATION
AB Incomplete instances with various missing values in real-world scenes have brought challenges to the classification tasks. Many existing methods impute the incomplete instances based on their neighbouring instances before classification. However, the construction of such neighbourhood relationships in the original data space may become unreliable since missing values could disturb the traditional distance measurement. Moreover, these methods decouple the imputation from the classification, which makes it difficult for the former to learn from the supervised information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To this end, this paper proposes graph neural networks for missing values classification (GNN4MV), which directly classify the incomplete instances based on their neighbourhood relationships constructed in a novel task-driven metric space. Specifically, the supervised information is taken as additional guidance in a task-driven metric space to reduce the impact of the missing values for neighbourhood relationship construction. Furthermore, a novel neighbourhood graph convolutional network is proposed in GNN4MV, which enables direct classification of the incomplete instances without imputation by utilizing the graph topology in the constructed neighbourhood relationships. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

DE Multi-label data stream; classification; high-dimensional data; feature
   selection; concept drift
ID MUTUAL INFORMATION
AB Multi-label data streams such as Web texts and images have been popular on the Web. These data present the characteristics of multiple label, high dimensionality, high volume, high velocity and especial concept drift etc. Thus, multi-label data stream classification is a very challenging and significant task especially in the handling of high-dimensional data with concept drifts. However, this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Therefore, we propose the max-relevance and min-redundancy based algorithm adaptation approach for the efficient and effective classification on multi-label data streams with high-dimensional attributes and concept drifts. In order to reduce the impact from the high-dimensional data with noisy attributes, we first refine the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion based on mutual information to select qualified features in multi-label data streams. Second, we propose the data distribution based concept drifting detection approach to distinguish concept drifts hidden in data streams. Finally, we build an incremental ensemble classification model for efficiently classifying multi-label data streams. Extensive studies show that our approach can get optimal subsets of features while maintaining a good performance in the multi-label classification, as compared to several state-of-the-art multi-label feature selection algorithms using two efficient multi-label classification methods as base classifiers. Meanwhile, our approach is superior to three well-known multi-label data stream classification approaches in the effectiveness and efficiency.

   rules in machine learning
AB Platforms such as Twitter are increasingly being used for real-world event detection. Recent work often leverages event-related keywords for training machine learning based event detection models. These approaches make strong assumptions on the distribution of the relevant microposts containing the keyword - referred to as the expectation - and use it as a posterior regularization parameter during model training. Such approaches are, however, limited by the informativeness of the keywords and by the accuracy of the expectation estimation for keywords. In this work, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to jointly discover informative rules for model training while estimating their expectation. Our approach iteratively leverages the crowd to estimate both rule-specific expectation and the disagreement between the crowd and the model in order to discover new rules that are most beneficial for model training. To identify such rules, we introduce a hybrid human-machine workflow that engages human workers in rule discovery through an interactive hypothesis creation and testing interface and leverages automatic methods for suggesting useful rules for human verification. We empirically demonstrate the merits of our approach, on multiple real-world datasets and show that our approach improves the state of the art by a margin of 25.63% in terms of AUC.

TI HyperISO: Efficiently Searching Subgraph Containment in Hypergraphs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

ID ALGORITHM; ORDER
AB Searching subgraph containment, also called subgraph matching in hypergraphs, is to enumerate all the embeddings of a data hypergraph with a given query hypergraph, which plays an important role in the analysis of hypergraph-modeled applications. However, existing subgraph matching frameworks mainly focus on pairwise graphs and the existing techniques can not efficiently be applied to search subgraph containment at low costs. Therefore, this paper proposes HyperISO to efficiently search subgraph containment that consists of three parts: 1) new filtering techniques driven by exploring the properties and connections of hyperedges to reduce unpromising products for the sake of low matching costs, 2) a novel ordering strategy that is able to generate an optimized matching process by considering both the sizes of hyperedge candidates and the unmatched vertices of the hyperedges, and 3) a dual enumeration algorithm to list both the vertex and hyperedge mappings. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data show that HyperISO outperforms the best among the sophisticated subgraph matching frameworks and meanwhile verify the efficiency of HyperISO in various types of hypergraphs.

TI Incomplete Multiview Clustering Using Normalizing Alignment Strategy
   With Graph Regularization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Feature alignment; incomplete multiview; normalizing strategy; pairwise
   co-regularization
ID SCALE
AB Matrix factorization has demonstrated promising performance in the incomplete multiview clustering (IMC) tasks. However, many algorithms require feature normalization operations to ensure the stability of model results, so either the convergence is unstable, or the objective function cannot fit the data well. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel IMC algorithm using a normalizing alignment strategy (IMCNAS) based on nonnegative matrix factorization. Specifically, the columns of the basis matrices are constrained into unit vector space, which integrates the feature normalization and the optimizing process, and makes the model converge fast and stable. On the other hand, this enables the model to fit the data better and produce more reasonable factorization results. Further, we develop a novel pairwise co-regularization to align incomplete multiple views more directly, without introducing a common consensus matrix like traditional centroid-based co-regularization. Graph regularization is also incorporated in the proposed model to utilize the geometrical information of data. We implement IMCNAS with a centroid-based regularization and a pairwise co-regularization respectively, and leads to two variants, i.e., IMCNAS-1 and IMCNAS-2. Both variants are optimized with multiplicative updating rules. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world datasets comparing several state-of-the-art IMC methods verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

DE Counterfactual; bias; recommender systems; knowledge distillation;
   uniform data
AB The bias problems in recommender systems are an important challenge. In this paper, we focus on solving the bias problems via uniform data. Previous works have shown that simple modeling with a uniform data can alleviate the bias problems and improve the performance. However, the uniform data is usually few and expensive to collect in a real product. In order to use the valuable uniform data more effectively, we propose a novel and general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation with four specific methods, including label-based distillation, feature-based distillation, sample-based distillation and model structure-based distillation. Moreover, we discuss the relation between the proposed framework and the previous works. We then conduct extensive experiments on both public and product datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed four methods. In addition, we explore and analyze the performance trends of the proposed methods on some key factors, and the changes in the distribution of the recommendation lists. Finally, we emphasize that counterfactual modeling with uniform data is a rich research area, and list some interesting and promising research topics worthy of further exploration.

TI Learning Linear and Nonlinear Low-Rank Structure in Multi-Task Learning

DT Article
DE Multi-task learning; tensor trace norm; low-rank structure
AB As the trace norm can discover low-rank structures in a matrix, it has been widely used in multi-task learning to recover the low-rank structure contained in the parameter matrix. Recently, with the emerging of big complex datasets and the popularity of deep learning techniques, tensor trace norms have been used for deep multi-task models. However, existing tensor trace norms exhibit some limitations. For example, they cannot discover all the low-rank structures in a tensor, they require users to manually specify the importance of each component in the corresponding tensor trace norm, and they only capture the linear low-rank structure. To solve the first issue, in this paper, we propose a Generalized Tensor Trace Norm (GTTN). The GTTN is defined as a convex combination of matrix trace norms of all possible tensor flattenings and hence it can discover all the possible low-rank structures. For the second issue, in the induced objective function with the GTTN, we propose four strategies to learn combination coefficients in the GTTN. Furthermore, we propose the Nonlinear GTTN (NGTTN) to capture nonlinear low-rank structure among all the tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GTTN and NGTTN.

DT Article

   explainability
AB State-of-the-art entity matching (EM) methods are hard to interpret, and there is significant value in bringing explainable AI to EM. Unfortunately, most popular explainability methods do not work well out of the box for EM and need adaptation. In this paper, we identify three challenges of applying local post hoc feature attribution methods to entity matching: cross-record interaction effects, non-match explanations, and variation in sensitivity. We propose our novel model-agnostic and schema-flexible method LEMON that addresses all three challenges by (i) producing dual explanations to avoid cross-record interaction effects, (ii) introducing the novel concept of attribution potential to explain how two records could have matched, and (iii) automatically choosing explanation granularity to match the sensitivity of the matcher and record pair in question. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more faithful to the matcher and does a better job of helping users understand the decision boundary of the matcher than previous work. Furthermore, user studies show that the rate at which human subjects can construct counterfactual examples after seeing an explanation from our proposed method increases from 54% to 64% for matches and from 15% to 49% for non-matches compared to explanations from a standard adaptation of LIME.

ID PRESERVING RECORD LINKAGE
AB Privacy-preserving estimation of counts of items in streaming data finds applications in several real-world scenarios including word auto-correction and traffic management applications. Recent works of RAPPOR Erlingsson et al. (2014) and Apple's count-mean sketch (CMS) algorithm D. P. T. Apple, (2017) propose privacy preserving mechanisms for count estimation in large volumes of data using probabilistic data structures like counting Bloom filter and CMS. However, these existing methods fall short in providing a sound solution for real-time streaming data applications. Since the size of the data structure in these methods is not adaptive to the volume of the streaming data, the utility (accuracy of the count estimate) can suffer over time due to increased false positive rates. Further, the lookup operation needs to be highly efficient to answer count estimate queries in real-time. More importantly, the local Differential privacy mechanisms used in these approaches to provide privacy guarantees come at a large cost to utility (impacting the accuracy of count estimation). In this work, we propose a novel (local) Differentially private mechanism that provides high utility for the streaming data count estimation problem with similar or even lower privacy budgets while providing: a) fuzzy counting to report counts of related or similar items (for instance to account for typing errors and data variations), and b) improved querying efficiency to reduce the response time for real-time querying of counts. Our algorithm uses a combination of two probabilistic data structures Cuckoo filter and Bloom filter. We provide formal proofs for privacy and utility guarantees and present extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm using real and synthetic English words datasets for both the exact and fuzzy counting scenarios. Our privacy preserving mechanism substantially outperforms the prior work in terms of lower querying time, significantly higher utility (accuracy of count estimation) under similar or lower privacy guarantees, at the cost of communication overhead.

Recent approaches based on meta-learning succeed in alleviating the issue, owing to the fact that these methods have strong generalization, so they can fast adapt to new tasks under cold-start settings. However, these meta-learning-based recommendation models learned with single and spase ratings are easily falling into the meta-overfitting, since the one and only rating r(ui) to a specific item i cannot reflect a user's diverse interests under various circumstances(e.g., time, mood, age, etc), i.e., if r(ui )equals to 1 in the historical dataset, but r(ui) could be 0 in some circumstance. In meta-learning, tasks with these single ratings are called Non-Mutually-Exclusive(Non-ME) tasks, and tasks with diverse ratings are called Mutually-Exclusive(ME) tasks. Fortunately, a meta-augmentation technique is proposed to relief the meta-overfitting for meta-learning methods by transferring Non-ME tasks into ME tasks by adding noises to labels without changing inputs. Motivated by the meta-augmentation method, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain meta-augmentation technique for content-aware recommendation systems (MetaCAR) to construct ME tasks in the recommendation scenario. Our proposed method consists of two stages: meta-augmentation and meta-learning. In the meta-augmentation stage, we first conduct domain adaptation by a dual conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a multi-view information bottleneck constraint, and then apply the learned CVAE to generate ratings for users in the target domain. In the meta-learning stage, we introduce both the true and generated ratings to construct ME tasks that enables the meta-learning recommendations to avoid meta-overfitting. Experiments evaluated in real-world datasets show the significant superiority of MetaCAR for coping with the cold-start user issue over competing baselines including cross-domain, content-aware, and meta-learning-based recommendations.

AB Knowledge tracing (KT) is the task of tracing students' evolving knowledge state during learning, which has improved the learning efficiency. To facilitate KT's development, most existing methods pursue high accuracy of student performance prediction but neglect the consistency between students' dynamic knowledge state with their learning process. Moreover, they focus on learning outcomes at a single learning interaction, while student progress at continuous learning interactions is more instructive. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which captures the evolution of students' knowledge state through monitoring their learning progress. Specifically, we utilize both the positive effect of the learning gain and the negative effect of forgetting in learning to calculate student progress in continuous learning interactions. Then, considering that the rate of progress is student-specific, we extend LPKT to LPKT-S by explicitly distinguishing the individual progress rate of each student. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that LPKT and LPKT-S could obtain more appropriate knowledge states in line with the learning process. Moreover, LPKT and LPKT-S outperform state-of-the-art KT methods on student performance prediction. Our work indicates a promising future research direction for KT, which is highly interpretable and accurate.

TI MSTDB: A Hybrid Storage-Empowered Scalable Semantic Blockchain Database

DE Blockchain database; data sharing; distributed query; index
AB Blockchain has been regarded as a trusted carrier for distributed data storage. With large volumes of valuable data stored on blockchain, data query has become a major requirement. However, the existing blockchains do not provide efficient query functionality because of their deep-rooted chain structure. Blockchain database is a new direction that constructs index on top of blockchain to provide rich query functionalities. The existing works are either insecure because the query process separates from the blockchain consensus, or inscalable because all the data needs to be stored in the block. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic blockchain database called MSTDB. We design a hybrid on/off chain blockchain storage architecture in which the majority of blockchain storage is offloaded to the off-chain storage and a novel index structure named Merkle Semantic Trie (MST) is designed to be a secure and semantic bridge between on- and off-chain. Based on MST, MSTDB provides a variety of semantic query functions including multi-keyword query, range query, Top-K query, and cross-chain query. To improve the performance further, we design some index compression and query preprocessing techniques for MSTDB. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our blockchain database.

AB Streaming Session-Based Recommendation (SSBR) is a challenging problem as user preferences in sessions are continually drifting with sessions generated chronologically. In recent years, some SSBR models have been proposed to address this problem by reservoir technique and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) which help to preserve a representative sketch of the historical data and extract item transition information in sessions. However, there are two critical problems in existing methods: (1) most existing methods only focus on the local session information without exploiting the information of other sessions and users; (2) GNN models in existing SSBR methods are unable to capture the importance of different user features. To address the problems mentioned above, we propose a novel architecture named Global Item and User embedding Assisted Graph Neural Network (GIUA-GNN) for combining the global user and item information in an attentional manner with local session information for the recommendation. We also propose a novel architecture of graph neural network which utilizes the attention mechanism for better extracting the importance of different features of user embeddings named Bi-directed Attentional Graph Convolutional Network (BA-GCN). Extensive experiments on three different sizes of real-world datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our model on metrics MRR and Recall.

AB Cluster ensemble improves the robustness and stability of clustering performances by utilizing multiple solutions. Although traditional cluster ensemble methods have achieved promising performances, they are not adaptive enough to cope with data sets that have multiple levels of complexities. Besides, these methods may contain noisy and redundancy members which have negative effects. To mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-objective filter refinement scheme (MOFRS). First, we perform various clustering methods on different representations of data to generate diverse solutions. Second, we propose a solution filter to select a proper method and reduce the number of initial partitions for a given data set. Third, four stability indices are designed to split instances into stable and unstable groups. Fourth, objective functions based on diversity and quality are utilized to quantify the goodness of base clustering solutions. Finally, we design an improvement oriented multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to optimize these objective functions. Extensive experimental results conducted on 27 real-world data sets show that MOFRS outperforms most cluster ensemble selection methods, and achieves statistically significant improvements, compared with full ensemble methods.

AB Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL) from data is an NP-hard problem. Genetic algorithms are powerful for solving combinatorial optimization problems, but the lack of effective guidance results in slow convergence and low accuracy regarding BNSL. To address this problem, we propose a mutual information (MI) guided genetic algorithm (MIGA) for BNSL in this paper, which uses MI to effectively search BN structures. In the initialization phase of MIGA, the population is generated by adding additional constraints based on MI to reach a higher score without losing diversity. By employing normalized MI and defining the population support, the potential dominance in the population can be identified and then used to design a novel crossover operator in order to preserve the dominant genes with a higher probability. Moreover, with the guidance of MI for removing loops from the structures, infeasible solutions can be handled in a straightforward and practical way. The proposed MIGA is evaluated on eleven well-known benchmark datasets and compared with four GA-based methods and four other state-of-the-art BNSL algorithms. Experimental results show that MIGA outperforms the compared algorithms in convergence and learning accuracy.

ID INFERENCE
AB Noisy labels represent one of the key issues in supervised machine learning. Existing work for label noise reduction mainly takes a probabilistic approach that infers true labels from data distributions in low-level feature spaces. Such an approach is not only limited by its capability to learn high-quality data representations, but also by the low predictive power of data distributions in inferring true classes. To address those problems, we introduce Nessy, a neuro-symbolic system that integrates deep probabilistic modeling and symbolic knowledge for label noise reduction. Our deep probabilistic model infers the true classes of data instances with noisy labels by exploiting data distributions in an underlying latent feature representation space. For data instances where inference is not reliable enough, Nessy extracts symbolic rules and ranks them according to several utility metrics. Top-ranking rules are injected into the deep probabilistic model via expectation regularization, i.e., via a posterior regularization term constraining the class distribution in the objective function. In a real deployment over multiple relation extraction tasks, we demonstrate that Nessy is able to significantly improve the state of the art, by 7% accuracy and 10.7% AUC on average.

TI NeuralCD: A General Framework for Cognitive Diagnosis

ID ITEM RESPONSE THEORY; DINA MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM
AB Cognitive diagnosis is widely applicable in the scenarios where users' cognitive states need to be assessed, such as games and clinical measurement. Especially in intelligent education, which has become increasingly popular recent decades, cognitive diagnosis serves as a fundamental module for discovering the proficiency level of students on specific knowledge concepts. Existing approaches usually mine linear interactions of student exercising process by manually designed function (e.g., logistic function). However, the cognitive interactions between students and exercises is a complex process, and excessive simplifications would lead to under fitting and thus get inaccurate diagnostic results. Besides, the manually designed interaction functions are relatively inflexible and limits their extensibility. This consequently causes lack of consideration about useful non-numerical information in the cognitive process besides response logs. In this article, we propose a general Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NeuralCD) framework as well as several implemented models (a basic implementation NeuralCDM and three extensions), where we project students and exercises to factor vectors and incorporates neural networks to learn the complex exercising interactions. To ensure the interpretability of diagnostic results, which is essential for cognitive diagnosis, we apply an monotonicity assumption to our NeuralCD framework. Moreover, NeuralCD is a general framework and has good extensibility. We show the generality of NeuralCD through proving how it can cover some traditional models. Then, we demonstrate the extensibility of NeuralCD, which benefits future developments. On one hand, we demonstrate content-based extensions where we provide examples of exploring the rich contents of exercise texts (CNCD-Q and CNCD-F). On the other hand, we demonstrate a knowledge-association based extension to show that NeuralCD is flexible for structural adjustments so as to solve specific problems. For instance, we improve the diagnostic results on uncovered knowledge concepts of a student by extending NeuralCD with the knowledge associations consideration (KaNCD). Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of NeuralCD framework with both accuracy and interpretability.

ID MODEL
AB We address the problem of online change detection in multivariate datastreams, and we introduce QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (QT-EWMA), a nonparametric change-detection algorithm that can control the expected time before a false alarm, yielding a desired Average Run Length (ARL(0)). Controlling false alarms is crucial in many applications and is rarely guaranteed by online change-detection algorithms that can monitor multivariate datastreams without knowing the data distribution. Like many change-detection algorithms, QT-EWMA builds a model of the data distribution, in our case a QuantTree histogram, from a stationary training set. To monitor datastreams even when the training set is extremely small, we propose QT-EWMA-update, which incrementally updates the QuantTree histogram during monitoring, always keeping the ARL(0) under control. Our experiments, performed on synthetic and real-world datastreams, demonstrate that QT-EWMA and QT-EWMA-update control the ARL(0) and the false alarm rate better than state-of-the-art methods operating in similar conditions, achieving lower or comparable detection delays.

AB The fast increase in ad-blocker usage has resulted in significant revenue loss for online publishers. To mitigate this, many publishers implement the Wall strategy, where an adblock user is asked to whitelist the intended webpage. If the user refuses, the result is a loss-loss situation: the user is denied access to content, and the publisher cannot receive revenue. An alternative strategy, called AAX, is to show only acceptable ads to users. However, acceptable ads generate less revenue than regular ads. This article proposes personalized counter ad-blocking that dynamically chooses a counter ad-blocking strategy for individual users. To implement it, we propose a novel deep learning-based whitelist prediction model. Adblock users predicted to whitelist a page receive the Wall strategy; the others receive the AAX strategy. The proposed Deep Ad-Block Whitelist Network (DAWN) for whitelist prediction captures page characteristics, user interests in pages and their sensitivity to ads, reflected in historic behavior, using a deep learning mechanism. Furthermore, DAWN leverages multi-task learning on whitelist prediction and dwell-time prediction to boost performance. DAWN's effectiveness is validated on a real-world dataset provided by Forbes Media. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed counter ad-blocking policy over existing policies on revenue generation and user engagement.

TI PF-HIN:Pre-Training for Heterogeneous Information Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Heterogeneous information network; pre-training; transformer
AB In network representation learning we learn how to represent heterogeneous information networks in a low-dimensional space so as to facilitate effective search, classification, and prediction solutions. Previous network representation learning methods typically require sufficient task-specific labeled data to address domain-specific problems. The trained model usually cannot be transferred to out-of-domain datasets. We propose a self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning framework, PF-HIN, to capture the features of a heterogeneous information network. Unlike traditional network representation learning models that have to train the entire model all over again for every downstream task and dataset, PF-HIN only needs to fine-tune the model and a small number of extra task-specific parameters, thus improving model efficiency and effectiveness. During pre-training, we first transform the neighborhood of a given node into a sequence. PF-HIN is pre-trained based on two self-supervised tasks, masked node modeling and adjacent node prediction. We adopt deep bi-directional transformer encoders to train the model, and leverage factorized embedding parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing to reduce the parameters. In the fine-tuning stage, we choose four benchmark downstream tasks, i.e., link prediction, similarity search, node classification, and node clustering. PF-HIN outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on each of these tasks, on four datasets.

ID ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; TASK ASSIGNMENT
AB In Spatial crowdsourcing, mobile users perform spatio-temporal tasks that involve travel to specified locations. Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is enabled by SC platforms that support mobile worker recruitment and retention, as well as task assignment, which is essential to maximize profits that are accrued from serving task requests. Specifically, how to best achieve task assignment in a cost-effective manner while contending with spatio-temporal constraints is a key challenge in SC. To address this challenge, we formalize and study a novel Profit-driven Task Assignment problem. We first establish a task reward pricing model that takes into account the temporal constraints (i.e., expected completion time and deadline) of tasks. Then we adopt an optimal algorithm based on tree decomposition to achieve an optimal task assignment and propose greedy algorithms based on Random Tuning Optimization to improve the computational efficiency. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we also provide a heuristic task assignment algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization that assigns tasks by simulating behavior of ant colonies foraging for food. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real and synthetic data, offering detailed insight into effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising learning methods for graph-related tasks. However, GNNs are at risk of adversarial attacks. Two primary limitations of the current evasion attack methods are highlighted: (1) The current GradArgmax ignores the "long-term" benefit of the perturbation. It is faced with zero-gradient and invalid benefit estimates in certain situations. (2) In reinforcement learning-based attack methods, the learned attack strategies might not be transferable when the attack budget changes. To this end, we first formulate the perturbation space and propose an evaluation framework and the projective ranking method. We aim to learn a powerful attack strategy then adapt it as little as possible to generate adversarial samples under dynamic budget settings. In our method, based on mutual information, we rank and assess the attack benefits of each perturbation for an effective attack strategy. By projecting the strategy, our method dramatically minimizes the cost of learning a new attack strategy when the attack budget changes. In the comparative assessment with GradArgmax and RL-S2V, the results show our method owns high attack performance and effective transferability. The visualization of our method also reveals various attack patterns in the generation of adversarial samples.

ID LOCAL-COMMUNITY DETECTION
AB Random Walk is a basic algorithm to explore the structure of networks, which can be used in many tasks, such as local community detection and network embedding. Existing random walk methods are based on single networks that contain limited information. In contrast, real data often contain entities with different types or/and from different sources, which are comprehensive and can be better modeled by multiple networks. To take the advantage of rich information in multiple networks and make better inferences on entities, in this study, we propose random walk on multiple networks, RWM. RWM is flexible and supports both multiplex networks and general multiple networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings between networks. RWM sends a random walker on each network to obtain the local proximity (i.e., node visiting probabilities) w.r.t. the starting nodes. Walkers with similar visiting probabilities reinforce each other. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of RWM. Two approximation methods with theoretical performance guarantees are proposed for efficient computation. We apply RWM in link prediction, network embedding, and local community detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RWM.

AB Commonsense knowledge (CSK) about concepts and their properties is helpful for AI applications. Prior works, such as ConceptNet, have compiled large CSK collections. However, they are restricted in their expressiveness to subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples with simple concepts for S and strings for P and O. This paper presents a method called Ascent++ to automatically build a large-scale knowledge base (KB) of CSK assertions, with refined expressiveness and both better precision and recall than prior works. Ascent++ goes beyond SPO triples by capturing composite concepts with subgroups and aspects, and by refining assertions with semantic facets. The latter is essential to express the temporal and spatial validity of assertions and further qualifiers. Furthermore, Ascent++ combines open information extraction (OpenIE) with judicious cleaning and ranking by typicality and saliency scores. For high coverage, our method taps into the large-scale crawl C4 with broad web contents. The evaluation with human judgments shows the superior quality of the Ascent++ KB, and an extrinsic evaluation for QA-support tasks underlines the benefits of Ascent++. A web interface, data, and code can be accessed at https://ascentpp.mpi-inf.mpg.de/.

TI Repulsion-GNNs: Use Repulsion to Supplement Aggregation

   learning
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved prominent performance in the node classification task, by constructing an aggregation process to integrate node features and graph topology. The aggregation process makes the features of the connected nodes similar, which helps to classify. However, this will also cause nodes that are connected but belong to different classes to be more confusing. In this paper, we propose Repulsion-GNNs, in which a repulsion process is introduced to supplement the aggregation process. First, the nodes are divided into hyper nodes based on a basic node classification model. Then, the repulsion for each node can be obtained according to these hyper nodes. Finally, the node embeddings are obtained by combining the aggregation and repulsion. Many existing GNNs can be combined with the repulsion without adding any learnable parameter. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification demonstrate that the repulsion can boost the performance of many GNNs, such as GCN, GAT, SAGE, and GCNII.

ID TIME; NETWORKS
AB Answering spatio-temporal range queries (RQs) on trajectory databases, i.e., finding all trajectories that intersect given ranges, is crucial in many real-world applications. Various kinds of indexes have been proposed to accelerate RQs. However, existing indexes typically use euclidean distance to prune irrelevant regions without concerning the underlying road network information. Nevertheless, as vehicle trajectories are generated on road network edges, the road network could be seen as meta knowledge of trajectories and be used to index and query trajectories. To this end, we propose RP-Tree, a road network-aware partition tree to support efficient RQs. The basic idea is partitioning a road network graph into hierarchical subgraphs and generate a balanced tree structure, where each tree node maintains its associated trajectories. We compactly index the spatio-temporal information of trajectories on the corresponding road network edges. Then, we design efficient search algorithms to support RQs by pruning irrelevant trajectories through subgraph range borders associated with RP-Tree nodes. Last but not least, we scale RP-Tree to very large datasets by devising approximate algorithms with bounded confidence at an interactive speed. Experimental results on three real-world datasets from Porto, Chengdu, and Beijing show that our method outperform baselines by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

ID REPRESENTATION; MINIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Data collected from nature is usually unlabeled, and it is difficult to be used directly. This issue is well addressed by crowdsourcing, which provides a reasonable way for effectively using these unlabeled data. Generally, workers in crowdsourcing tasks are not professionals, so it is hard to obtain high-quality labels. To address this issue, a robust sparse weighted classification algorithm is proposed, which try to adjust the samples that are not correctly classified in the original lables as much as possible. Specifically, we evalute the ability of different workers(indicator weight matrix) to accurately label different samples by fitting the real data matrix to its weighted reconstruction matrix. And then, l(2,1)-norm and worker labeling ability similarity matrix are added, and negative effects of some bad workers are eliminated through the row sparsity property of l(2,1)-norm. Finally, the optimal indicator weight matrix is obtained by optimizing the two matrices in the objective function simultaneously. Therefore, the obtained optimal indicator weight matrix takes the similarity of worker labeling ability into consideration, and infers all the predicted labels. The results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

DE Fuzzy clustering; scalable clustering; anchor graph; trace ratio
AB Fuzzy clustering algorithms have been widely used to reveal the possible hidden structure of data. However, with the increasing of data amount, large scale data has brought genuine challenges for fuzzy clustering. Most fuzzy clustering algorithms suffer from the long time-consumption problem since a large amount of distance calculations are involved to update the solution per iteration. To address this problem, we introduce the popular anchor graph technique into fuzzy clustering and propose a scalable fuzzy clustering algorithm referred to as Scalable Fuzzy Clustering with Anchor Graph (SFCAG). The main characteristic of SFCAG is that it addresses the scalability issue plaguing fuzzy clustering from two perspectives: anchor graph construction and membership matrix learning. Specifically, we select a small number of anchors and construct a sparse anchor graph, which is beneficial to reduce the computational complexity. We then formulate a trace ratio model, which is parameter-free, to learn the membership matrix of anchors to speed up the clustering procedure. In addition, the proposed method enjoys linear time complexity with the data size. Extensive experiments performed on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the superiority (both effectiveness and scalability) of the proposed method over some representative large scale clustering methods.

AB There are extensive studies focusing on the application scenario that all the bipartite cohesive subgraphs need to be discovered in a bipartite graph. However, we observe that, for some applications, one is interested in finding bipartite cohesive subgraphs containing a specific vertex. In this paper, we study a new query-dependent bipartite cohesive subgraph search problem based on k-wing model, named as personalized k-wing search problem. We study the k-wing equivalence relationship to summarize the edges of a bipartite graph G into groups. Therefore, all the edges of G are segregated into different groups, i.e., k-wing equivalence class, forming an efficient and wing number conserving index called EquiWing-Graph. Further, we propose a more compact index, EquiWing-Tree, which is achieved by using our proposed k-butterfly loose approach and discovered hierarchy properties. These indices are used to expedite the personalized k-wing search with a non-repetitive access to G, which leads to linear algorithms for searching the personalized k-wing. Moreover, we conduct a thorough study on the maintenance of the proposed indices for evolving bipartite graphs. We discover novel properties that help us localize the scope of the maintenance at a low cost. By exploiting the discoveries, we propose novel algorithms for maintaining the two indices, which substantially reduces the cost of maintenance. We perform extensive experimental studies in real-world graphs to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of EquiWing-Graph and EquiWing-Tree compared to the baseline.

TI Semi-Supervised EEG Clustering With Multiple Constraints
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Semi-supervised EEG clustering; connectivity constraints;
   compactness-and-scatter constraint; fairness constraint
AB Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs, or Human-Machine Interfaces, HMIs), diagnosis of neurological disease, rehabilitation, etc, rely on supervised techniques such as EEG classification that requires given class labels or markers. Incomplete or incorrectly labeled or unlabeled EEG data are increasing with the ever-expanding amount of EEG data generated by such applications and the ambiguities these generate degrade the performance of supervised techniques. To address the challenging task of clustering EEG data with limited priori knowledge, we introduce a semi-supervised graph embedding EEG clustering approach termed ConsEEGc with multiple constraints, i.e., label-transformed connectivity constraints that constrains the connection or disconnection among EEG data, compactness-and-scatter constraint that constrains the intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster scatter of EEG clusters, and fairness constraint that constrains the fair ratio of elements between EEG clusters, to make best use of limited priori knowledge of EEG data and to achieve better EEG clustering results. ConsEEGc is conducted with an optimization objective function that integrates pseudo label learning, least-square error minimization and multiple constraints, and it can quickly converge to local optima. The experiments demonstrate that ConsEEGc can efficiently yield good clustering results on various types of real-world EEG datasets, compared to state-of-the-art standard unsupervised and semi-supervised EEG/time series clustering algorithms.

TI Semi-Supervised Entity Alignment via Relation-Based Adaptive
   Neighborhood Matching
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Entity alignment; adaptive neighborhood matching; heterogeneous
   knowledge graphs; knowledge graphs
ID MODEL
AB Many recent studies of Entity Alignment (EA) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to aggregate the neighborhood features of entities and achieve better performance. However, aligned entities in real Knowledge Graphs (KGs) usually have non-isomorphic neighborhood structures due to the different data sources of KGs. Therefore, it is insufficient to simply compare the global direct neighborhood of aligned entities, which may also become a variable for the EA judgment. In this paper, we propose a Relation-based Adaptive Neighborhood Matching method (RANM), which matches larger range and higher confidence neighborhoods for aligned entities based on relation matching instead of alignment seeds. RANM first uses alignment seeds to construct the best relation matching set, and then performs local direct neighborhood matching and feature aggregation on the candidate alignments. To obtain high-quality entity embeddings, we design a variant attention mechanism based on heterogeneous graphs, which considers the heterogeneity of relations in KGs. We also adopt a bi-directional iterative co-training to further improve the performance. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets show our method significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, and is 3.01-11.5% higher than the best-performing baselines in Hits@1. RANM also shows high performance on the long-tailed entities and the dataset with less alignment seeds.

TI Stock Movement Prediction Based on Bi-Typed Hybrid-Relational Market
   Knowledge Graph via Dual Attention Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Bi-typed hybrid-relational market knowledge graph; dual attention
   network; stock movement prediction
AB Stock Movement Prediction (SMP) aims at predicting listed companies' stock future price trend, which is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. Recent financial studies show that the momentum spillover effect plays a significant role in stock fluctuation. However, previous studies typically only learn the simple connection information among related companies, which inevitably fail to model complex relations of listed companies in real financial market. To address this issue, we first construct a more comprehensive Market Knowledge Graph (MKG) which contains bi-typed entities including listed companies and their associated executives, and hybrid-relations including the explicit relations and implicit relations. Afterward, we propose DanSmp, a novel Dual Attention Networks to learn the momentum spillover signals based upon the constructed MKG for stock prediction. The empirical experiments on our constructed datasets against nine SOTA baselines demonstrate that the proposed DanSmp is capable of improving stock prediction with the constructed MKG.

ID SELF-SIMILARITY; COMPLEX; DYNAMICS
AB In this article, we propose a principled framework using Vertex-based and Edge-based uniform generation mechanisms to build stochastic uniform growth tree networks that have a wide range of applications in various fields including physics, engineering, chemistry, ect., and then uncover the associated structural features analytically. When considering vertex-degree distribution, there exist three different classes of forms in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., exponential distribution, power-law distribution along with multiple-point distribution. At meantime, three distinct structural shapes are observed in the study of fractal phenomena, that is, fractal feature, critical phenomenon and non-fractal property. In addition, we obtain the analytical solution to fractal dimension for fractal structure from the probability point of view. More importantly, some well-known models, for instance, Vicsek fractal and T-graph, fall into our framework. Next, we precisely consider two families of stochastic uniform growth tree networks generated through the proposed framework. Specifically, we derive the analytic solution to mean hitting time h71i for measuring efficiency of delivering information on networks in a random-walk-based manner, and find that the introduction of randomness certainly enriches the scaling exponent of quantity h71i. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, which suggests that computer simulations are in good agreement with theoretical analysis.

AB Modern information and communication systems have become increasingly challenging to manage. The ubiquitous system logs contain plentiful information and are thus widely exploited as an alternative source for system management. As log files usually encompass large amounts of raw data, manually analyzing them is laborious and error-prone. Consequently, many research endeavors have been devoted to automatic log analysis. However, these works typically expect structured input and struggle with the heterogeneous nature of raw system logs. Log parsing closes this gap by converting the unstructured system logs to structured records. Many parsers were proposed during the last decades to accommodate various log analysis applications. However, due to the ample solution space and lack of systematic evaluation, it is not easy for practitioners to find ready-made solutions that fit their needs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on log parsing. We begin with an exhaustive taxonomy of existing log parsers. Then we empirically analyze the critical performance and operational features for 17 open-source solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively, and whenever applicable discuss the merits of alternative approaches. We also elaborate on future challenges and discuss the relevant research directions. We envision this survey as a helpful resource for system administrators and domain experts to choose the most desirable open-source solution or implement new ones based on application-specific requirements.

TI Task Variance Regularized Multi-Task Learning

DE Multi-task learning; adversarial multi-armed bandit; task variance

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Multi-task Learning (MTL), which involves the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks, can achieve better performance than learning each task independently. It has achieved great success in various applications, ranging from Computer Vision (CV) to Natural Language Processing (NLP). In MTL, the losses of the including tasks are jointly optimized. However, it is common for these tasks to be competing. When the tasks are competing, minimizing the losses of some tasks increases the losses of others, which accordingly increases the task variance (variance between the task-specific loss); furthermore, it induces under-fitting in some tasks and over-fitting in others, which degenerates the generalization performance of an MTL model. To address this issue, it is necessary to control the task variance; thus, task variance regularization is a natural choice. While intuitive, task variance regularization remains unexplored in MTL. Accordingly, to fill this gap, we study the generalization error bound of MTL through the lens of task variance and propose the task variance matters the generalization performance of MTL. Furthermore, this paper investigates how the task variance might be effectively regularized, and consequently proposes a multi-task learning method based on adversarial multi-armed bandit. The proposed method, dubbed BanditMTL, regularizes the task variance by means of a mirror gradient ascent-descent algorithm. Adopting BanditMTL both in CV and NLP applications is found to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The results of extensive experiments back up our theoretical analysis and validate the superiority of our proposals.

AB Recently, deep learning has been an area of intense research. However, as a kind of computing-intensive task, deep learning highly relies on the scale of GPU memory, which is usually prohibitive and scarce. Although some extensive works have been proposed for dynamic GPU memory management, they are hard to apply to systems with multiple dynamic workloads, such as in-database machine learning systems. In this paper, we demonstrated TENSILE, a method of managing GPU memory in tensor granularity to reduce the GPU memory peak, considering the multiple dynamic workloads. TENSILE tackled the cold-starting and across-iteration scheduling problem existing in previous works. We implemented TENSILE on a deep learning framework built by ourselves and evaluated its performance. The experiment results show that TENSILE can save more GPU memory with less extra overhead than prior works in single and multiple dynamic workloads scenarios.

AB connectivity graphs and similar linked data such as inverted indexes are important components of the information access systems provided by social media and web search services. The Bipartite Graph Partitioning mechanism of Dhulipala et al. [KDD 2016] relabels the vertices of large sparse graphs, seeking to enhance compressibility and thus reduce the storage space occupied by these costly structures. Here we develop a range of algorithmic and heuristic refinements to Bipartite Graph Partitioning (BP) that lead to faster computation of space-reducing vertex orderings whilst continuing to apply the same broad algorithmic paradigm. Using a range of web graph and information retrieval system index data as test cases, we demonstrate an implementation that executes up to approximately four times faster than the baseline implementation we commenced with, while holding compressibility approximately constant. We have also improved the asymptotic execution time of BP by replacing a sorting step by a customized median-finding step.

TI Trust-Aware Multi-Task Knowledge Graph for Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Knowledge graph; multi-task learning; recommender systems; trust graph
AB Data sparsity and cold start problems are common in recommender systems. Adding some side information, such as knowledge graph and users' trust relationship, is an effective method to alleviate these problems. However, few work jointly explore the fine-grained implicit relationships between the external heterogeneous graphs to enhance the recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method named Trust-aware Multi-task Knowledge Graph (TMKG), which uses multi-task learning to integrate two kinds of side information of trust graph and knowledge graph in an end-to-end manner. First, we mine the intra-graph and inter-graph high-order connections through the node propagation and aggregation, and optimize the embedding of nodes through the implicit relationships obtained. Furthermore, through the shared cross unit, the connection relationships between each layer is mined, and the high-order interaction of nodes of different layers is obtained. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and prove that our model has the superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

TI Willingness Maximization for Ego Network Data Extraction in Multiple

ID COMMUNITY SEARCH
AB network (ego network) data are very important for evaluating algorithms and machine learning approaches in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Nevertheless, obtaining the ego network data from OSNs is not a trivial task. Conventional manual approaches are time-consuming, and sometimes the ego network data are quite incomplete because only a small number of users would agree to provide their data. This is because there are two important factors that should be considered simultaneously for this data acquisition task: i) users' willingness to provide their data, and ii) the structure of the ego network. However, addressing the above two factors to obtain the more complete ego network data has not received much research attention. Therefore, in this paper, we address this issue by proposing a family of new research problems. The first proposed problem, named Willingness Maximization for Ego Network Extraction in Online Social Networks (WMEgo), identifies a set of ego networks from a single OSN, such that the willingness of the users to provide their data is maximized. We prove that WMEgo is NP-hard and propose a 1/2 (1- 1/e)-approximation algorithm, named Ego Network Identification with Maximum Willingness (EIMW). Furthermore, we extend the idea of WMEgo to multiple social networks and formulate a new research problem, named Willingness Maximization on Multiple Social Networks for Ego Network Extraction (WM2Ego), which is able to effectively obtain ego network data from multiple social networks simultaneously. We propose a 1/2-approximation algorithm, named Maximum Expansion for UNified EXpenses (MUNEX) for a special case of WM(2)Ego and then design a constant-ratio approximation algorithm to the general WM(2)Ego problem, named Maximum Expansion with Expense Examination (M3E). We conduct two evaluation studies with 672 and 1,052 volunteers to validate the proposed WMEgo and WM2Ego problems, respectively, and show that they are able to obtain much more complete ego network data compared to other baselines. We also perform extensive experiments on multiple real datasets to demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform the other baselines.

TI Zorro: Valid, Sparse, and Stable Explanations in Graph Neural Networks

DE Explainability; graph neural networks; interpretability
AB With the ever-increasing popularity and applications of graph neural networks, several proposals have been made to explain and understand the decisions of a graph neural network. Explanations for graph neural networks differ in principle from other input settings. It is important to attribute the decision to input features and other related instances connected by the graph structure. We find that the previous explanation generation approaches that maximize the mutual information between the label distribution produced by the model and the explanation to be restrictive. Specifically, existing approaches do not enforce explanations to be valid, sparse, or robust to input perturbations. In this paper, we lay down some of the fundamental principles that an explanation method for graph neural networks should follow and introduce a metric RDT-Fidelity as a measure of the explanation's effectiveness. We propose a novel approach Zorro based on the principles from rate-distortion theory that uses a simple combinatorial procedure to optimize for RDT-Fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets reveal that Zorro produces sparser, stable, and more faithful explanations than existing graph neural network explanation approaches.

AB Cable robots are an important class of both parallel and serial robots. Since this kind of robot inherits nonlinear dynamics, designing a nonlinear suboptimal controller such that the robot tracks time-varying trajectories in complex missions to achieve optimal performance is of great importance. In this paper, a nonlinear suboptimal controller is suggested to track time-varying desired trajectories by the cable-suspended planar parallel robots (CSPPRs). For this aim, the mechanical and electromechanical models of the CSPPRs based on Newton's second law are derived. After that, the controller is designed by taking three main steps. At first, a reference model is formulated by paying attention to the desired trajectory. Next, the pseudo-linearization technique is used to rewrite the state-space representation of an augmented system consisting of the robot and the reference model. Finally, a state-dependent Riccati equation is numerically solved to achieve the control law. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by both simulation results and experimental results. The results show that the proposed controller is able to stabilize the closed-loop system while the tracking error converges asymptotically to zero and robust tracking performance is obtained.

AB This paper systematically studies the cooperative area coverage and target tracking problem of multiple-unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs). The problem is solved by decomposing into three sub-problems: information fusion, task assignment, and multi-UAV behavior decision-making. Specifically, in the information fusion process, we use the maximum consistency protocol to update the joint estimation states of multi-targets (JESMT) and the area detection information. The area detection information is represented by the equivalent visiting time map (EVTM), which is built based on the detection probability and the actual visiting time of the area. Then, we model the task assignment problem of multi-UAV searching and tracking multi-targets as a network flow model with upper and lower flow bounds. An algorithm named task assignment minimum-cost maximum-flow (TAMM) is proposed. Cooperative behavior decision-making uses Fisher information as the mission reward to obtain the optimal tracking action of the UAV. Furthermore, a coverage behavior decision-making algorithm based on the anti-flocking method is designed for those UAVs assigned the coverage task. Finally, a distributed multi-UAV cooperative area coverage and target tracking algorithm is designed, which integrates information fusion, task assignment, and behavioral decision-making. Numerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve persistent area coverage and cooperative target tracking.

AB Communication between nodes plays a significant role for any system's throughput. Connectivity can be a bottleneck in some architecture, which reduces the computing power. Developing an energy-efficient system and one with great computing capability, unfortunately, is frequently impossible. A routing mechanism for optical networks on nodes (O-NoNs) in this study is presented. The suggested methodology encompasses both the design of the system and the algorithms that operate on it. In order to connect between nodes, these methods are utilized, which removes the need for path reservation criteria and guarantees communication. Our technique produced outstanding results in lowering design computational cost under some criteria. Additionally, this study assessed our findings using artificial traffic patterns including hot spot and random uniform traffic. In terms of fewer hops connecting networks, 100% network usage, which excludes ideal nodes, and quicker algorithm number of iterations, the suggested methodology offers superior outcomes and raises the design's energy efficiency. These results could increase computational NoNs and receiving antennas simultaneously.

ID INFORMATION; REPRESENTATION
AB Formation of a human iris is mainly determined by anatomical characteristics that are identity-related and stable for personal recognition. However, existing deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)-based iris recognition methods fail to make fully use of such anatomical structure. To address this issue, we propose a dual attention block, dubbed unified global radial and angular attention (UGRAA), which focuses on both global radial and angular correlations of iris texture by aggregating the global contexts. The UGRAA is a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module, suitable for commonly used ConvNets in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, for better characterizing spatial relationships between iris regions, we introduce pair-wise spatial correlations via second-order pooling. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed network, which is called UGRAA-Net, on four challenging iris recognition benchmarks. The results verify that our UGRAA-Net consistently outperforms its counterparts, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

AB Much progress has been made in siamese tracking, primarily benefiting from increasing huge training data. However, very little attention has been really paid to the role of huge training data in learning an effective siamese tracker. In this study, we undertake an in-depth analysis of this issue from a novel optimization perspective, and observe that training data is particularly adept at background suppression, thereby refining target representation. Inspired by this insight, we present a data-free siamese tracking algorithm named SiamDF, which requires only a pre-trained backbone and no further fine-tuning on additional training data. Particularly, to suppress background distractors, we separately improve two branches of siamese tracking by retaining the pure target region as target input with the removal of template background, and by exploring an efficient inverse transformation to maintain the constant aspect ratio of target state in search region. Besides, we further promote the center displacement prediction of the entire backbone by eliminating its spatial stride deviations caused by convolution-like quantification operations. Our experimental results on several popular benchmarks demonstrate that SiamDF, free from both offline fine-tuning and online update, achieves impressive performance compared to well-established unsupervised and supervised tracking methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This research aims to investigate synchronization issues in coupled memristive neural networks (CMNNs) using both the static and dynamic edge-event triggered control protocols. An interval parameter system is developed by integrating the concept of Filippov solution with differential inclusion theory. Unlike existing work, the suggested edge-event triggered mechanisms don't require the constant information transfer among neighboring nodes, providing a more distributed control approach that reduces system resources since each node communicates asynchronously. Additionally the absence of Zeno behavior at any given moment supports the efficacy of the approach. To demonstrate its viability, a practical simulation example is presented.

AB Researchers have been proposing different matching frameworks for cancelable template design to improve the matching performance and security of biometric authentication systems. Despite the advantages provided by these systems, they are often vulnerable to different attacks due to their templates' invertible nature. This study utilized an iterative perturbation stochastic approximation procedure to analyze the irreversible order-based encoding approach used in cancelable biometric template transformation. The strategy begins by exploiting the scores corresponding to the encoded words, then a mixed variable-based iterative perturbation is used to generate independent random elements and consequently the corresponding template from the scores. The strategy exploits the vulnerability of three different cancelable systems it has tested, demonstrating that other techniques of similar nature fall short of the security standard for attack mitigation that cancelable biometric systems require. After analyzing the reasons that exploit the system's vulnerability, we use a parameterized thresholding non-uniform quantization as a countermeasure to boost the system's robustness while maintaining a balanced performance-security trade-off. As a result, the system can evade attacks without significantly hindering its matching performance. Finally, generality and computational complexity evaluations on different modalities and strategies validate the attack's efficacy and realism, respectively.

AB Referring expression comprehension aims to locate a target object in an image described by a referring expression, where extracting semantic and discriminative visual information plays an important role. Most existing methods either ignore attribute information or context information in the model learning procedure, thus resulting in less effective visual features. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Attention Network (MANet) to extract the target attribute information and the surrounding context information simultaneously for the target object, where the Attribute Attention Module is designed to extract the fine-grained visual information related to the referring expression and the Context Attention Module is designed to merge the context information of surroundings to learn more discriminative visual features. Experiments on various common benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Overhead fisheye images; Person detection; Swin transformer;
   Group-equivariant convolution
AB Overhead fisheye images can be used for person detection in intelligent monitoring systems. Unlike horizontal images, people in fisheye cameras are generally distributed in any orientation. When the object is rotated, the feature maps from convolutional neural networks have nonlinear variations and lose many orientation features. Transformer can learn the orientation relationship between features. However, a transformer cannot directly extract orientation features and the effectiveness of detecting small objects needs to be improved. In this paper, We propose a novel rotation-equivariant transformer backbone network, which combines group-equivariant convolution with swin transformer to solve these problems. In our proposed model, the rotationequivariant feature map extracted by group-equivariant convolution contains a large number of orientation features in multiple directions. Aggregates feature in different directions to enhance the communication of orientation features before computing window self-attention. We propose the equivariant-group relation module for evaluating the similarity of the equivariant-group and calculating the aggregation weights. Our network architecture for multi-level receptive field structure can expand the local receptive field to enhance the detection of small objects. The experiments validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on fisheye image datasets MW-R, HABBOF, and CEPDOF. Compared with the swin transformer, the accuracy of our model is improved by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 1.3%, and the accuracy of small object detection in the CEPDOF dataset is improved by 0.73%.

ID CONSENSUS
AB In this article, the event-triggered fixed-time tracking control is investigated for uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems involving state constraints. By employing the universal transformed function (UTF) and coordinate transformation techniques into backstepping design procedure, the proposed control scheme ensures that all states are constrained within the time-varying asymmetric boundaries, and meanwhile, the undesired feasibility condition existing in other constrained controllers can be removed elegantly. Different from the existing static event-triggered mechanism, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is devised via constructing a novel dynamic function, so that the communication burden from the controller to actuator is further alleviated. Furthermore, with the aid of adaptive neural network (NN) technique and generalized first-order filter, together with Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the states of closed-loop system converge to small regions around zero with fixed-time convergence rate. The simulation results confirm the benefits of developed scheme.

AB A significant number of industrial dynamic processes belong to time-varying distributed parameter systems (DPSs). To develop an accurate approximation model for these systems, it is critical to capture their time-varying behavior and strong nonlinearity. In this article, a multilayer online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine (ML-OSRKELM)-based online spatiotemporal modeling approach is developed for such DPSs. First, ML-OSRKELM stacks multiple online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine autoencoders (OSRKELM-AEs) to create a deep network, which can translate the spatiotemporal domain into a low-dimensional time domain. Then, an online sequential reduced kernel extreme learning machine (OS-RKELM) is employed to construct a dynamic temporal model. Finally, after obtaining time coefficients from the time domain, OS-RKELM is also used to reconstruct the original spatiotemporal domain. By using the kernel trick and the support vector selection strategy, the proposed method can remove redundant information while maintaining satisfactory nonlinear learning performance. Furthermore, the designed sequential update scheme can update the model parameters with real-time data, which makes it a promising method for capturing time-varying dynamics. Experiments and simulations on a lithium-ion battery's thermal process confirm the excellent performance and validity of the proposed model.

AB Faster region-based conventional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is a common algorithm for object detection that identifies the object and their location information through three steps: feature extraction, region proposal network and classification. However, there are data privacy issues in the training and prediction of Faster R-CNN. Thus we design a multi-party privacy-preserving Faster R-CNN framework for object detection named SPFR. Specifically, we extend the existing sub-protocols and achieve high-precision division, exponentiation and logarithm calculation through the idea of blinding and oblivious transfer (OT) protocols. Then we design a series of key privacy-preserving protocols that satisfy the secure computational requirements based on the above-mentioned sub-protocols and prove that these protocols are security in the semi-honest adversary model. Finally the proposed protocols are implemented in Pytorch, and the experimental findings demonstrate the efficiency of the protocols in Faster R-CNN.

AB Inmulti-view subspace clustering, it is significant to find a common latent space in which the multi-view data sets are located. A number of multi-view subspace clustering methods have been proposed to explore the common latent subspace and achieved promising performance. However, previousmulti-view subspace clustering algorithms seldom consider the multi-view consistency and multi-view diversity, let alone take them into consideration simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering by joint measuring the consistency and diversity, which is able to exploit these two complementary criteria seamlessly into a holistic design of clustering algorithms. The proposedmodel first searches a pure graph for each view by detecting the intrinsic consistent and diverse parts. A consensus graph is then obtained by fusing the multiple pure graphs. Moreover, the consensus graph is structurized to contain exactly c connected components where c is the number of clusters. In this way, the final clustering result can be obtained directly since each connected component precisely corresponds to an individual cluster. Extensive experimental studies on various datasets manifest that our model achieves comparable performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved outstanding performance for hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) image fusion. However, CNNs cannot explore the long-range dependence for HS and MS image fusion because of their local receptive fields. To overcome this limitation, a transformer is proposed to leverage the long-range dependence from the network inputs. Because of the ability of long-range modeling, the transformer overcomes the sole CNN on many tasks, whereas its use for HS and MS image fusion is still unexplored. In this article, we propose a spectral-spatial transformer (SST) to show the potentiality of transformers for HS and MS image fusion. We devise first two branches to extract spectral and spatial features in the HS and MS images by SST blocks, which can explore the spectral and spatial long-range dependence, respectively. Afterward, spectral and spatial features are fused feeding the result back to spectral and spatial branches for information interaction. Finally, the high-resolution (HR) HS image is reconstructed by dense links from all the fused features to make full use of them. The experimental analysis demonstrates the high performance of the proposed approach compared with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

   distribution learning (LDL); large margin; weighted kNN
AB Label distribution learning (LDL) helps solve label ambiguity and has found wide applications. However, it may suffer from the challenge of objective inconsistency when adopted to classification problems because the learning objective of LDL is inconsistent with that of classification. Some LDL algorithms have been proposed to solve this issue, but they presume that label distribution can be represented by the maximum entropy model, which may not hold in many real-world problems. In this article, we design two novel LDL methods based on the k-nearest neighbors (kNNs) approach without assuming any form of label distribution. First, we propose the large margin weighted kNN LDL (LW-kNNLDL). It learns a weight vector for the kNN algorithm to learn label distribution and implement a large mar-gin to address the objective inconsistency. Second, we put forward the large margin distance-weighted kNN LDL (LDkNN-LDL) that learns distance-dependent weight vectors to consider the difference in the neighborhoods of different instances. Theoretical results show that our methods can learn any general-form label distribution. Moreover, extensive experimental studies validate that our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art LDL approaches.

AB Recently, environmental concerns have drawn worldwide attention. As a result, the international communities have put pressure on both governments and industries to develop environmental conservation policies and green products, respectively. Also, the consumers' environmental awareness has increased to the point that today's consumers consider the greenness of the products in addition to the purchase price. In this study, we consider an industry consisting of two manufacturers that compete over selling price and carbon emissions, while the government levies a carbon emissions tax. We formulate the problem using a game-theoretic approach assuming the leader-follower relationship between the government and industry. The manufacturers maximize their profits, while the government maximizes three components: social welfare, environmental conservation, and revenues. We study the problem in two different settings: one in which the manufacturers have similar powers (Nash) and one in which one manufacturer is the leader in the market (Stackelberg). We find that superiority in production technology or a lower unit production cost does not necessarily lead to a lower selling price and that the outcome depends on the carbon emission tax rate. Based on a numerical experiment, government intervention reduces the total carbon emissions by more than almost half in both settings. We also found that an industry with Nash structure is preferred from the perspective of the consumers.

AB Cell counting and segmentation are critical tasks in biology and medicine. The traditional methods for cell counting are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. Recently, deep learning-based cell counting methods have become a trend, including point-based counting methods, such as cell detection and cell density prediction, and non-point-based counting, such as cell number regression prediction. However, the point-based counting method heavily relies on well-annotated datasets, which are scarce and difficult to obtain. On the other hand, nonpoint-based counting is less interpretable. The task of cell counting by dividing it into two subtasks is approached: cell number prediction and cell distribution prediction. To accomplish this, a deep learning network for spatial-based super-resolution reconstruction (SSRNet) is proposed that predicts the cell count and segments the cell distribution contour. To effectively train the model, an optimized multitask loss function (OM loss) is proposed that coordinates the training of multiple tasks. In SSRNet, a spatial-based super-resolution fast upsampling module (SSR-upsampling) is proposed for feature map enhancement and one-step upsampling, which can enlarge the deep feature map by 32 times without blurring and achieves fine-grained detail and fast processing. SSRNet uses an optimized encoder network. Compared with the classic U-Net, SSRNet's running memory read and write consumption is only 1/10 of that of U-Net, and the total number of multiply and add calculations is 1/20 of that of U-Net. Compared with the traditional sampling method, SSR-upsampling can complete the upsampling of the entire decoder stage at one time, reducing the complexity of the network and achieving better performance. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cell counting and segmentation tasks. The method achieves nonpoint-based counting, eliminating the need for exact position annotation of each cell in the image during training. As a result, it has demonstrated excellent performance on cell counting and segmentation tasks. The code is public on GitHub (https://github.com/Roin626/SSRnet).

AB Analog electronic and photonic crossbar arrays have been emerging as energy-efficient hardware implementations to accelerate computationally intensive general matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplications in machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the inevitable nonuniformity in large-scale electronic and optoelectronic devices and systems prevents scalable deployment. Herein, a calibration approach is reported that enables accurate calculations in crossbar arrays despite hardware imperfections. This approach is experimentally validated in a small-scale free-space photonic crossbar array based on cascaded spatial light modulators and demonstrated the scalability and universality of this approach in various large-scale electronic and photonic crossbar arrays. The improved performance of calibrated crossbar arrays in an ML model inference is further demonstrated to classify handwritten digital images.

AB Self-learning entropic population annealing (SLEPA) is a recently developed method used for achieving interpretable black-box optimization via density-of-states estimation. Applying SLEPA to a chemical space is not straightforward, however, because of its dependence on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in the space of generated entities. Herein, SLEPA is applied to optimal molecule generation by combining an irreducible Markov chain in the space of fragment multisets and a probabilistic fragment assembler such as MoLeR. The weighted samples from SLEPA are used to identify salient fragments for the highest occupied molecular orbitals-lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) gap maximization and minimization, and the relationship between the identified fragments and the electronic structures is elucidated. This approach offers a viable platform to reconcile the incompatible goals of optimization and interpretation during molecular design.

AB The advancement of future large-scale wireless networks necessitates the development of cost-effective and scalable security solutions. Specifically, physical layer (PHY) security has been put forth as a cost-effective alternative to cryptographic mechanisms that can circumvent the need for explicit key exchange between communication devices. Herein, a space-time-modulated digitally-coded metamaterial (MTM) leaky wave antenna (LWA) is proposed that can enable PHY security by achieving the functionalities of directional modulation (DM) using a machine learning-aided branch-and-bound (B & B) optimized coding sequence. Theoretically, it is first shown that the proposed space-time MTM antenna can achieve DM through both the spatial and spectral manipulation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal. Simulation results are then provided as proof-of-principle, demonstrating the applicability of the approach for achieving DM in various communication settings. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed architecture controlled by a field-programmable gate array is realized, which achieves DM via an optimized coding sequence carried out by the learning-aided B & B algorithm corresponding to the states of the MTM LWA's unit cells. Experimental results confirm the theory behind the space-time-modulated MTM LWA in achieving DM, which is observed via both the spectral harmonic patterns and bit error rate measurements.

TI AI and core electoral processes: Mapping the horizons

DT Article
ID POLLING PLACE; ELECTIONS; VOTE; CAMPAIGN
AB It is well documented that there has been significant enthusiasm across the globe in respect of using AI for all forms of social activity. However, the electoral process - the time, place, and manner of elections within democratic nations - is one of few sectors in which there has been limited penetration of AI. Electoral management bodies in many countries have recently started exploring and deliberating over the use of AI in the electoral process. In this paper, we consider five avenues within the core electoral process which have potential for AI usage, and map the challenges involved in using AI within them. These five avenues are: voter list maintenance, determining polling booth locations, polling booth protection processes, voter authentication, and video monitoring of elections. Within each avenue, we lay down the context, illustrate current or potential usage of AI, and discuss extant or potential ramifications of AI usage, as well as potential directions for mitigating risks when considering AI usage. We believe that the scant current usage of AI within electoral processes provides a very rare opportunity to deliberate on the risks and mitigation possibilities prior to actual and widespread AI deployment. This paper is an attempt to map the horizons of risks and opportunities in using AI within electoral processes and to help shape the debate around the topic.

AB Numerical weather prediction is an established weather forecasting technique in which equations describing wind, temperature, pressure and humidity are solved using the current atmospheric state as input. This study examines deep learning to forecast weather given historical data from two London-based locations. Two distinct Bi-LSTM recurrent neural network models were developed in the TensorFlow deep learning framework and trained to make predictions in the next 24 and 72 h, given the past 120 h. The first trained neural network predicted temperature at Kew Gardens with a forecast accuracy of +/- 2 degrees C in 73% of instances in a whole unseen year, and a root mean squared errors of 1.45 degrees C. The second network predicted 72-h air temperature and relative humidity at Heathrow with root mean squared errors 2.26 degrees C and 14% respectively and 80% of the temperature predictions were within +/- 3 degrees C while 80% of relative humidity predictions were within +/- 20%. Both networks were trained with five years of historical data, with cloud training times of over a minute (24-h network) and three minutes (72-h).

   Neighborhood aggregator
AB Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims at complementing missing entities and relations in a knowledge graph (KG). Popular KGC approaches based on KG embedding are typically limited to the transductive setting, i.e., all entities must be seen during training, which is impractical for real-world KGs where new entities are emerging daily. Recent inductive KG embedding approaches propose to train a neighborhood aggregator in conjunction with entity and relation embeddings, which helps to embed unseen entities via existing neighbors. However, existing methods do not fully take advantage of the structural information of neighbors and are unable to handle triplets involving unseen relations. In this paper, we work further and propose a novel and unified inductive KGC model, namely structure-aware attention network (SAAN), which can efficiently generate embeddings of unseen entities and relations by aggregating neighbors with structure-aware attention weights. Unlike conventional embedding-based attention methods, SAAN can naturally learn importance weights by modeling structural correlations between nodes in an embedding-independent manner and can be applied to any existing KG embedding model. Experimental results on both transductive and inductive KGC tasks show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB Machine vision is one of the main applications of artificial intelligence. In China, the machine vision industry makes up more than a third of the national AI market, and technologies like face recognition, object tracking and automated driving play a central role in surveillance systems and social governance projects relying on the large-scale collection and processing of sensor data. Like other novel articulations of technology and society, machine vision is defined, developed and explained by different actors through the work of imagination. In this article, we draw on the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries to understand how Chinese companies represent machine vision. Through a qualitative multimodal analysis of the corporate websites of leading industry players, we identify a cohesive sociotechnical imaginary of machine vision, and explain how four distinct visual registers contribute to its articulation. These four registers, which we call computational abstraction, human-machine coordination, smooth everyday, and dashboard realism, allow Chinese tech companies to articulate their global ambitions and competitiveness through narrow and opaque representations of machine vision technologies.

AB The structure of the hopping robot is such that the robot, relying on a single leg, must make consecutive jumps and be able to maintain its balance with hand tools. For this purpose, changing the angle of the robot's hands on the upper body is responsible for maintaining the robot's balance. If the upper body function is optimal, the leg mechanism can jump from the momentum caused by the robot mass. In this research, a semi-active mechanism is used for jumping, and the active actuator only performs the task of compensating for wasted energy. The new content of this research is based on the use of a simple four-link mechanism to compress the passive element rather than the ball-screw mechanism or any complete active mechanisms for jumping actions, and two moving arms to get balanced and do horizontal motion like acrobats by leading forward and changing orientation based on a unicycle model. Robot control method and how to implement PD controllers to move on a plane in a 3D space are presented; also, this paper presents the total modeling and motion control based on jump movement, balance, and robot orientation. The control concept of jumping is obtained as an open-loop multi-phases controller with no feedback from spatial position and orientation, just the internal joints of the robot, as well as the balancing control that used feedbacks of position and velocity states for observing different phases. Although, the rotating motion is a feedforward control. Finally, by implementing the control method and the robot model in a virtual environment (Simscape/Matlab), the robot's pursuit of some paths simulated. So the control motions act independently to guide the robot at a maximum speed of 3.1 cm per second. The simulations included the following online and offline trajectories, and the robot's performance is validated for movements in the range of 7-16 m per 260-600 s, as the robot is able to jump as high as 28 cm at the duration of 0.6 s in each stage hop.

AB This research is dedicated to investigating the dynamics identification and periodic control of a mono-wing aerial vehicle. The study employs well-established system identification strategies in both time and frequency domains to extract equivalent linear models. By exciting the system dynamics with a frequency sweep signal, non-parametric and parametric models are derived for each control channel, namely the flap and thrust. Furthermore, a comprehensive nonlinear simulation model is developed to facilitate trade study and design optimization. The identified models undergo careful validation using a two-square wave input signal, demonstrating their accuracy through a comparison with flight test data. Moreover, in terms of the control design, a noteworthy achievement is made by proposing a novel approach. The study showcases the effectiveness of a unique combination of multi-loop PID controllers specifically adapted to the time-periodic nature of the system. Remarkably, this approach enables satisfactory control behavior in a 3D environment utilizing only the flap input in the control loop while keeping the motor speed constant. Such a breakthrough holds great significance as it allows for the reliable application of a complex time-periodic aerial vehicle in demanding maneuvers, relying on just a single effective actuator.

AB Herein, deep learning (DL) is used to predict the structural parameters of Ag nanohole arrays (NAs) for spectrum-driving and color-driving plasmonic applications. A dataset of transmission spectra and structural parameters of NAs is generated using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations and is converted to vivid structural colors using the corresponding transmission spectrum. A bidirectional neural network is used to train the transmission spectrum and structural color together. The accuracy of predicting the structural parameters using a desired spectrum is tested and found to be up to 0.99, with a determination coefficient of reproducing the desired spectrum and color to be 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. These values are higher compared to those when only training for spectrum, but requiring less training time. This strategy is able to inverse design the NAs in less than 1 s to maximize surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement by matching transmission resonance and laser excitation wavelength, and accurately regenerate colored images in 7.5 s, allowing for nanoscale printing at a resolution of approximately 100 000 dots in(-1). This work has important implications for the efficient design of nanostructures for various plasmonic applications, such as plasmonic sensors, optical filters, metal-enhanced fluorescence, SERS, and super-resolution displays.

DE Adversarial learning; deep neural networks; dictionary learning; domain
   adaptation; traffic scene classification
AB In recent years, the accurate recognition of traffic scenes has played a key role in autonomous vehicle operations. However, most works in this area do not address the domain shift issue where the classification performance is degraded when the distribution of the source and target images are different due to weather changes. Also, lack of sparsity of current studies results in sample complexity and overfitting issues. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Adversarial Domain Adaptation (SADA) model for traffic scene classification. Our objective is to learn a scene classifier on a source domain with sunny weather and transfer its knowledge to a target domain with different weather (i.e., cloudy, rainy, and snowy) to enhance the classification performance on the target. First, a sparse representation is learned from the source traffic scenes via nonlinear dictionary learning in the latent space of a deep classifier. Then, a conditional generative adversarial network is devised to capture the distribution of the source sparse codes. Finally, a domain invariant sparse feature extractor is developed via a minimax game to align the sparse codes of the target domain images with the source; hence, providing domain adaptation for traffic scene classification using a deep neural network. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected by the Honda Research Institute (HRI) indicate the superior performance of the proposed SADA compared to current traffic scene classification methods and state-of-the-art domain adaptation frameworks.

TI Foreground Fusion-Based Liquefied Natural Gas Leak Detection Framework

AB A leak detection and repair survey (LDAR) is essential to ensure a reliable and safe liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply. Modern LDAR systems deploy numerous fixed thermal imaging devices to automatically monitor the risk of potential leaks empowered by computational intelligence frameworks. Existing frameworks employ either background subtraction-based (BGS-based) or deep neural network-based (DNN-based) frameworks for LNG leak detection from thermal images. However, the BGS-based frameworks feature high sensitivity to perceive LNG emissions with low precision. On the contrary, the DNN-based frameworks can precisely classify the LNG leak after training while the sensitivity is low. Additionally, conventional DNN-based frameworks are difficult in modeling non-rigid objects such as LNG gas due to limited perceptive fields. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid framework, namely foreground fusion-based gas detection (FFBGD), combining the advantages of BGS-based and DNN-based detectors for improved detection robustness through newly introduced concept of information fusion to LNG industries. Specifically, a foreground fusion network (FFN) is designed to fuse information of original thermal and foreground images after BGS based on the visual attention mechanism. Meanwhile, several advanced modules, i.e. deformable convolution, feature pyramid network, and cascade region-of-interest (ROI) head are adopted to enhance leak detection by offering better perceptive fields. Extensive experiments are carried out in this study to demonstrate the significant improvement brought by the proposed FFBGD over leak detection accuracy and robustness. Hence, the proposed solution can be deployed in energy facilities and enable reliable visual surveillance of LNG leaks.

AB Deep neural networks have been applied to different applications, such as image recognition, data analysis, natural language processing, and so on. Some companies regularly release their mobile applications to app stores. Usually, app stores have a restriction that overweight applications can not be downloaded until the smartphone connects to Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, the size of the application that consists of deep neural networks may be too large. In order to reduce the size of application, an efficient compression approach is highly desired. An efficient encoding for compressed neural networks is a critical point for reducing storage complexity. Most of previous studies focus on the sparse matrix encoding instead of the dense one. The dense matrix encoding methods have not been studied well. Meanwhile, sparse matrix encoding can not attain a high compression rate when encoding a dense matrix. Toward this end, we proposed an alternative compression algorithm that linearizes the weights on each layer and then stores linearized weights with critical information. For a dense matrix, our algorithm can achieve a higher compression rate than one existing sparse matrix encoding. Experiment results indicate that our proposed piecewise linearization scheme can make VGG-16, Resnet152, and Densenet169 achieve at least two times of the compression rates. In other words, neural networks parameters can be stored in 40-50% of the original space.

TI DenseGCN: A multi-level and multi-temporal graph convolutional network
   for action recognition
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE data analysis; pattern recognition
AB With the exponential growth of video data, action recognition has become an increasingly important area of study. Despite various advancements, achieving a balance between detection accuracy and lightness remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the complexity of existing action recognition models. To address this issue, DenseGCN is developed, a lightweight network designed to optimize accuracy and efficiency. The aim was to create a detection model that has high accuracy while remaining lightweight for real-world applications. DenseGCN operates via a unique three-level feature fusion system. The initial stage involves the Multi-level Fusion Network (MlFN), which contains dense connections and a Spatial-Temporal Fusion Attention module (STF-Att), designed to eliminate bias in feature extraction caused by deep networks. In the next stage, RefineBone tackles optimization issues in low-dimensional feature layers by leveraging high-dimensional feature layers, thus avoiding gradient stacking. Finally, the Multi-temporal Fusion Feature Pyramid Network (MF-FPN) generates a discriminative classification feature map by repetitively combining data from multiple dimensions. This strategy has proven successful in refining the extracted feature, allowing for discriminative feature extraction even with a reduced number of channels. This efficient design not only contributes to further research in developing lightweight networks but also offers enhanced possibilities for real-world implementations. In two large-scale datasets, NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, DenseGCN outperformed other state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy of 92.7% on the X-View benchmark of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset. The DenseGCN is 10.2 x faster and 10 x smaller than the spatial temporal graph attention network (STGAT) proposed in 2022 while retaining very competitive accuracy. The findings suggest that this model significantly improves the quality of feature extraction. As a result, DenseGCN presents a remarkable balance between accuracy and lightness.

AB Digital marketing technology can not only help enterprises effectively control marketing costs but also accurately identify target customers and determine customer needs to improve marketing conversion rates. Multiple conflicting and asymmetric criteria need to be taken simultaneously into account to effectively assess digital marketing technology. Accordingly, the target of our paper is to propound an enhanced additive ratio assessment (ARAS) methodology to aid experts in evaluating digital marketing technology in a complex uncertain setting. The spherical fuzzy (SF) set is an expansion of the picture fuzzy set (PFS) that has been recognized as a powerful model to portray indeterminacy and vagueness. A fresh score function is proffered to compare the SF numbers and its merits are also analyzed. Then, some novel operations for SF numbers are defined and several aggregation operators based on them are propounded. Further, a mixed multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method is developed by incorporating the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC), step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA), and enhanced ARAS approach under SF information. Also, a case concerning digital marketing technology evaluation is executed to prove the efficiency and practicability of the presented SF-MEREC-SWARA-ARAS method. Finally, contrast and sensitivity investigations are also implemented to highlight the strengths and robustness of the proffered methodology, respectively.

AB Autoclave is the most important equipment in the composite curing process, and its real-time condition has a direct impact on the quality of composite materials. Therefore, rapid and precise fault diagnosis reasoning is of great significance for the autoclave. To address the shortage of signed directed graph (SDG)-based fault diagnosis method, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on digital twin (DT) enhanced SDG for autoclave. Firstly, the SDG model of autoclave temperature control system is constructed, and the model is improved and enhanced by pre-fault transition state identification, fuzzy confirmation of node states, and simplification of potential branch circuits by using DT. The effectiveness of the method in this paper is verified by fault diagnosis based on SDG and DT-SDG methods respectively. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the speed and resolution of fault diagnosis by reducing the number of potential fault propagation paths and the number of inferences.

AB In this paper, we present a decentralized sparse Gaussian process regression (DSGPR) model with event-triggered, adaptive inducing points. We address common issues inherent in decentralized frameworks such as high computation costs, inter-agent message bandwidth restrictions, and data fusion integrity. We also improve real-time sparse Gaussian process regression models by introducing an adaptation of the mean shift and fixed-width clustering algorithms called radial clustering. Radial clustering enables real-time SGPR models to have an adaptive number of inducing points through an efficient inducing point selection process. The entire DSGPR framework is evaluated on multiple simulated random vector fields. The results show that this framework effectively estimates vector fields using multiple autonomous agents. We also show the practical use of these algorithms by testing them on hardware typical for small autonomous vehicles

AB Autonomous maneuvering flight is essential for civil applications of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Yet it remains a challenge due to the coupled translational and rotational dynamics and the complexity of the movements. This paper proposes a brain-inspired architecture for autonomous maneuvering flight of miniature UAVs. In designing such system, several key issues will be addressed: maneuver controller design, online maneuver decision making, and command generation. First, a modeling method based on dual quaternion is proposed to describe maneuvering flight. Then, an incremental flight control method in 6-DOF is introduced. Furthermore, a novel dual quaternion-based dynamic maneuvering primitive(DQ-DMP) is proposed to learn the trajectories performed by human pilots. Finally, a decision-making method based on a spiking neural network and Actor-Critic network is provided for the choice of maneuvering primitives. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation and outdoor flight test show that the architecture can learn, repeat and generalize the maneuvers. Various aerobatic maneuvers can be performed by the fixed-wing UAV after several demonstrations.

AB The aviation use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) necessitates a strong control design. The key to designing a durable control system is a well-developed flight dynamics model. System-based model identification techniques provide a useful means for estimating UAV modal parameters thereby saving time and money. Although considerable research is performed on UAV flight dynamics analysis utilizing system identification techniques, limited work exists that compares various techniques of system identification for UAVs in an exhaustive manner. Moreover, the research contributions toward performance evaluation and comparison of system identification methods outputs are even more scarce, especially under varying environmental conditions. In this study, a comprehensive framework utilizing various linear and nonlinear estimation techniques estimates unknown UAV model dynamics. To analyze the effects of varying flight conditions, a detailed analysis is performed which includes a parametric sweep of environmental elements as input arguments to the estimation process. The comparison involves the estimation of key performance parameters such as residual analysis, final prediction error, and fit percentages. Through rigorous analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework predicts system parameters under a variety of conditions, thereby confirming its validity. It has also been demonstrated that a parametric sweep of environmental conditions, can be utilized to improve the authenticity of models' data learning ranges, and their response to the prediction parameters. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, provides an elaborate platform for researchers to carry out comprehensive model prediction under a wide range of environmental conditions.

ID ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; APPROXIMATION
AB This paper presents a strong data-mining method based on a rough set, which can simultaneously realize feature selection, classification, and knowledge representation. Although a rough set, a popular method for feature selection, has good interpretability, it is not sufficiently efficient and accurate to deal with large-scale datasets with high dimensions, which prevents it from being immediately applied to real-world scenarios. To address the efficiency issue of a rough set, we discover the stability of the local redundancy (SLR) of attributes and propose a theorem to prove it rigorously. Based on SLR, only the parts of objects in the boundary region are partitioned when calculating outer significance, which further improves the efficiency of the rough set. With regard to the accuracy issue, we show that overfitting may lead to ineffectiveness of the rough set, especially when processing noise attributes. We then propose relative importance, a robust measurement for an attribute, to alleviate such overfitting issues. In this paper, we propose a novel rough-set framework that significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of existing rough-set methods. We further develop our rough set framework by proposing a "rough concept tree" for knowledge representation and classification. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that our proposed framework achieves higher accuracy than seven state-of-the-art feature-selection methods. All the codes are available at https://github.com/syxiaa/powerroughset.

AB Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) have proven effective in quickly finding feasible solutions to complex motion planning problems. RRT* is an extension of the RRT algorithm that provides probabilistic asymptotic optimality guarantees when using straight-line motion primitives. This work provides extensions to RRT and RRT* that employ fillets as motion primitives, allowing path curvature constraints to be considered when planning. Two fillets are developed, an arc-based fillet that uses circular arcs to generate paths that respect maximum curvature constraints and a spline-based fillet that uses Bezier curves to additionally respect curvature continuity requirements. Planning with these fillets is shown to far exceed the performance of RRT* using Dubin's path motion primitives, approaching the performance of planning with straight-line path primitives. Path sampling heuristics are also introduced to accelerate convergence for nonholonomic motion planning. Comparisons to established RRT* approaches are made using the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL).

AB Traditional solvers for tackling combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are usually designed by human experts. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in utilizing deep learning, especially deep reinforcement learning, to automatically learn effective solvers for CO. The resultant new paradigm is termed neural combinatorial optimization (NCO). However, the advantages and disadvantages of NCO relative to other approaches have not been empirically or theoretically well studied. This work presents a comprehensive comparative study of NCO solvers and alternative solvers. Specifically, taking the traveling salesman problem as the testbed problem, the performance of the solvers is assessed in five aspects, i.e., effectiveness, efficiency, stability, scalability, and generalization ability. Our results show that the solvers learned by NCO approaches, in general, still fall short of traditional solvers in nearly all these aspects. A potential benefit of NCO solvers would be their superior time and energy efficiency for small-size problem instances when sufficient training instances are available. Hopefully, this work would help with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of NCO and provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol for further benchmarking NCO approaches in comparison to other approaches.

AB For deep learning, size is power. Massive neural nets trained on broad data for a spectrum of tasks are at the forefront of artificial intelligence. These large pre-trained models or "Jacks of All Trades" (JATs), when fine-tuned for downstream tasks, are gaining importance in driving deep learning advancements. However, environments with tight resource constraints, changing objectives and intentions, or varied task requirements, could limit the real-world utility of a singular JAT. Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building increasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into concepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning model sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, the Set of Sets is formulated to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental conditions. A means to arrive at such a set tractably in one pass of a neuroevolutionary multitasking algorithm is presented for the first time, bringing us closer to models that are collectively "Masters of All Trades".

AB The complex network has attracted increasing attention and shown effectiveness in modeling multifarious systems. Focusing on selecting members with good spreading ability, the influence maximization problem is of great significance in network-based information diffusion tasks. Plenty of attention has been paid to simulating the diffusion process and choosing influential seeds. However, errors and attacks typically threaten the normal function of networked systems, and few studies have considered the influence maximization problem under structural failures. Therefore, a quantitative measure with a changeable parameter is first developed in this paper to tackle the unpredictable destruction percentage on networks. Further, limitations on the existing methods are shown experimentally. To address these limitations, the evolutionary multitasking paradigm is employed, and several problem-specific operators are developed. On top of these developments, a multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm is devised to find seeds with robust influence ability, termed MFEARIM, where the genetic information for both myopia and holistic areas is considered to improve the search ability. Additionally, an asynchronous strategy is designed to efficiently tackle tasks with distinct costs, and the convergence of the search process can thus be accelerated. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world networks validate the competitive performance of MFEARIM over the existing methods.

However, the field-of-view is restricted by the input size. To overcome the problem, a multi-magnification attention convolutional neural network (MMA-CNN) is proposed to analyze images based on both local and global features. Our approach focuses on identifying the importance of individual features at each magnification level and is applied to pathology whole slide images (WSIs) segmentation to show its effectiveness. Several interactive figures are also developed to enhance the reader's understanding of our research.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION
AB Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is an evolutionary algorithm that adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy to solve large-scale optimization problems. It is difficult for CC to specify a suitable subpopulation size to solve different subproblems. The population diversity may be insufficient to search for the global optimum during subpopulations' evolution. In this paper, an adaptive method for enhancing population diversity is embedded in a contribution-based CC. In CC, there are two kinds of subpopulation: the convergent or stagnant subpopulations and the non-convergent and non-stagnant subpopulations. A method is proposed in the paper to evaluate the convergent and stagnant subpopulations' contributions to improving the best overall objective value, which is different from the contribution evaluation on the non-convergent and non-stagnant subpopulations. In each co-evolutionary cycle, the new CC adaptively determines to select a subpopulation, which can make a greater contribution to improving the best overall objective value, between the above two kinds of subpopulation to undergo evolution. When a convergent or stagnant subpopulation is selected to undergo evolution, the subpopulation is re-diversified to enhance its global search capability. Our experimental results and analysis suggest that the new CC algorithm can improve the performance of CC and serves as a competitive solver for large-scale optimization problems.

AB Recently, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown promising performance in terms of community detection in complex networks. However, most studies have focused on designing different strategies to achieve good community detection performance based on a single population. Unlike these studies, this study proposes a macro-micro population-based co-evolutionary multi-objective algorithm called MMCoMO for community detection in complex networks to obtain a better trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This algorithm employs two populations, i.e., macro-population and micro-population, for co-evolution to obtain better community structures. In particular, the macro-population prefers exploration and is responsible for quickly determining approximate partitions of the network to obtain good rough community structures as early as possible, whereas the micro-population favors exploitation and is responsible for searching for good fine community structures through the local search process. Thus, these two populations can be used to improve each other through interactions in the co-evolutionary process. In particular, a guiding strategy is designed using the elite (non-dominated) solutions of the macro-population to guide the micro-population, and an influencing strategy is further designed using the elite solutions of the micro-population to positively influence the macro-population. Experiments on synthetic networks and 14 real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

AB This paper presents a modular autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform called the Multi-robot System (MRS) Drone that can be used in a large range of indoor and outdoor applications. The MRS Drone features unique modularity changes in actuators, frames, and sensory configuration. As the name suggests, the platform is specially tailored for deployment within a MRS group. The MRS Drone contributes to the state-of-the-art of UAV platforms by allowing smooth real-world deployment of multiple aerial robots, as well as by outperforming other platforms with its modularity. For real-world multi-robot deployment in various applications, the platform is easy to both assemble and modify. Moreover, it is accompanied by a realistic simulator to enable safe pre-flight testing and a smooth transition to complex real-world experiments. In this manuscript, we present mechanical and electrical designs, software architecture, and technical specifications to build a fully autonomous multi UAV system. Finally, we demonstrate the full capabilities and the unique modularity of the MRS Drone in various real-world applications that required a diverse range of platform configurations.

AB This paper presents a novel framework for a robust motion control scheme of an eight-thruster underwater vehicle. It combines a model-free approach intertwined with a model-based approach such as sliding mode control (SMC) to counter the unknown disturbances and decouple them to provide better tracking. A proportional-integral (PI) control-like structure is taken as the first sliding surface. A proportional derivative (PD) control-like structure is proposed as the second sliding surface for trajectory tracking. This motion control works for any fully actuated or over-actuated vehicle. Initially, the dynamic model and vehicle configuration are presented. Then the vehicle's closed-loop behavior is studied in the presence of underwater currents. Later, the study considers external disturbances and compensates them with the help of a nonlinear disturbance observer. Lyapunov's direct method and Barbalat's lemma ensure the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors. The proposed controller performance is evaluated using a detailed comparison study with different model-free and model-based controllers from the literature. Later, the control scheme's effectiveness is demonstrated numerically with the help of computer-based simulations. The robustness against the parameter uncertainties, underwater currents, and unknown disturbances is also presented.

AB The vertical stable walking problem of the rock hole inspection robot is a difficult and key point in design and control, which solves the important problem of the robot being able to walk vertically. In this paper, a rock hole inspection robot is designed, which can inspect the pore morphology and rock cracks in rock holes by carrying cameras, test sensors and other monitors. It can adapt to the inspection function of rock holes at an angle of 0-90 & DEG; with a diameter of 95 mm-105 mm. ADAMS software is used to carry out dynamic simulation analysis of the robot, and the reasonable design of the pre-tightening reducing mechanism is obtained. At the same time, the important influence of the pre-tightening pressure between the walking wheel and the hole wall and the spring pre-tightening force on the robot's traction force is obtained. On this basis, the problem of vertical walking is emphatically solved, so that the robot can walk at any angle within the 90 & DEG; range rock hole, thus expanding the application scope of the robot. Based on the theoretical analysis, a robot experimental platform is built to verify the key technologies of the robot and test the performance of the robot, including visual acoustic signal acquisition, moving speed test and traction force test, which proved the correctness of theoretical analysis and design.

AB Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV are vehicles capable of take-off and landing vertically like helicopters while maintaining the long-range efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. Unfortunately, due to their wing area, these vehicles are sensitive to wind gusts when hovering. One way to increase the hovering wind-rejection capabilities of hybrid UAV is through the addition of extra actuators capable of directing the thrust of the rotors. Nevertheless, the ability to control UAVs with many actuators is strictly related to how well the Control Allocation problem is solved. Generally, to reduce the problem complexity, conventional (CA) methods make use of linearized control effectiveness in order to optimize the inputs that achieve a certain control objective. We show that this simplification can lead to oscillations if it is applied to thrust vectoring vehicles, with pronounced non-linear actuator effectiveness. When large control objectives are requested or actuators saturate, the linearized effectiveness based CA methods tend to compute a solution far away from the initial actuator state, invalidating the linearization. A potential solution could be to impose limits on the solution domain of the linearized CA algorithm. However, this solution only reduces the oscillations at the expense of a lag in the vehicle acceleration response. To overcome this limitation, we present a fully nonlinear CA method, which uses an Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm to solve the CA problem. The method is tested and implemented on a single board computer that computes the actuator solution in real time onboard a dual axis tilting rotor quad-plane. Flight test experiments confirm the problem of severe oscillations in the linearized effectiveness CA algorithms and show how the only algorithm able to optimally solve the CA problem is the presented Nonlinear method.

AB To successfully perform autonomous navigation, mobile agents must solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. However, acquiring the map in a single SLAM session may not be possible, thus the map may be incrementally built over multiple sessions. Two solutions could be considered to solve the multisession SLAM problem: (i) the robot must localize itself in the previously stored map before the new session starts; (ii) it can start a new map and merge it with the map from the previous sessions. To date, only scenario (i) has been addressed by RatSLAM, an algorithm inspired by the navigation system in rodent brains. Therefore, this work proposes a multisession solution that solves both scenarios. A new mechanism merges the data from the RatSLAM structures of the current mapping session with those previously stored if there are connections between these paths. This approach was tested in four different scenarios, from virtual controlled environments to real-world environments with two, three, and five sessions. The robot started in an unfamiliar location for each mapping session, but it also works if the agent starts in a known place, scenario (ii) and (i), respectively. For all experiments, the entire map was consistently obtained. Furthermore, the proposed approach updates and enhances the previous session's map in real-world environments. Therefore, the proposed approach may be a multiple SLAM session solution for the RatSLAM algorithm.

AB In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has spread across different fields of the industry due to their ease of deployment and minimal operational risk. Firefighting is a dangerous task for the humans involved, in which the use of UAVs presents itself as a good first-action protocol for a rapid response to an incipient fire because of their safety and speed of action. Current research is mainly focused on wildland fires, but fires in urban environments are barely mentioned in the bibliography. To motivate the research on this topic, ICUAS'22 organized an international competition inspired by this mission, with the challenge of a UAV traversing an area populated by obstacles, finding a target, and precisely throwing a ball to it.

AB Solving the inverse kinematics of redundant and hyper-redundant manipulators is more challenging because their kinematic redundancy leads to a more complicated mapping from end-effector pose to configuration space. A heuristic inverse kinematics solver, called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK), has been demonstrated to solve the inverse kinematics of complex chain systems with fast convergence and simple implementation. However, as the pose precision of the end-effector increases to a higher value, such as 10(-6), FABRIK converges slowly in some configurations and thus exhibits unstable convergence behavior. Hence, this paper presents a novel inverse kinematics algorithm that combines FABRIK and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm, in which the joint angles deduced by FABRIK will be taken as the initial seed of the SQP algorithm to realize fast convergence. Meanwhile, a universal and non-trivial mapping from joint Cartesian positions to joint angles is included to enable the extension of FABRIK to redundant and hyper-redundant manipulators while retaining its simplicity. With the 10(-6) pose error constraint, quantitative tests on serial chain manipulators demonstrate that the combined algorithm outperforms FABRIK in terms of success rate and runtime. Meanwhile, some popular inverse kinematics algorithms are treated as benchmarks to compare with the combined algorithm. Finally, simulations using serial chain manipulators indicate the effectiveness of the combined algorithm on path tracking.

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB Deep neural network has shown a powerful performance in the medical image analysis of a variety of diseases. However, a number of studies over the past few years have demonstrated that these deep learning systems can be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks, with minor disruptions added to the input. Since both the public and academia have focused on deep learning in the health information economy, these adversarial attacks would prove more important and raise security concerns. In this article, adversarial attacks on deep learning systems in medicine are analyzed from two different points of view: 1) white box and 2) black box. A fast adversarial sample generation method, Feature Space-Restricted Attention Attack is proposed to explore more confusing adversarial samples. It is based on a generative adversarial network with bound classification space to generate perturbations to achieve attacks. Meanwhile, it can employ an attention mechanism to focus this perturbation on the lesion region. This enables the perturbation closely associated with the classification information making the attack more efficient and invisible. The performance and specificity of the proposed attack method are demonstrated by conducting extensive experiments on three different types of medical images. Finally, it is expected that this work can assist practitioners become being of current weaknesses in the deployment of deep learning systems in clinical settings. And, it further investigates domain-specific features of medical deep learning systems to enhance model generalization and resistance to attacks.

AB In this study, the event-triggered problem of networked control systems (NCSs) is investigated, and a novel information transmission scheme is established. Under this scheme, the segment-weighted information (SWI) in a sliding historical window (SHW) is calculated and then sampled. Compared with the traditional direct sampling method, in this approach, the control input includes historical information in the SHW, thereby leading to less information loss due to sampling. This study also emphasizes on designing an SWI-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) for scheduling network transmission. Different from most of the existing ETMs, the proposed SWI-based ETM leverages historical information to determine which data are necessary for the whole control system. Our approach can greatly reduce the number of unexpected triggering events of a control system with stochastic disturbances owing to the introduction of the SWI in the ETM. Moreover, Zeno phenomena are prevented thanks to periodic sampling. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the Lyapunov functional approach, and a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This article investigates the event-triggered synchronization control problem of discrete-time neural networks (DNNs) in the case of periodic sampled-data. A discrete-time periodic event-triggered mechanism is adopted to evaluate the measurements, which avoids formulating the triggering function in a continuous manner and saves energy consumption. Under this framework, an event-triggered dynamic output-feedback controller is designed to achieve the goal of synchronization. A piecewise Lyapunov functional is constructed to analyze the sawtooth-like pattern of sampled-error signals. Thereafter, the synchronization criteria are formulated for the considered DNNs. The co-designed issue is further discussed for the control gains and triggering parameter. Finally, a simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper introduces the concept of bi-interior hyperideals, a combi-nation of bi-hyperideals and interior hyperideals in hypersemigroups. We examine that bi-interior hyperideals generalize other hyperideals, especially bi-hyperideals and interior hyperideals. The intersection and union of bi-interior hyperideals are discussed. Further-more, we provide the generating sets of bi-interior hyperideals. Finally, we apply the notion of bi-interior hyperideals to classifying regular and intra-regular hypersemigroups.

DE Rush repair spare parts; Demand forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy

AB Rush repair spare parts of power equipment are necessary for ensuring the normal operation of the critical equipment of power grid. Once the power equipment is damaged due to disasters and the rush repair spare parts are out of stock, the reper-cussions of the accident will be worsened, causing further harm to the power grid and potentially large losses to production and life. On the other hand, the excessive inventory of rush repair spare parts will cause a waste of cost. Therefore, accurate prediction of rush repair spare parts demand is very important. It is particularly difficult to forecast the demand for rush repair spare parts of power equipment due to the nature of their demand, which is usually highly uncertain, random, and with a small amount of historic data. Aiming to improve the scientificity and practicality, this paper proposes a demand forecasting method of rush repair spare parts by using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clus-tering and the Fuzzy Decision Tree (FDT). At first, we analyze the characteristics of emergency events causing spare parts demand and the attributes of spare parts' demand data. Secondly, FCM is applied to dividing the historic demand data into clusters. Then, FDT is used to mine the correlation between the spare parts demand and the emergency events and forecast the demand for rush repair spare parts according to the best cluster of data, and thus realize to predict the demand even with a small data set. Finally, we verify the proposed method by a data set of emergency demand for rush repair spare parts during the last three years from a power company.

AB The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) has to bypass flight due to the com-plex distribution of obstacles in the urban environment. This paper proposes the TPA (tangent point algorithm) used in optimal path planning which can enable UAV to effec-tively avoid obstacles and achieve optimal flight metrics. Firstly, the environment model is established and the obstacles are reconstructed as two-dimensional circles. And the finite path is traversed and the optimal path is selected. Secondly, the UAV kinematic model is established to optimize the UAV flight mode and determine the flight strategy according to the adjacent obstacle circle. Thirdly, the UAV energy consumption model is established based on the energy transfer process and multi-stage optimal path. Finally, the simulation method is used to compare the optimal paths of TPA, A (A-Star), PRM (probabilistic road map), and RRT (rapidly-exploring random tree). TPA has the short-est calculation time and the collision-free optimal path. And the optimal power is chosen to ensure the bi-objective optimization of the flight time and energy consumption. The structural parameters of the UAV and the obstacle information are integrated to deter-mine the optimal flight strategy of the UAV on the optimal path.

TI SELF-WEIGHTED DEEP SUBSPACE CLUSTERING WITH FUZZY LABELS

AB . In weakly-supervised learning, the background knowledge of applications could be given in the form of fuzzy labels, where experts are not sure about the exact class annotations for all data objects (e.g., images), but they can provide candidate labels for a subset of the objects. Subspace clustering aims to segment data objects into different clusters, each of which is related to a subspace. In this study, we propose a novel self-weighted deep subspace clustering algorithm, named DSCF, to learn the subspaces of datasets provided with a small number of fuzzy labels. In the proposed loss function, we consider the local relationship of data objects to reconstruct the input data and design the constraints on the self-weighted similarity of objects to embed the fuzzy labels. The self-expression matrix for final spectral clustering is learned by minimizing the loss function to jointly optimize the reconstruction error and the comprehensive constraints. The experiment results show that the proposed DSCF outperforms the compared algorithms on five gray-scale image datasets. Further experiments on the cardinality of fuzzy labels are conducted and the effectiveness of fuzzy label simulation is discussed.

DE Stunting detection; Deep learning; Health sciences; Computer sciences
AB . Stunting is a complicated problem to solve. The impact of stunting is on the long-term development of children where they may never reach their full high potential and have poor cognitive development which leads to less than optimal educational performance and decreased intellectual capacity, motor, and socioeconomic development. In the case of Indonesia, WHO includes Indonesia in countries with a high risk of stunting (30%-39%). This study aims to predict the risk of stunting using a semi-supervised learning model. However, it is necessary to explore the dominant determinants of stunting first. Unsupervised learning is superior for finding attributes that have a high correlation, while supervised learning is used to map attributes that correlate with stunting risk targets. Stunting data is recorded in each community health center for each district. There are some public health centers names such as "KAPAN", "PANTJE", "KUANFATU", "OEEKAM", and "OIMLASI". We found that the community health centers "KAPAN" and "PANTJE" form a stunting prevalence cluster with the highest values at 50% and above. "KUANFATU", "OEEKAM", and "OIMLASI" followed at 30% to 50%.

DE Masked face recognition; Face recognition; Without retraining; Data
   aug-mentation
AB With the recent global pandemic event, the requirement to use masks, espe-cially in public spaces, has become a challenge to the existing face recognition system. To overcome this challenge, previous studies have performed transfer learning and finetuning of the existing model with masked face datasets. Others have performed a preprocessing by cropping the masked face and then fine-tuning the model with the newly cropped datasets. However, retraining with preprocessed or masked faces may be costly or even unavailable for some with limited resources. Furthermore, these methods of preprocessing are ill-advised to be used directly using models that are not retrained as was found in this study. Therefore, this study explores and presents a way of cropping which shows increases in performance without the requirement of any training to the existing face recognition model. This method managed to increase the performance of the existing model by up to 9.09% when presented with masked-face scenarios.

DE Image denoising; Block -matching; Sparsity; Bi-hard thresholding
ID SCALE
AB The primary purpose of image denoising is to remove noise while better maintaining important detail information in the image. Block-matching and 3D flite-ing (BM3D) is a state-of-the-art image denoising method. However, the intense isolated noise in the high-level noise situations is difficult to be removed due to the unique co-efficient hard-thresholding in the original BM3D method. In this paper, we propose an improved BM3D algorithm using bi-hard thresholding, i.e., coefficient hard-thresholding and structural hard thresholding. The whole procedure consists of two significant steps: essential estimation and final estimation, and each step is divided into three minor steps: block-matching, collaborative filtering, and aggregation. In the basic estimation stage, we further enhance the sparsity of the transformed coefficients by reducing the coefficient hard-thresholding and adding structural hard-thresholding on the third dimension instead of the unique coefficient hard-thresholding in the original BM3D method. Finally, we compare the improved algorithm with the original BM3D method on the public dataset in high-level noise situations. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the denoising performance.

AB In steel companies, the energy cost is one of the main costs of steel products, and it provides new targets for companies to consider the internal consumption and con-version of energy and reduce production costs. As one of the three key processes in steel production, steelmaking and continuous casting process plays an important role in energy optimization. In this paper, taking account of the impact of tiered electricity prices and converting gas to electricity, we developed a new model for steelmaking and continuous casting with the above energy constraints to reduce the production of slab costs. For the case of unknown casting sequence in advance, coexistence of continuous and discrete pro-duction process, a novel two-stage process bat algorithm is developed. In this algorithm, the casting sequence on the continuous casting machine is determined first, followed by the heating sequence on the converter and refining furnace. By solving the practical scheduling problem, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution for the different objectives quickly. In conclusion, the improved two-stage process bat algorithm is effective, and the scheduling model with gas and electricity constraints can reduce enterprise costs and increase its profits.

AB BI (Business Intelligence), as a part of information technology, has been a unique medium for users to interact with data that were commonly used to make strategic business decisions; unfortunately, most business intelligence dashboards out there have a lack of usability for users that were not experts in the related field. Practical obser-vation of this problem led to an exploration of how HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) practices could be used to solve the user experience and usability problems that existed within the business intelligence scope. There have been researches regarding the benefit of human-centered approaches used to solve multiple user experience problems in other fields; however, only a little research exists on how human-centered approaches could be used in the BI development process. This study shows how a human-centered approach, specifically design thinking, could be used to improve dashboard usability by embedding the five-stage process inside the "BI Application Track" of the Kimball lifecycle. This research has a valuable contribution that has been evaluated thoroughly to deliver better business intelligence dashboard usability; the results show a higher usability score mea-sured with SUS (System Usability Scale); and lower time on task spent by the users while performing test prompts.

AB Cardiovascular diseases are serious threats to human health. Electrocardio-gram (ECG) is of great significance for clinical diagnosis and follow-up treatment of arrhythmias. However, the ECG signal is inevitably contaminated by a large amount of noise during ECG acquisition and transmission, which affects the results of arrhythmia detection. Noise reduction was often applied before classification in previous studies, which may cause the loss of some heart beats. Therefore, the preprocessing of noise reduc-tion is omitted and noisy signals are directly classified in this paper. A novel deep learning model, deep shrinkage network, is developed in this paper to improve feature extraction ability and arrhythmia detection accuracy of noisy ECG recordings. Soft thresholding is introduced into deep fully convolutional neural network (DFCNN) to eliminate noise. ECG spectrograms are used as the input of the proposed network, and the Focal Loss function is employed to solve the problem of data imbalance. By training the original da-ta from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, an overall accuracy of 99.74% is achieved. Significant advantages are also shown in the detection task of noisy ECG signals with different SNRs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed network.

Utilizing the dy-namic surface method, the desired control law is designed. The developed control mech-anism ensures that all closed-loop system trajectories are semi-globally uniformly and ultimately bounded. A nonlinear dynamical system of the HESM is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the technique. The simulation results indicate that the method can maintain speed even in the presence of a sudden load torque. It is capable of rapidly reducing oscillations and outperforming the existing nonlinear controller such as the backstepping controller.

AB When the virtual synchronous machine control strategy has large capacity load switching, the frequency will exceed the limit which will affect the safe operation of the system. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-agent distributed frequency modulation control strategy based on reinforcement learning, which detects the frequency deviation of the micro-grid system, defines the local reward and global reward, designs the distributed information interaction process, calculates the control quantity of the secondary frequency modulation of each controller by using Q learning, overcomes the deficiency of centralized frequency modulation, and makes the coordinated output of distributed generators asymptotically eliminate the frequency deviation. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and this control strategy ensures the safe and stable operation of microgrid.

ID MOTION CONTROL; SYSTEMS; NETWORK
AB A new control strategy based on neural network backstepping and a pre-scribed performance function is proposed for speed control in the permanent magnet lin-ear synchronous motor (PMLSM) systems. First, the prescribed performance function is introduced to transform the control error and improve the dynamic and static perfor-mance of the system. This limits the error tracking of the original system to prescribed bounds if the transformed system is stable. Then, the disturbance observer is designed with radial basis function neural network and introduced into the controller as compensa-tion signal. Considering the differential expansion problem in the backstepping control, the output of the controller is filtered by the command filter. This filtered output is then used in feed forward compensation, further improving system performance. Finally, the control scheme is verified by a motor experiment platform. According to the experimental results, it is proved that the control strategy can improve the robustness of the system and the ability to suppress disturbances.

AB Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has spread rapidly around the world, posing a huge challenge to public health. Computed tomogra-phy (CT) has played an extremely important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The automatic segmentation of infected areas in CT images using computer-aided diagnosis techniques is of great significance for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This paper proposes a novel segmentation deep network, ESR-Net, for segmenting COVID-19 infected regions in chest CT images. In ESR-Net, a pre-trained ResNet is used to enhance the feature ex-tracting process. Then edge attention helps improve the boundary of infected region, side output filter and reverse attention work together aimed to improve the detail performance in the segmentation results. Our method is tested on a dataset which contains 1939 chest CT slices. Among them, 1551 CT volumes are used for training and 388 CT volumes are used for testing. The results show ESR-Net achieving 83.1% Dice coefficient, 83.8% sensitivity, and 84.3% F-measure, outperforms other existing methods.

AB In the warehousing procedure of fresh agricultural products in the rural cold chain warehouses, preliminary preservation is typically achieved through sorting, grad-ing, and packaging in the sorting procedure. The allocation decision of sorting resources is crucial and complicated in the sorting procedure, as it not only reduces the loss of fresh agricultural products after harvesting but also facilitates operation cost savings in subse-quent transportation procedures. Inappropriate resource allocation can result in excessive sorting time and a failure to process new sorting orders arriving randomly. Moreover, the excessive sorting time often leads to the decline of the quality of fresh agricultural products, which causes significant losses to both cold chain enterprises and rural farm-ers. This paper constructs a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-type Sorting Resources Collaborative Allocation (MARLS-MSRCA) to make the collaborative allocation of sorting resources in rural cold chain warehouses. In the MARLS-MSRCA, a collaborative interaction mechanism of sorting resource agents is proposed based on the analysis of the sorting procedure and the sorting resources involved. This mechanism obtains the strategy of collaborative allocation of multi-type sorting resources through the interactive learning between agents and the continuous interaction between agents and the sorting environment. Finally, the numerical experiments verified that the average order completion time and sorting cost in the rural cold chain warehouses can be great-ly reduced by the proposed MARLS-MSRCA, which also demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively promote the collaboration of the sorting procedure in rural cold chain warehouses.

DE Facial expression recognition; Multi-attention mechanism;

AB . This paper suggests a facial expression recognition network based on a multiattention mechanism called SCSNet to address factors like pose change and occlusion in facial expression recognition while also taking account of the issue of inadequate facial information extraction using a single attention mechanism (Spatial-attention, Channelattention, and Self-attention Network). The network is put together by the multi-attention mechanism using channel, spatial, and Self-attention. In comparison to using a single attention mechanism, the network concentrates on more useful expression traits when channel attention and spatial attention are combined. The Self-attention technique can reduce ambiguous annotation-related elements including illumination, occlusion, human position changes, and others, which enhances the model's capacity for discriminative expression. This study used the RAF-DB public dataset for the experimental evaluation, which had an accuracy of 86.89%. The outcomes of the experiments on different datasets further demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.

AB . Spatial-temporal data prediction of taxi demand is a challenging task because of complicated spatial dependencies and dynamical trends of temporal pattern between different regions. However, limited representations of given spatial graph structure with incomplete adjacent connections may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependencies learning of model. This study proposes a taxi demand prediction model that combines node2vec algorithm with a graph attention network and Markov cluster algorithm with convolution operation to capture spatial dependency and adopts Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to obtain temporal correlation. The core of model proposed in this paper is to construct spatial block. First, we propose a novel method for constructing traffic graph based on Markov cluster algorithm, and name semantic correlation graph. Then, considering complexity of traffic data, we employ graph attention layer with mask graph operation and use modified convolutional operation to obtain deep spatial dependency. taxi dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently compared with other baselines.

DT Article
DE Frequency; High voltage generation; Insulator; Insulator testing;
   Solid-state; Tesla transformer; Test transformer
AB Tesla transformers are parts or devices that generate a voltage from a high -frequency, damped oscillating wave that uses resonance to move energy from the primary to the secondary. The working principle of the Tesla transformer utilizes the principle of electromagnetic induction resonance from a series of capacitors and inductors that resonate at high frequencies. Tesla transformers can be used in insulation testing. Insu-lators play an essential role in the operation of the electrical system, so their performance needs to be considered. Testing the insulator using a Tesla transformer has the advantage that it is cheap and does not require a large area. Insulator testing is done by varying the distance, type of electrode and frequency of the test voltage. Testing the insulator is due to the distribution of the electric field at the electrodes, which will affect the breakdown voltage. The test results of the Tesla transformer have a better comparison value when compared to the test transformer. This test module is expected to help find out whether the Tesla transformer circuit based on solid-state components can be used as an alterna-tive to high-voltage testing by comparing the test transformer test.

AB Industry 4.0 standards have been widely adopted by most industries, encompassing remote monitoring for workplace safety, logistics, asset monitoring, quality management, and product monitoring. Real-time data, including images, must be transmitted for effective remote monitoring. However, due to cybersecurity concerns, the data must be encrypted before being sent over the internet. To address this, a real-time smart camera-based encryption method using chaos is proposed in this work. The encryption logic is created using LabVIEW and integrated into the smart camera. The four-step encryption process includes pixel shuffling, confusion, Improved logistic mapping, and diffusion. Encryption keys are generated using the user's passcode to set the initial parameters of the logistic mapping for generating key sequences. The resulting encrypted frames are diffused with index key streams to further enhance security. The proposed method has undergone security and performance analyses, demonstrating robustness against various vulnerabilities and minimal computational time. This makes it suitable for real-time encryption scenarios in Industry 4.0.

DE Multiagent systems; Distributed reinforcement learning; Game theory;
   Fully cooperative Markov games; Independent learners
AB In this article, we introduce the Smooth Q-Learning algorithm for independent learners (distributed and non-communicative learners) in cooperative Markov games. Smooth Q-Learning aimed to solve the relative over-generalization and the stochasticity problems while also performing well in the presence of other non-coordination factors such as the miscoordination problem (also known as the Pareto selection problem) and the non-stationarity problem. Smooth Q-Learning is an algorithm that tries to find a trade-off between two incompatible learning approaches: the maximum-based learning and the average-based learning, by dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on the value of temporal difference error in a way that ensures the algorithm lies somewhere between average-based learning and maximum-based learning. We compare Smooth Q-Learning against different algorithms from the literature: Decentralized Q-learning, Distributed Q-Learning, Hysteretic Q-Learning, and a recent version of Lenient Q-Learning called Lenient Multiagent Reinforcement learning 2. The results show that Smooth Q-Learning is very effective in the sense that it has the highest number of convergent trials. Unlike competing algorithms, Smooth Q-Learning is also easy to tune and does not require storing additional information.

AB . The tracking performance of a phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithm in gridconnected power electronic systems significantly contributes to the success of grid synchronization. This paper presents an efficient software realization of SOGI-PLL (second order generalized integrator - phase locked loop), as one of the most popular single-phase grid synchronization strategies in practice. The utilization of floating-point processors has been relatively common; however in this work, the SOGI-PLL is implemented using the fixed-point arithmetic technique in consideration of delivering a low-cost and compact hardware solution. Fixed-point microcontrollers or DSPs are still widely used by many researchers, developers, and practical engineers due to their cost-efficient implementation in both hardware and development software tools. In this work, the implementation of the SOGI-PLL algorithm in fixed-point arithmetic is demonstrated using C programming in a low-cost 16-bit fixed-point DSC dsPIC30F3014 with a 20 MHz crystal clock. Based on the implementation results, the developed SOGI-PLL algorithm can accurately estimate the grid's fundamental voltage parameters such as the voltage magnitude, phase angle, and frequency.

AB . This paper investigates the stability problem for nominal and uncertain Lur'e systems with time-varying delays. By applying the Lyapunov theory, the paper proposes an improved absolute stability criterion and a robustly absolute stability criterion, respectively. For one thing, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with delay-dependent matrices and four single integral items is constructed. It can make full use of the system state variables and time delay information. For the other, to overcome the problem of nonlinear inequalities caused by the augmented LKF, the stability criteria can be expressed as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) via the new negative definite inequalities equivalence transformation lemma application. Finally, some case studies based on the uncertain Lur'e systems and Chua's circuit showed the effectiveness of the presented criteria.

AB . The sophistication of the Internet provides fast and easy information transfer. When passing through an open channel, keeping information confidential becomes important to be well received. Therefore, a robust information confidentiality mechanism is needed. Combining cryptography and steganography provides a robust confidentiality mechanism. Parallel Encryption with Digit Arithmetic of Covertext (PDAC) is a multilevel information security model that combines cryptography and steganography. The PDAC's covertext is a part that affects the strength of confidential information. This study aims to improve the resilience of the PDAC encryption model using a fuzzy logic approach in the covertext generation section. Entropy, and time consumption are used as performance metrics. The experiment's result shows an increasing entropy up to 6.31 with an achievement value of 78.85%, and an average consumption time of 15.674 seconds.

AB This paper is devoted to the problem of a decentralized controller design for linear large-scale system (LSS) continuous time uncertain polytopic system, for the case when the system output variables are functions of all system states, i.e., the system output matrix is not in the form of a decentralized structure. The original decentralized controller design procedure on the subsystem level is introduced where the interaction (either the strong or the weak) between subsystems does not play any role. Such design procedure will take place in three steps. In the first step of decentralized controller de-sign, the LSS model is transformed to a decentralized structure. In the second step, robust stability boundary of the complex transformed system is calculated. Based on the results obtained, the method of robust decentralized controller design is selected, which accepts the obtained above stability boundary. This procedure will allow more precise and better implementation of the third step of the robust decentralized controller design. The whole robust decentralized controller design process will be performed on the subsystem level, without taking account of any interactions between the subsystems. Finally, the effective-ness of the proposed method is documented using an example with three scenarios and three subsystems.

AB Secret sharing can protect the security of important secret information in the network environment. However, the computational complexity and processing delay increase drastically when the secret information contains large amounts of data, such as three-dimensional (3D) data cubes. To improve the efficiency of secret sharing on 3D data cubes, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the generation of shares and reconstruction of the secret. The proposed hardware architecture parallelizes the secret sharing process and optimizes on this basis to save large amounts of circuit resources. Simulation results show that this architecture performs secret sharing more than ten times faster than the software implementation. This study enables the secret sharing of 3D data cubes, which protect large amounts of data information throughout the process and allows complete reconstruction of 3D data cubes. To be able to handle secrets without decoding them, we then extend the hardware architecture to the four basic processes of multi-party computation, demonstrating the feasibility of the structure and providing preliminary research tools for the effective implementation of multi-party computation.

AB In recent years, the scarcity of effective communication systems has been an essential issue for disabled people [physically disabled, locomotor disability, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)] who cannot speak, walk, or move their hands. The lives of disabled people depend on others for survival, so they need assistive technology to live independently. This research paper aims to develop an efficient real-time eye-gaze communication system using a low-cost webcam for disabled persons. This proposed work developed a Video-Oculography (VOG) based system under natural head movements using a 5-point user-specific calibration (algorithmic calibration) approach for eye-tracking and cursor movement. During calibration, some parameters are calculated and used to control the computer with the eyes. Additionally, we designed a graphical user interface (GUI) to examine the performance and fulfill the basic daily needs of disabled individuals. The proposed method enables disabled persons to operate a computer by moving and blinking their eyes, similar to a typical computer user. The overall cost of the developed system is low (Cost < $50, varies based on camera usage) compared to the cost of various existing systems. The proposed system is tested with disabled and non-disabled individuals and has achieved an average blinking accuracy of 97.66%. The designed system has attained an average typing speed of 15 and 20 characters per minute for disabled and non-disabled participants, respectively. On average, the system has achieved a visual angle accuracy of 2.2 degrees for disabled participants and 0.8 degrees for non-disabled participants. The experiment's outcomes demonstrate that the developed system is robust and accurate.

AB When processing the detection of boats in aerial images by neural networks, we have always been concerned about the execution time of these networks in the equipment on board the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Throughout its mission, the UAV will capture images that must be processed in real time. For this purpose, a network optimized for execution time is essential. This article proposes an enhanced Network Architecture Search (NAS) method for searching for time-optimized detection networks, for a given dataset, using an evolutionary algorithm. The search uses mutations as a mechanism of evolution that affect the structure of the network and the hyper-parameters of its layers. Its original fitness function allows the choice of architectures that are not very greedy in terms of operations, specifically favouring small networks whose advantages are to be fast and quick to train, thus accelerating the search algorithm. Using this method, we were able to obtain detection networks with an improved mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to the initial network (parent) but with much fewer FLoating-point OPerations (Flops): 68% of operations reduction. This induces considerable gain in terms of execution time with 50 Frames Processed per Second (FPS) in an embedded environment on a drone.

AB Digital photos are deemed an important source of information. The global request for lucid images has upsurged in the last decade. Accordingly, increasing the quality of images can be made through different features. Among such, color is a crucial feature as it gives an image a pleasing look and holds key significant information. As known, digital images are obtained with degradations, and deficient colors are an effect that can be observed in different types of images obtained by various modern imaging systems. Improving the colors while preserving the other important image features and details is needed for various real-world uses. Hence, an expeditious tint intensification (TI) algorithm that can boost the colors is introduced in this research, in that it begins by converting the image to the HSV domain and preserving the hue channel while processing the other two channels of saturation and value using different concepts. The image is then converted to the RGB domain and processed again using several methods to produce the desired output. Different experiments on real-world images have been made, comparisons with various algorithms are also attained and the results have been assessed using three dedicated image evaluation metrics. Promising results have been obtained, in that the TI algorithm is proven to deliver visually pleasing results, in that the colors appear vivid, the contrast is adequate, and the brightness is preserved with no visible filtering flaws. This is imperative because a few computations have been used to produce high-quality results in a fast and efficient way. The outcomes of this study are significant as they can be utilized in different important research areas.

AB Breast cancer is commonly recognized as the second most frequent malignancy in women worldwide. Breast cancer therapy includes surgical surgery, radiation therapy, and medication which can be exceedingly successful, with 90% or higher survival rates, especially when the condition is discovered early. This work is one such approach for early detection of breast cancer relying on the BI-RADS score. In this regard, a computer-aided-diagnosis system based on a bespoke Digital Mammogram Diagnostic Convolutional Neural Network (DMD-CNN) model that can aid in the categorization of mammogram breast lesions is proposed. Furthermore, a PYNQ-based acceleration through the Artix 7 FPGA is employed for deployment of DMD-CNN model's hardware acceleration platform which is the first of its kind for breast cancer, yielding a performance accuracy of 98.2%, the proposed model exceeded the state-of-the-art approach. The comparative analysis performed in the study has shown that the proposed method has resulted in a 4% increase in accuracy and a good recognition rate of 96% when compared to the existing model. A k-fold cross-validation (k = 5, 7, 9 the reported accuracy score values are 96.2%, 97.5% and 98.1%, respectively) approach was used to test and assess the integrated system. Extensive testing using mammography datasets was carried out to determine the increased performance of the suggested approach. Experiments reveal that when compared to the DMD-CNN model acceleration to GPU, the suggested solution not only optimizes resource utilization but also decreases power consumption to 3.12 W. Hardware acceleration through FPGA resulted in processing and analyzing nearly 91 images in a second where a single image will be processed using CPU.

DE Surface defect detection; MobileNet; YOLOv4; Transfer learning;
   Depthwise separable convolution
AB In this paper, we propose a lightweight and fast detection framework called Mixed YOLOv4-LITE series based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) for industrial defect detection. To reduce the size of the model and achieve a better balance between accuracy and speed, MobileNet series (MobileNetv1, MobileNetv2, MobileNetv3) and depthwise separable convolutions are employed in the modified network architecture to replace the backbone network CSPdarknet53 and traditional convolution in the neck and head of YOLOv4, respectively. Additionally, we combine the Mosic data enhancement method to enrich the dataset. To accelerate the convergence of the network, transfer learning is used in the training stage, in which pseudo-convergence is precluded as much as possible by adjusting the learning rate of the cosine annealing scheduler. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both public defect datasets, NEU-DET and PCB-DET, with different types and scales. On NEU-DET, Mixed YOLOv4-LITEv1 achieved an improvement of 214% in detection speed while maintaining accuracy, detecting at a rate of 88 FPS on a single GPU. Meanwhile, Mixed YOLOv4-LITEv1 realizes an outstanding maximum improvement of 200% in detection speed while only losing a mean average precision (mAP) value of 1.77% on PCB-DET. Furthermore, the sizes of our proposed series models are only about one-fifth of the original YOLOv4 model. The extensive test results indicate that our work can provide an efficient scheme with low deployment cost for surface defect detection at different scales in multiple scenarios, meeting the needs of practical industrial applications.

TI U-DPnet: an ultralight convolutional neural network for the detection of

DE Apple detection; Lightweight network; DP structure; Localization
AB Efficient and accurate detection of apples is critical for the successful implementation of harvesting robots in orchards. However, due to limited memory resources on robotic platforms, it is imperative to develop lightweight detection algorithms that can operate in real-time. To address this challenge, we propose an ultralight convolutional neural network, U-DPnet, based on depth-separable convolution. Our approach incorporates the cross-stage deep separable module (CDM) and the multi-cascade deep separable module (MDM) in the backbone for nonlinear unit addition and attention mechanisms, which reduce the volume of the network while improving the feature representation capability. A simplified bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) is constructed in the neck for multi-scale feature fusion, and Adaptive feature propagation (AFP) is designed between the neck and the backbone for smooth feature transitions across different scales. To further reduce the network volume, we develop a uniform channel downsampling and network weight-sharing strategy. Multiple loss functions and label assignment strategies are used to optimize the training process. The performance of U-DPnet is verified on a homemade Apple dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that U-DPnet achieves detection accuracy and speed comparable to that of the 7 SOTA models. Moreover, U-DPnet exhibits an absolute advantage in model volume and computations (only 1.067M Params and 0.563G FLOPs, 39.79% and 36.36% less than yolov5-n).

AB FPGAs have emerged as a promising platform for implementing neural networks due to their reconfigurability, parallelism, and low power consumption. Nonetheless, designing and optimizing FPGA-based neural network accelerators is a complex and time-consuming task with register transfer level (RTL) languages. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools provide a higher level of abstraction for FPGA design, enabling designers to concentrate on top-level design aspects, such as algorithms, rather than low-level hardware implementation details. One of the state-of-the-art object detection networks is you look only once (YOLO) network series which is constructed using different neural network technologies using cross-stage connections and feature extraction techniques like pyramid networks. In this paper, we propose a method for the implementation of YOLOv7-tiny network on FPGAs using HLS tools. We present a comprehensive analysis of the performance and resource utilization of FPGA-based neural network accelerators. Our methods show excellent results for real-time application requirements such as latency. Specifically, our work reduces the usage of digital signal processing (DSP) units by 90% and it saves up to 60% of flip-flops compared to state-of-the-art designs, while achieving competitive usage of block RAM and look-up tables. Additionally, the achieved design latency of 15 ms is extremely suitable for real-time applications. Also we will propose a method for BRAM utilization method and off-chip memory access.

AB This study investigates the adoption of blockchain technology in small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) supply chains. Blockchain has been deemed a "Game Changer"for its potential benefits but also has several limitations due to its properties and SMEs' limited resources. Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) have more problems employing Industry 4.0 Technologies in practice than larger companies. So, the employment of BC in SMEs' supply chains, as the economy's backbone, deserves a full investigation which has been addressed in this paper. We use the Technology-Organization-Environment framework to examine both positive and negative factors affecting blockchain adoption in SMEs. A Delphi method was used to refine a list of 42 factors down to the 22 most essential ones. These factors were then prioritized using the Fuzzy Logarithmic Additive Weights Methodology based on expert preferences. The findings indicate that while financial factors play a crucial role in adoption, transparency, and traceability are significant benefits that motivate organizations to adopt blockchain. The organizational dimension also has a substantial impact on decision-making. In this study, we conclude that SMEs must carefully consider their circumstances before adopting blockchain technology, given its infancy state. The barriers to adoption are just as significant as incentives, and SMEs must weigh the financial and organizational factors before making the decision. This study extends the literature by comprehensively looking at all possible factors influencing BC adoption by SMEs. Furthermore, we have highlighted valuable insights for policymakers and SME owners to make the best decision.

DE Context information fusion; Colonoscopy; Polyp segmentation; Image-level

ID COLONOSCOPY
AB More than 95% of colorectal cancers are gradually transformed from polyps, so regular colonoscopy polyp examination plays an important role in cancer prevention and early treatment. However, automatic polyp segmentation remains a challenging task due to the low-contrast tissue environment and the small size and variety (e.g., shape, color, texture) of polyps. In this case, the rich context information in colonoscopy images is worth exploring to address the above issues. On the one hand, the image-level context with a global receptive field can be used to enhance the discrimination between the foreground and the background to alleviate the occult and indistinguishability of polyps in colonoscopy images. On the other hand, the surrounding-level context focused on the surrounding pathological region of the polyp has more detailed features that are beneficial for polyp segmentation. Therefore, we propose a novel network named ISCNet that aims to fuse image-level and surrounding-level context information for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce the Global-Guided Context Aggregation (GGCA) module to explicitly model the foreground and background of polyp segmentation through image-level context, thereby flexibly enhancing polyp-related features and suppressing background-related features. Then, we design the Diverse Surrounding Context Focus (DSCF) module to focus on the surrounding area of the polyp to extract diverse local contexts to refine the segmentation results. Finally, we fuse the feature maps derived from these two modules so that our ISCNet can enjoy the facilitation of both the image-level and surrounding-level context information. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on three challenging datasets. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results confirm that our ISCNet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/vvmedical/ISCNet.

ID VIDEO FIRE
AB Early fire and smoke detection with computer vision have attracted much attention in recent years, and a lot of fire detectors based on deep neural network have been proposed to improve the detection accuracy. However, most current fire detectors still suffer from low detection accuracy caused by the multi-scale variation of the fire and smoke, or the high false accept rate due to the fire-like or smoke-like objects within the background. In this paper, to address the above challenges, we propose an effective real-time fire detection network (AERNet) with two key functional modules, which achieves a good tradeoff between the detection accuracy and speed. First, we employ a lightweight backbone network Squeeze and Excitation-GhostNet (SE-GhostNet) to extract features, which can make it easier to distinguish the fire and smoke from the background and reduce the model parameters greatly. Second, a Multi-Scale Detection module is constructed to selectively emphasize the contribution of different features by channel and space. Finally, we adopt the decoupled head to predict the classes and locations of fire or smoke respectively. In the experiment, we propose a more challenging dataset "Smoke and Fire-dataset" ("SF-dataset") to evaluate the proposed algorithm, which includes 18,217 images. And the results show that the proposed method outperforms most SOTA methods in detection accuracy, model size, and detection speed.

AB Ore particle size information is a crucial indicator to evaluate the crushing quality and judge whether there are oversized ores on the conveyor belt. Accurately separating each ore is a critical prerequisite for obtaining high-precision particle size measurement (PSM) results. However, the large size variance and natural adhesion between ores pose a huge challenge to this task, imposing under-segmentation. Hence, this study proposes an automatic method that combines semantic segmentation and morphological operations to measure the ore particle size. Specifically, a novel multi-scale connection and boundary-aware U-Net model (MSBA-Unet) that classifies boundary pixels between adhesive ores more accurately is developed to segment ore images. Second, the convex-hull defect detection (CDD) method that divides the adhesive ores with a deep concave shape into two pieces is adopted to process the predicted masks further. The experimental results demonstrate that the MSBA-Unet architecture design and the CDD method can significantly improve the performance of separating adhesive ores of different sizes. Therefore, the under-segmentation problem is tremendously alleviated, and the ore PSM results agree well with the ground truth.

ID TWITTER
AB Social media platforms, such as Twitter, can be used to extract information related to traffic events. Previous works focused mainly on classifying tweets into predefined categories (i.e., traffic or non-traffic) without many details of traffic events. However, extracting traffic-related fine-grained information from tweets is essential to build an intelligent transportation system. In this work, we address for the first time the problem of detecting traffic events using Twitter as two subtasks: (i) identifying whether a tweet is traffic-related or not as a text classification subtask, and (ii) extracting more fine-grained information (i.e., "what", "when", "where", and the "consequence"of the traffic event) as a slot filling subtask. We also publish two Dutch Traffic Twitter datasets from Belgium and the Brussels capital region. We propose using deep learning based methods that process the two subtasks separately or jointly. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architectures achieve high performance scores (i.e., more than 95% F1 score) on the constructed datasets for both subtasks, even in a transfer learning scenario. In addition, incorporating tweet-level information in each of the tokens comprising the tweet (for the BERT-based model) can lead to a performance improvement for the joint setting. Our datasets and code are available on GitHub.1

DE Lightweight; Multi-target detection; RFB; YOLOv4; Attention mechanism
AB The complexity and diversity of complex scenes make multi-target detection a great challenge. Traditional target detectors based on deep learning suffer from extreme computational complexity, excessive memory consumption and poor real-time performance. We propose a lightweight multi-target detection model named L-YOLOv4. First, we choose the lightweight backbone network MobileNeXt instead of CSPDarknet53 to build up the efficiency of feature extraction and reduce the model complexity. Then we introduce an modified Receive Field Block smaller, which uses asymmetric cavity convolution and SE module to enhance the network feature extraction ability and increase the receptive field. Finally, we propose a DSC-ECA module consisting of a depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and an efficient channel attention (ECA) to replace standard convolutions. It diminishes the model parameters significantly and compensates for the accuracy loss. Experimental results show that L-YOLOv4 achieves 74.85% on the PASCAL VOC07+12 dataset and 25.28% on the MS COCO dataset. Under the premise of ensuring detection accuracy, L-YOLOv4 reduces 77.23% of the parameters and the computational cost is only 16% of that of YOLOv4. Its detection speed is 45.2 frames per second (FPS) on 3060Ti, which enables lightweight and real-time detection of the model.

AB This paper presents a parallel implementation of a fixed-point algorithm for wrapped phase denoising. The model based on total variation efficiently estimates discontinuous phase maps and further incorporates the Pythagorean trigonometric identity between the real and imaginary parts of the phase map, enhancing the quality of the restored phase. In this work, two parallel C/C++ implementations of the sequential version of algorithms were developed. The implementations include execution in a multi-core CPU and a GPU using OpenMP and CUDA, respectively. We show performance comparisons of the parallel implementations with advanced methods using synthetic and experimental data. Results show that our parallel implementations achieve speedups over the serial implementation of 12x for multi-core CPU and 110x for GPU.

ID DEFECT DETECTION
AB Fabric surface flaw inspection is essential for textile quality control, and it is demanding to replace human inspectors with the automatic machine vision-based flaw inspection system. To alleviate the time-consuming problem of sparse coding in detecting phase, this work presents a real-time fabric flaw inspection method by using grouped sparse dictionary. Firstly, the overcomplete sparse dictionary is learned from normal fabric images; secondly, the learned sparse dictionary is grouped into several sub-dictionaries by evaluating reconstruction error. Finally, the grouped dictionary is used to represent image and identify flaw regions as they cannot be represented well, leading to large reconstruction error. In addition, a non-maximum suppression algorithm is also proposed to reduce false inspection further. Experiments on various fabric flaws and real-time implementation on the proposed vision-based hardware system are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed method. In comparison with other dictionary learning methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the running time significantly and achieve a decent performance, which is capable of meeting the real-time inspection requirement without compromising inspection accuracy.

AB A lane detection algorithm based on lane shape prediction with transformers (LSTR) is designed to address the problems of a large number of feature extraction network parameters, low utilization of original feature information, and easy loss of detail and edge information in the current lane detection algorithm. First, to reduce the number of parameters in the lane detection network and achieve a lightweight design, the ordinary convolution is replaced by ghost convolution (Ghost-Conv) with good performance; second, to enhance the utilization of the original feature information in the network and improve the lane detection accuracy, a self batch normalization (Self-BN) module is proposed to retain more original feature information by changing the normalization to achieve the improvement of the lane detection accuracy, and finally, to improve the accuracy of the network for lane detection, an efficient channel attention (ECA) mechanism is introduced to enhance the extraction effect of lane detail information and edge information. Experiments are conducted on the open source dataset TuSimple, and the results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of parameters and computation by nearly half, improves the detection speed by 33 FPS, increases the detection accuracy by 0.96%, reaches 97.11%, and reduces the false positive rate and the false negative rate by 0.55% and 0.71%, respectively, meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous driving, compared to the original network. Compared to other lane detection networks, it also has great advantages.

AB The High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard has high compression efficiency. This efficiency is achieved at the expense of increasing the computational complexity. The HEVC encoder has the hierarchical search for optimal Coding Unit (CU) partitioning. It is based on rate-distortion optimization. Various solutions are proposed to reduce the encoding time. But, the machine learning-based methods have more effective in reducing the encoding time. Yet, deep learning tools have a relatively high computational load. So, in this paper a new low complexity convolutional neural network has been designed. It is called Convolutional Neural Network-based CTU Partitioner (CNNCP). It reduces the computational complexity of the HEVC encoding. The CNNCP takes the CTU luminance component and the quantization parameter (QP) as inputs, and provides the CU depth matrix in output at once. The CNNCP does not follow the hierarchical approach. Thus, it has a fixed computation structure that facilitates the use of parallel processing tools. The CNNCP has a simple structure with a least number of parameters, and thus, it has the least computational complexity. It has been trained and tested with a large database for all QP values. The results show that it reduced the encoding time by more than 90%, and makes it suitable for real-time applications.

AB As an important requirement, human-friendly motion in human-robot interaction (HRI) is increasingly attracting attention. In many scenarios, the ability to generalize a similar motion from demonstration is essential for a robot, and the similarity is generally captured by the spatial relationship between the different joints of the robot. Though a lot of investigation for motion generalization has been conducted and good progress achieved, they share limitations in leaving the relationship out of consideration and being difficult to apply the generalization between different robots. In this paper, we propose a novel topology-based motion generalization (TMG) method that abstracts the motion generalization problem to a mesh deformation optimization, and the spatial relationship between different parts of the robot is captured with a topology-based representation. Instead of only taking into account a single joint position, the relationship semantic with Laplacian coordinates is modeled, and the motion generalization from demonstration to reproduction is realized by preserving the semantic as a Laplacian deformation, and even the robot or target position is changed. Furthermore, motion generalization between single or multiple different robots can be achieved with spatial relationship preservation and transfer. Our experimental results show that the reproduction based on topology-based representation outperforms the mapping methods by training with end-effector pose or joint angles, and ensures robust motion with spatial relationship preservation.

   detection
AB Efficient face detectors with low computational cost and fast speed are still a pressing problem despite the significant progress made in uncontrolled face detection. To address this issue, we propose two lightweight face detectors for CPU device, named speed-priority face detector (SPFD) and accuracy-priority face detector (APFD). In the case of SPFD, we propose a simplified version of FaceBoxes by reducing convolutional layers and channel number for reducing model complexity and computational cost, as well as replacing max pooling layers with group convolutional layers to learn local information and features' integration. Additionally, large kernel attention modules based on prior knowledge of face size and network architecture are applied to increase the expression ability of features and capture the key information from long distances. Finally, an iterative retrained method is designed to further enhance the accuracy without increasing any cost during model testing. Regarding APFD, a new anchor generation strategy is utilized to find out more faces based on SPFD. Extensive experiments conducted on WIDER FACE validation dataset indicate that our detectors exceed FaceBoxes comprehensively in terms of accuracy and speed. Specifically, SPFD outperforms FaceBoxes by 4.1%, 8.6%, and 9.6% on WIDEFACE validation dataset while achieving the fastest detection speed on CPU device for VGA-resolution images. The average speed can reach 45FPS on CPU devices, while the size of its parameters is only 0.66 times of FaceBoxes. Moreover, the APFD outperforms many famous and lightweight face detectors and attains superior accuracy (easy: 91.4%, medium:88.1%, and hard: 64.7%) with 20FPS; it achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and speed for face detection.

ID INTRA-REFRESH
AB The high level of compression achieved by high efficiency video coding (HEVC) helps reduce network traffic loads and mitigate data rate requirements. However, HEVC is vulnerable to error-prone channels where transmission errors can result in severe degradation of video quality. In this paper, a saliency-aware encoding scheme is proposed to improve the error robustness of HEVC streaming, by reducing temporal error propagation in case of packet loss. The proposed scheme firstly introduces a saliency detection model in compressed domain, based on two HEVC features derived from the depth splitting of the coding unit and the residual. Incorporated with the saliency map, an improved reference frame selection strategy is then introduced to reduce the inter-prediction mismatch that occurs at the decoder after packet loss. Specifically, the reference frames are dynamically selected based on the saliency-weighted Lagrangian optimisation, which not only reduces the number of prediction units (PUs) that depend on a single reference in saliency regions but also chooses the optimal coding mode for non-saliency regions. Finally, the most salient PUs are required to select the reference block in which most of the pixels are coded with intra-mode, for providing more robust reference to saliency regions. The simulation results show that the proposed reference picture selection scheme outperforms other reference methods with higher error robustness and a smaller loss in coding efficiency. Compared to the HEVC reference software, the proposed scheme is able to improve the quality of recovered video after packet loss, achieving average PSNR gains of up to 1.92 dB.

AB For target detection tasks in complicated backgrounds, a deep learning-based radar target detection method is suggested to address the problems of a high false alarm rate and the difficulties of achieving high-performance detection by conventional methods. Considering the issues of large parameter count and memory occupation of the deep learning-based target detection models, a lightweight target detection method based on improved YOLOv4-tiny is proposed. The technique applies depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and bottleneck architecture (BA) to the YOLOv4-tiny network. Moreover, it introduces the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the improved feature fusion network. It allows the network to be lightweight while ensuring detection accuracy. We choose a certain number of pulses from the pulse-compressed radar data for clutter suppression and Doppler processing to obtain range-Doppler (R-D) images. Experiments are run on the R-D two-dimensional echo images, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately detect dim radar targets against complicated backgrounds. Compared with other algorithms, our approach is more balanced regarding detection accuracy, model size, and detection speed.

AB New and interesting uses for portable devices include the creation and viewing of 3D models and 360-degree photos of real landscapes. To provide a 3D model and a 360-degree view of a scenario, these apps search for real-time rendering and presentation. This study examines the impact of real-time image processing on movements in camera view and the application of optical flow algorithms. The optical flows are affected by how the objects involved motion. The way the image is recorded and the camera movements affect the relative motion. As a consequence, camera motions are responsive to optical flow algorithms. To record an image, the camera may pan around, move in a straight path, or move randomly. We have captured datasets of videos produced in different contexts to better replicate real-world scenarios. Each dataset was captured in a variety of illumination situations, camera movements, and indoor and outdoor recording sites. Here, to determine the most effective optical flow algorithms for use in near real-time applications, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, we compare results based on quality and processing delay for each video frame. We conducted a comparison study to better understand how random camera motion affects real-time video processing. These methods can be used to handle a variety of real-world issues, such as object tracking, video segmentation, structure from motion, gesture tracking, and so on.

DE Wildfire detection; Object detection; Deep learning; YOLO; Transformer
AB Wildfire is a common natural disaster that destroys the ecological environment and endangers the lives and property of people. The average precision and speed of wildfire detection algorithms are critical in complex wildfire detection scenarios. However, the complex wildfire scenarios and multi-scale flaming objects decrease the detection accuracy of the model. How to design an accurate and fast wildfire detection model is a challenging study. To improve the average detection precision of the model while reducing its computational cost as much as possible, we propose an efficient model for real-time wildfire detection in complex scenarios called FireDetn. First, we use four different detection heads to help FireDetn detect different size flame objects. Then, we integrate Transformer Encoder blocks with multi-head attention in FireDetn to enhance its ability to capture global feature information and contextual information, thus improving its average precision in complex scenarios. Finally, we fuse the spatial pyramid pooling fast structure, which benefits in detecting multi-scale flame objects at a lower computational cost. Our experimental results show that the FireDetn can detect about 112 frames per second, meeting the requirement of real-time detection. We also compare FireDetn with other algorithms, demonstrating that FireDetn obtains satisfactory results in average precision and speed.

AB With the rapid development of convolutional neural network (CNN), the accuracy of CNN has been significantly improved, which also brings great challenges to the deployment of mobile terminals or embedded devices with limited resources. Recently, significant achievements have been made in compressing CNN through low-rank decomposition. Unlike existing methods that use the same decomposition form and decomposition strategy with fine-tuning based on singular value decomposition (SVD), our method uses different decomposition forms for different layers, and proposes decomposition strategies without fine-tuning. We present a simple and effective scheme to compress the entire CNN, which is called cosine similarity SVD without fine-tuning. For the AlexNet, our cosine similarity algorithm of rank selection takes 84% of the time to find the rank compared with the bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) algorithm. After we tested various CNNs (AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet-50) on different data sets, experimental results show that the weight parameter drop can exceed 50% when the accuracy loss is less than 1% without fine-tuning. The floating point operations (FLOPs) drop is about 20%, and the accuracy loss is less than 1% without fine-tuning.

AB Shared images on the Internet are easily collected, classified, and analyzed by unauthorized commercial companies through Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The illegal use of these data damages the rights and interests of authorized companies and individuals. How to ensure that network-shared data is legally used by authorized users and not used by unauthorized DNNs has become an urgent problem. Reversible Adversarial Example (RAE) provides an effective solution, which can mislead the classification of unauthorized DNNs and does not affect the authorized users. The existing RAE schemes assumed that we could know the parameters of the target model and thus generate reversible adversarial examples. However, model parameters are often protected to avoid leakage, increasing the difficulty of generating accurate RAEs. In this paper, we first propose a Black-box Reversible Adversarial Example (B-RAE) scheme to generate robust reversible adversarial examples. We aim to protect image privacy while maintaining data usability in real scenarios. Experimental results and analysis have demonstrated that the proposed B-RAE is more effective and robust compared with the existing schemes. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a real-time video-stream enhancement scheme is proposed along with a hardware prototype development. The proposed technique employs a multi-linear adaptive gamma correction method to locally enhance the dark video frames in presence of high intensity optical sources. The proposed algorithm employs three linear functions corresponding to low, medium and high intensity regions for proper enhancement of different intensity regions. The slope and range of the linear functions are automatically derived from intensity distribution and hence the overall multi-linear function becomes highly nonlinear and adaptive to varying constraints. Consequently, the input-output mapping function of the algorithm works as a spreading function in the low intensity range for contrast improvement and preserves the information of the high intensity regions to avoid information loss due to over-enhancement. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance than various existing algorithms in terms of subjective and objective measures.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; NETWORK
AB RGB-D saliency detection integrates information from both RGB images and depth maps to improve the prediction of salient regions under challenging conditions. The key to RGB-D saliency detection is to fully mine and fuse information at multiple scales across the two modalities. Previous approaches tend to apply the multi-scale and multi-modal fusion separately via local operations, which fails to capture long-range dependencies. Here we propose a transformer-based structure to address this issue. The proposed architecture is composed of two modules: an Intra-modality Feature Enhancement Module (IFEM) and an Inter-modality Feature Fusion Module (IFFM). IFFM conducts a sufficient feature fusion by integrating features from multiple scales and two modalities over all positions simultaneously. IFEM enhances feature on each scale by selecting and integrating complementary information from other scales within the same modality before IFFM. We show that transformer is a uniform operation which presents great efficacy in both feature fusion and feature enhancement, and simplifies the model design. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed network performs favorably against most state-of-the-art RGB-D saliency detection methods. Furthermore, our model is efficient for having relatively smaller FLOPs and model size compared with other methods. (C) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition, with the development of the proposed method to run on the graphics card, the cross-checking process has been done without the need to change the reference image and without more calculation of the cost function. The results of this study show that the proposed method improved the quality of the responses compared to the previous study, and the obstacle detection rate in intelligent vehicles has increased to 41 pairs of frames per second. This processing rate is 477.40 times faster than the usual local stereo method and 33.77% faster than the previous study on the data fusion of ultrasonic and stereo vision.

AB A medical or business representative visits and spends some time (termed 'stay time') at different cities(nodes) for optimum return. With the rapid development of infrastructures worldwide, several vehicles and routes are available for transport between nodes. Road logistic transportation contributes 10.5% of the total emitted carbon emission (CE)1,2,3. Heuristic method is applied to solve NP-hard problems with continuous/discrete variables. With these facts, here, CE/tour-time constrained profit maximization of green four-dimensional Travelling Salesman Problems (PMG4DTSPs) with both discrete (travel times between nodes) and continuous (stay-times at nodes) variables are formulated. A travelling salesman visits all cities using the appropriate routes and conveyances, spend some time at each node, and some revenues are earned and spent depending upon the stay time at those visiting places. There are toll plazas on the roads, where three types of fixed charges (online, offline, mixed online-offline) are collected as road taxes to maintain the roads. A green constraint is incorporated in the form of limited emission. Several connecting routes between the cities and conveyances at each city are available for travel. Thus, these (PMG4DTSPs) are mixed integer linear programming problems (NP-hard), and to solve them, two hybrid heuristic methods, GA-ABC and GA-PSO, are developed and used. Here, GA and ABC/PSO are used for optimum routing plan and stay time, respectively. The models are illustrated numerically. Multi-path justification, online payment advantage and tour time limitation effect on profit are presented. Some behavioural studies of Green models and managerial decisions are presented.

ID SINGLE CAMERA
AB We present a new approach that combines spoken language and visual object detection to produce a depth image to perform metric monocular SLAM in real time and without requiring a depth or stereo camera. We propose a methodology where a compact matrix representation of the language and objects, along with a partitioning algorithm, is used to resolve the association between the objects mentioned in the spoken description and the objects visually detected in the image. The spoken language is processed online using Whisper, a popular automatic speech recognition system, while the YOLOv8 network is used for object detection. Camera pose estimation and mapping of the scene are performed using ORB-SLAM. The full system runs in real time, allowing a user to explore the scene with a handheld camera, observe the objects detected by YOLOv8, and provide depth information of these objects with respect to the camera via a spoken description. We have performed experiments in indoor and outdoor scenarios, comparing the resulting camera trajectory and map obtained with our approach against that obtained when using RGB-D images. Our results are comparable to those obtained with the latter without losing real-time performance.

AB In an automated box de-palletisation system that utilises robots, vision-based box recognition on the pallet plays the main role in providing picking guidelines. The complexity of the working condition and the target object, particularly the cluttered arrangement and various outer surfaces of the boxes, significantly affect the quality of the outcome. Typically, a large-scale vision dataset is required to train a deep learning object-detection model. However, considerable effort and time is required to achieve this. Therefore, this study proposes a Mask R-CNN-based detection approach for box objects, which is supported by a cycle generative adversarial network (Cycle GAN). The purpose of the Cycle-GAN is to optimise the outer surfaces of boxes by automatically erasing tags, stickers, labels, and symbols that exist on the boxes before loading them to the Mask R-CNN for detection. Subsequently, the obtained result was combined with the output from the developed boundary-enhancing technique that was applied to a depth map. Consequently, the box detection performance was significantly improved, and it was confirmed through experiments with a practical robot system in picking tasks. In the experiments, the success rate of the proposed method was validated using 200 cases of orderly and disorderly arrangements of boxes, respectively. Furthermore, the metric of the mean absolute error between the predicted picking point and the ground truth values for the test cases in the implementation process for the robot operation was also researched.

AB We consider the scheduling method that allows to minimize the traveling time of a AGV (and thus energy consumption) at each of zones, while to minimize the waiting time of the automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and/or containers for pickup and delivery (PD) at the transfer points (TPs) installed between adjacent zones in tandem systems. Scheduling for these tandem AGV systems is often not possible from a single point by a single intelligent agent. Intead, scheduling has to be performed using multiple intelligent agents. We consider the cooperative multi-agent scheduling (CMAS) scheme in which each agent employs a multi-offspring genetic algorithm. Coordination between the agents is used to improve their schedulings. This coordination can be in the form of serial scheme. We propose a novel CMAS method based on Lagrange theory and compare this to a non-cooperative scheduling approach between agents. The proposed method is verified at AGV system for a book printing process in Pyongyang Textbook Print Shop as the real-world experiment and it is shown that the CMAS method for tandem AGV system is effective.

DT Article
DE Frequent itemset mining; Frequent sequential pattern mining; Process
   mining; Log file pre-processing
AB Process mining is a technique for exploring models based on event sequences, growing in popularity in the process industry. Process mining algorithms assume that the processed log files contain events generated by only one unknown process, which can lead to extremely complex and inaccurate models when this assumption is not met. To address this issue, this article proposes a frequent pattern mining-based method for log file partitioning, allowing for the exploration of parallel processes. The key idea is that frequent pattern mining can identify grouped events and generate sub-logs of overlapping sub-processes. Thanks to the pre-processing of the log files, more compact and interpretable process models can be identified. We developed a set of goal-oriented metrics to evaluate the complexity of process mining problems and the resulting models. The applicability and effectiveness of the method are demonstrated in the analysis of process alarms of an industrial plant. The results confirm that the proposed method enables the discovery of targeted sub-process models by partitioning the log file using frequent pattern mining, and the effectiveness of the method increases with the number of parallel processes stored in the same log file. We recommend applying the method in every case where there is no clear start and end of the logged events so that the log file can describe different processes.

DE Identification of tomato leaf diseases; LMBRNet; CGDR; Visual
   enhancement
AB Tomato disease image identification plays a very important role in the field of agricultural production. Aiming at the problems of large intraclass differences, small inter-class differences and difficult feature extraction of some tomato leaf diseases, this paper proposes an identification of tomato leaf diseases based on LMBRNet. Firstly, a comprehensive grouped differentiated residual (CGDR) is built,The multi-branch structure of CGDR is used to capture the diversified feature information of tomato leaf diseases in different dimensions and receptive fields. then, a multiple residual connection scheme is adopted,using residuals to connect all layers, to ensure the maximum information transmission between layers in the network and to solve the problems of network degradation and gradient disappearance in the network training process. Secondly,the visual enhancement effectively fuses the results obtained by three different downsampling strategies using average pooling, max pooling, and 1*1 convolution. Avoid the loss of information caused by downsampling and improve the accuracy of the network. Moreover, deep separable convolution is used to optimize the network structure, reduce the amount of model parameters and reduce the computational resources occupied by training and deploying the model.we found that the depthwise separable convolution with a kernel size of 1*1 can slightly improve the efficiency of the model under the premise that it has little effect on the number of model parameters. The application results of more than 8000 images show that the overall identification accuracy is about 99.7%,higher than ResNet50(97.48%),GoogleNet(98.96%) etc. conventional models. The parameter amount of LMBRNet is 4.1M. Less than ResNet50(23M),GoogleNet(5.7M) etc. conventional models. It is worth noting that the accuracy of LMBRNet(99.7%) is similar to that of InceptionResNetV2(99.68%), but the amount of parameters of LMBRNet(4.1M) is much lower than that of InceptionResNetV2(54M). Moreover, the parameter amount of LMBRNet (4.1M) is slightly lower than that of MobileNetV2(2.2M), but the accuracy rate of LMBRNet(99.7%) is higher than that of MobileNetV2(97.87%). LMBRNet was tested on RS, SIW, Plantvillage-corn public datasets, all obtained high recognition accuracy, 82.32% on RS, 88.37% on SIW and 97.25% on Plantvillage-corn, indicating that LMBRNet has good generalization. Compare LMBRNet with advanced methods. In four different classification tasks, the performance of LMBRNet is similar to ResMLP12 and DCCAM-MRNet, and the difference of recognition accuracy between LMBRNet and ResMLP12 and DCCAM-MRNet is not more than 1%. However, the parameters of LMBRNet (4.1M) are lower than ResMLP12 (14.94M) and DCCAM MRNet (22.8M). LMBRNet is compared with MobileNetV3, an advanced lightweight classification model. LMBRNet(88.37% on SIW,82.32% ON RS) is used on certain datasets and performs better than MobileNetV3S(83.76% on SIW,75 on RS) and MobileNetV3L(84.34 on SIW,73.39 on RS). The parameters of LMBRNet(4.1M) are lower than MobileNetV3L(5.4M) and slightly higher than MobileNetV3S(2.9M). This indicates that LMBRNet has good generality even though it has a small number of parameters.

ID REGULARIZED CORRELATION FILTER
AB Although the discriminative correlation filter- (DCF)-based tracker improves tracking performance, some object representation issues can still be further optimized. On the one hand, the DCF tracker's deep convolutional features contain many noisy channels, and assigning the same weights to multiple channels cannot distinguish the importance of different channels. On the other hand, a simple weighted fusion approach cannot fully utilize the benefits of different feature types. We propose a visual object tracking algorithm based on adaptive channel weighting and feature game fusion to solve these problems. In this study, an adaptive channel weighting strategy is designed to assign suitable weights to each channel based on the average energy ratio of the target and background regions in the feature channels and prune the channels with low weights to improve feature robustness and reduce computational complexity. Simultaneously, the game theory concept is introduced in the multifeature fusion. The handcrafted features are combined with shallow and deep convolutional features according to feature complementarity. Then, the two combined features are seen as two sides of the game, continuously gamed during the tracking process to generate a feature model with a higher representation capacity. Extensive experiments are conducted on four mainstream visual tracking benchmark datasets, including OTB2015, VOT2018, LaSOT, and UAV123. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs outstandingly compared to the state-of-the-art trackers.

TI AD-Graph: Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection Graph Neural Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The main challenge faced by video-based real-world anomaly detection systems is the accurate learning of unusual events that are irregular, complicated, diverse, and heterogeneous in nature. Several techniques utilizing deep learning have been created to detect anomalies, yet their effectiveness on real-world data is often limited due to the insufficient incorporation of motion patterns. To address these problems and enhance the traditional functionality of anomaly detection systems for surveillance video data, we propose a weakly supervised graph neural-network-assisted video anomaly detection framework called AD-Graph. To identify temporal information from a series of frames, we extract 3D visual and motion features and represent these in a language-based knowledge graph format. Next, a robust clustering strategy is applied to group together meaningful neighbourhoods of the graph with similar vertices. Furthermore, spectral filters are applied to these graphs, and spectral graph theory is used to generate graph signals and detect anomalous events. Extensive experimental results over two challenging datasets, UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech, show improvements of 0.35% and 0.78% against a state-of-the-art model.

AB The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is an effective method for assessing risks and has great potential for assessing the structural safety of diversion tunnels. However, this type of professional assessment can become more complicated due to the presence of multiple factors that influence the safety of the tunnel. This complexity not only necessitates the establishment of a comprehensive index system but also introduces uncertainties related to inconsistencies in expert judgments and unknown expert weights in group decision-making process. To address these issues, this study proposed an improved FAHP method for the structural safety assessment of diversion tunnels. This method incorporates a proposed comprehensive index system and incorporates a preceding ordering process before pairwise comparisons in the questionnaire to enhance the consistency in expert judgment. The consistency and compatibility of expert judgment matrices are quantified using a distance vector rather than a single number, and a reasonable comprehensive weight is calculated based on the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. We applied this method to the structure safety assessment of the Houziyan hydropower station diversion tunnel and found an overall low risk for the tunnel, but significant issues were identified regarding lining crack. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative evaluation of the proposed method against other related methods, thereby demonstrating its high quality. The study contributes an improved FAHP method for the structural safety analysis of diversion tunnels and encourages the wider application of FAHP in more complicated systems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Traditional multi-view subspace representation learning typically captures the pairwise similarity among data objects but neglects the underlying relationship among subspace representations of different views, resulting in the essential structural information of multi-view data not being fully exploited. In this study, a multi-view representation learning approach is proposed using subspace transformation relationships. First, a subspace transformation relationship is defined to extract the underlying subspace relationship information. The transformation relationship is constrained by a low-rank term to enhance the consistency of the relationships and is used to construct a multi-view subspace representation model. Second, an optimization method is proposed for the multi-view subspace representation model using the ALM-ADM strategy. Third, a novel multi-view subspace rep-resentation learning algorithm is presented using the model and optimization method. Consequently, experimental findings on benchmark datasets indicated that the algorithm outperformed the state -of-the-art algorithm, benefitting from extracting subspace transformation relationships to guarantee high-order correlation information from multi-view data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB IntroductionStroke-related deficits often include motor impairments and gait dysfunction, leading to a limitation of social activities and consequently affecting the quality of life of stroke survivors. Neurorehabilitation takes advantage of the contribution of different techniques in order to achieve more benefits for patients. Robotic devices help to improve the outcomes of physical rehabilitation. Moreover, motor imagery seems to play a role in neurological rehabilitation since it leads to the activation of the same brain areas as actual movements. This study investigates the use of a combined physical and cognitive protocol for gait rehabilitation in stroke patients. MethodsSpecifically, we tested the efficacy of a 5-week training program using a robotic orthosis (P.I.G.R.O.) in conjunction with motor imagery training. Twelve chronic stroke patients participated in the study. We evaluated balance and gait performance before and after the training. Six of them underwent fMRI examination before and after the training to assess the effects of the protocol on brain plasticity mechanisms in motor and imagery tasks. ResultsOur results show that the rehabilitation protocol can effectively improve gait performance and balance and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients. Furthermore, the fMRI results suggest that rehabilitation is associated with cerebral plastic changes in motor networks. DiscussionThe present findings, if confirmed by future research, have the potential to advance the development of new, more effective rehabilitation approaches for stroke patients, improving their quality of life and reducing the burden of stroke-related disability.

AB The process of data analytics on large-scale government administrative data - that belong to various domains like education, transport, energy, and health - can be enhanced by retrieving pertinent documents from diverse data sources. Without a supporting framework of metadata, big data analytics can be daunting. Even though statistical algorithms can perform extensive analyses on a variety of data with little help from metadata, applying these techniques to heterogeneous data may not always result in reliable findings. Recently, semantics-aware (or semantic search) search techniques received much attention as they utilize implicit knowledge to enhance the search. Similarly, traditional search engines rely on the inherent linkages within the underlying data model to improve their search quality. In the case of general-purpose information retrieval systems, to gather information from the internet (open access data) or to access open government administrative data, a domain agnostic ontology shall be employed to supply background knowledge. This paper draws on research undertaken by the authors at IIIT Bangalore Center for Open Data Research (CODR) in developing a semantics-aware data lake framework to host and analyze government administrative data. In this study, we present an ontology-based document retrieval solution where an ontology serves as an intermediary to close the gap between what the user seeks and what the search retrieves. Although our study settings are based on the Government of Karnataka (GoK, India), we believe the findings have wider resonance. Our experimental results based on agricultural data from the GoK look promising.

AB Legal inference is fundamental for building and verifying hypotheses in police investigations. In this study, we build a Natural Language Inference dataset in Korean for the legal domain, focusing on criminal court verdicts. We developed an adversarial hypothesis collection tool that can challenge the annotators and give us a deep understanding of the data, and a hypothesis network construction tool with visualized graphs to show a use case scenario of the developed model. The data is augmented using a combination of Easy Data Augmentation approaches and round-trip translation, as crowd-sourcing might not be an option for datasets with sensible data. We extensively discuss challenges we have encountered, such as the annotator's limited domain knowledge, issues in the data augmentation process, problems with handling long contexts and suggest possible solutions to the issues. Our work shows that creating legal inference datasets with limited resources is feasible and proposes further research in this area.

DE Few-shot object detection; Fractal object; Gradient combination; YOLOv7
AB In practical industrial visual inspection tasks, foreign object data are difficult to collect and accumulate, hence few-shot object detection has gradually become the focus of research. It has been observed that industrial foreign objects are often different from natural data and are always fractal objects. Its form is a rough or fragmented geometric shape, and its features are relatively monotonous and difficult to distinguish. Optimization-based meta-learning is a powerful approach to few-shot learning. It updates model weights through a parameter optimization strategy enabling more efficient learning when faced with new tasks with few samples. Therefore, we proposed a gradient scout strategy, which used the intelligent optimization idea to optimize the meta-training outer-loop parallel gradient optimization method to improve the training effect of few-shot fractal object detection. Meanwhile, we proposed a fractal information amplified learning module, which could improve the detection ability of few-shot fractal objects more quickly under the same training period. They formed FLGS (fractal information amplified learning with gradient scout), which was deployed at zero cost. YOLOv7 was advanced to a new industrial fractal object detection model under FLGS. The experimental results on the IGBT surface foreign object dataset showed that our gradient scout strategy was superior to the other eight few-shot meta-learning algorithms. FLGS significantly accelerated the improvement of fractal object detection ability and maintained a high-level mean average precision.

AB Hand pose estimation is a challenging task in hand-object interaction scenarios due to the uncertainty caused by object occlusions. Inspired by human reasoning from a hand-object interaction video sequence, we propose a hand pose estimation model. It uses three cascaded modules to imitate human's estimation and observation process. The first module predicts an initial pose based on the visible information and the prior hand knowledge. The second module updates the hand shape memory based on the new information coming from the subsequent frames. The bone's length updating is initiated by the predicted joint's reliability. The third module refines the coarse pose according to the hand-object contact state represented by the object's Signed Distance Function field. Our model gets the mean joints estimation error of 21.3 mm, the Procrustes error of 9.9 mm, and the Trans & Scale error of 22.3 mm on HO3Dv2, and Root-Relative error of 12.3 mm on DexYCB which are superior to other state-of-the-art models.

AB Unloading activities directly impact the progress of earthmoving and filling projects, and a reliable multistep-ahead unloading duration prediction could help optimize equipment scheduling and improve operational efficiency. However, unloading prediction is greatly challenging owing to the complex uncertainties and nonlinearities implied in the unloading process, as well as the difficulty of modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Thus, this study devises a new fuzzy sequence-to-sequence network for unloading time forecasting. First, a quantization error-improved information granulation method is exploited to establish the fuzzy partition function. The global and localized distribution characteristics of unloading time are utilized to adaptively optimize the number and distribution of nonuniform fuzzy intervals. Then, periodic and recent branches were developed to model the variation of unloading time in multiple temporal granularities. In each branch, based on the encoder-decoder structure, the underlying gated recurrent units learn the sequence features collaborating with the attention mechanism to capture implicit long-term dependencies, mitigating the effects of error accumulation in multistep forecasting. Finally, the temporal information of different granularities is fused to form the final prediction. We evaluate the proposed model using an unloading dataset from a heavy infrastructure project in southwest China. We conducted geo-fencing and unloading operation analysis to extract the unloading information of different construction areas. The experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality multistep predictions for unloading duration, and exhibits superior performance compared with baseline models. The novel approach has great potential to support earthwork management in complex environments.

AB Most of the existing deep learning-based image super-resolution methods require a large number of datasets or ground truth. However, these methods are not suitable for the restoration of real image with different domains. Recently, Deep Image Prior (DIP) based on single-image explores image prior and uses network structure as implicit image prior to recover images, but it ignores the explicit prior information of the actual image itself. The addition of image prior can effectively alleviate the ill-posed problem in the image restoration model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep image super-resolution (SR) method that based on segmentation driven. Intuitively, clear image has a clearer segmentation boundary. It will drive deep neural networks to obtain higher performance SR image when forcing the restored image to have clear boundary. In order to make energy flow into DIP better, we use the fully convolutional networks-based superpixel method, and we use back propagation to inject the gradient generated by segmentation entropy energy into DIP to obtain lower energy optimization parameters. Experiments show that the image generated by our method has clearer boundary and better performance than that generated by DIP on Set5, Set14 and BSD100.

AB English language translation teaching plays a crucial role in today's globalized world, particularly in countries like China, which has seen an increased emphasis on English language proficiency. However, effective teaching and assessment of students' translation abilities remain significant challenges for educators. To address the challenges of English language translation and teaching, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Neural Network algorithms to assist teachers in evaluating and assessing students' English translation abilities by enabling them to better fulfill their teaching responsibilities. This paper first describes the computational mechanism of Neural Network algorithm using PSO, which includes the particle coding approach. An application model is designed to assess students' capacity for learning using English translational instruction. The PSO algorithm gathers information on their learning progress, and fully utilize the analyzed results to develop learning strategies and create teaching materials for various learning types, which is helpful for the quick advancement of English translation teaching. Secondly, this paper develops a translational application model for English language as a practical framework. The proposed method utilizes the upgraded PSO-enabled Neural Network to process English language translation and teaching data by achieving network training in a global optimal state of PSO by reducing training errors. Thirdly, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the model by comparing the average errors of the training and test samples with different numbers of particles such as 5, 10, and 20. Finally, the results demonstrate high accuracy in measuring students' translation abilities. Furthermore, the study collects and examines three data sets, specifically English-Foreign Language Translation Corpus (EFLT), English Language Learners' Corpus (ELLC), and English-Multilingual Parallel Corpus (EMPC), with a detection accuracy of 0.84, 0.97, and 0.65, respectively.

AB Excessive energy reliance and uncontrolled exploitation have caused significant environmental damage by prompting experts to advocate for active protection and conservation of Earth's habitats. Preserving urban wetlands is crucial for reducing natural disasters and maintaining city biodiversity. Therefore, this paper addresses the urgent need for active protection and conservation of urban wetlands due to the significant environmental damage caused by excessive energy reliance and uncontrolled exploitation. Establishing a complete urban wetland ecosystem is crucial to ensure the long-term viability of these fragile ecological environments. Using big data and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this study proposes a method to evaluate the plant landscape quality of Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, China. The proposed approach assesses and prioritizes urban wetland park landscapes by considering important ecological variables such as plant species diversity and wetland water ecology. Expert assessments generate a valid judgment matrix and assign weights to each evaluation index by providing insights into the influence of indicators on the park landscape. Demographic data analysis, including age, gender, education, and occupation, is considered to understand preferences. Based on the results of the evaluation, ten sample plots of Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, were classified into four grades (Grade I > 13.5; Grade II > 12-13.5; Grade III > 10.5-12; Grade IV 10.5), with Grades 1-3 accounting for 90% of the total. The evaluation scores confirm the visually appealing plant landscape of the park, with notable locations such as the main entrance, Huxin Square, and Yingying Road standing out for their lush vegetation and distinct ecological characteristics. This study outperforms previous research using a complete evaluation model and the AHP approach, allowing for a systematic assessment of the landscape quality of urban wetland parks. This localized research captures unique biological traits and gives significant insights into park management by concentrating on Dongpu National Wetland Park in Luyang, Anhui, China.

AB Deciphering gene regulatory networks' functioning is an essential step for better understanding of life, as these networks play a fundamental role in the control of cellular processes. Boolean networks have been widely used to represent gene regulatory networks. They allow to describe the dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks straightforwardly and efficiently. The attractors are essential in the analysis of the dynamics of a Boolean network. They explain that a particular cell can acquire specific phenotypes that may be transmitted over several generations. In this work, we consider a new representation of Boolean networks' dynamics based on a new semantics used in Answer Set Programming (ASP). We use logic programs and ASP to express and deal with gene regulatory networks seen as Boolean networks, and develop a method to detect all the attractors of such networks. We first show how to represent and deal with general Boolean networks for the synchronous and asynchronous updates modes, where the computation of attractors requires a simulation of these networks' dynamics. Then, we propose an approach for the particular case of circular networks where no simulation is needed. This last specific case plays an essential role in biological systems. We show several theoretical properties; in particular, simple attractors of the gene networks are represented by the stable models of the corresponding logic programs and cyclic attractors by its extra-stable models. These extra-stable models correspond to the extra-extensions of the new semantics that are not captured by the semantics of stable models. We then evaluate the proposed approach for general Boolean networks on real biological networks and the one dedicated to the case of circular networks on Boolean networks generated randomly. The obtained results for both approaches are encouraging.

AB Nguyen et al. (2016) introduced altruistic hedonic games in which agents' utilities depend not only on their own preferences but also on those of their friends in the same coalition. We propose to extend their model to coalition formation games in general, considering also the friends in other coalitions. Comparing our model to altruistic hedonic games, we argue that excluding some friends from the altruistic behavior of an agent is a major disadvantage that comes with the restriction to hedonic games. After introducing our model and showing some desirable properties, we additionally study some common stability notions and provide a computational analysis of the associated verification and existence problems.

ID DATA IMPUTATION
AB With the advent of the big data era, the data quality problem is becoming more critical. Among many factors, data with missing values is one primary issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic in the research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ neural network models such as self-organizing mappings or automatic encoders for filling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover interrelated features and common features simultaneously among data attributes. Especially, it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they often learn invalid constant mappings, which dramatically hurts the filling performance. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a missing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We first incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists of de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the ability of learning interrelated features and common features. Besides, we develop a missing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering that is incorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance the multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic collaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by extensive experiments compared to a variety of baseline methods on thirteen data sets.

AB Remote sensing image scene classification methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been extremely successful. However, the limitations of CNN itself make it difficult to acquire global information. The traditional Vision Transformer can effectively capture long-distance dependencies for acquiring global information, but it is computationally intensive. In addition, each class of scene in remote sensing images has a large quantity of the similar background or foreground features. To effectively leverage those similar features and reduce the computation, a highly efficient lightweight vision transformer (HELViT) is proposed. HELViT is a hybrid model combining CNN and Transformer and consists of the Convolution and Attention Block (CAB), the Convolution and Token Merging Block (CTMB). Specifically, in CAB module, the embedding layer in the original Vision Transformer is replaced with a modified MBConv (MBConv(*)), and the Fast Multi-Head Self Attention (F-MHSA) is used to change the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism to linear. To further decreasing the model's computational cost, CTMB employs the adaptive token merging (ATOME) to fuse some related foreground or background features. The experimental results on the UCM, AID and NWPU datasets show that the proposed model displays better results in terms of accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art remote sensing scene classification methods. On the most challenging NWPU dataset, HELViT achieves the highest accuracy of 94.64%/96.84% with 4.6G GMACs for 10%/20% training samples, respectively.

AB In recent years, a surge of criminal activities with cross-cryptocurrency trades have emerged in Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain platform. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods utilize the traditional machine learning with feature engineering or graph representation learning technique to capture the information in transaction network. However, these methods either ignore the timestamp information and the transaction flow direction information in transaction network or only consider single transaction network, the cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns in Ethereum are usually ignored. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-layer Temporal Transaction Anomaly Detection (MT(2)AD) model in Ethereum network with graph neural network. Specifically, for a given Ethereum token transaction network, we first extract its initial features including the structure subgraph and edge's feature. Then, we model the temporal information in subgraph as a series of network snapshots according to the timestamp on each edge and time window. To capture the cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns, we combine the snapshots from multiple token transactions at a given timestamp, and we consider it as a new combined graph. We further use the graph convolution encoder with attention mechanism and pooling operation on this new graph to obtain the graph level embedding, and we transform the anomaly detection on dynamic multi-layer Ethereum transaction networks as a graph classification task with these graph-level embeddings. MT(2)AD can integrate the transaction structure feature, edge's feature and cross-cryptocurrency trading patterns into a framework to perform the anomaly detection with graph neural networks. Experiments on three real-world multi-layer transaction networks show that the proposed MT(2)AD (0.8789 Precision, 0.9375 Recall, 0.4987 FbMacro and 0.9351 FbWeighted) can achieve the best performance on most evaluation metrics in comparison with some competing approaches, and the effectiveness in consideration of multiple tokens is also demonstrated.

AB The primary objective of this research is to examine how the Russia-Ukraine war impacted the global economy. To achieve this goal, we propose operational laws, a score and accuracy function, and a divergence measure for complex dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Furthermore, we investigate the challenges associated with multi-criteria decision-making (MCR) using aggregation operators and the TODIM method with complex dual hesitant fuzzy (CDHF) information. Drawing inspiration from arithmetic aggregation operations, we introduce several aggregation operators for complex dual hesitant fuzzy information, including the complex dual hesitant fuzzy weighted average (CDHFWA) operator, complex dual hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted average (CDHFOWA) operator, and complex dual hesitant fuzzy hybrid average (CDHFHA) operator. We thoroughly analyze the unique characteristics of these proposed operators and use them in conjunction with the TODIM method to develop practical approaches for solving complex dual hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. To validate our approach and demonstrate its applicability, we provide a practical example of how the Russia-Ukraine war affected the global economy. Our study confirms the effectiveness of our approach and highlights how it can be used to solve real-world problems.

DE Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs); Evolutionary
   algorithms; Coevolution; Parallel algorithm; Staging strategy
AB Lots of real-world optimization problems are inherently constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), but the existing constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) often fail to balance convergence and diversity effectively. Therefore, a novel constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on three-stage multi-population coevolution (CMOEA-TMC) for complex CMOPs is proposed. CMOEA-TMC contains two populations, called mainPop and helpPop, which evolve with and without consideration of constraints, respectively. The proposed algorithm divides the search process into three stages. In the first stage, fast convergence is achieved by transforming the original multi-objective problems into multiple single-objective problems. Coarse-grained parallel evolution of subpopulations in mainPop and guidance information provided by helpPop can facilitate mainPop to quickly approach the Pareto front. In the second stage, the objective function of mainPop changes to the original problem. Coevolution of mainPop and helpPop by sharing offsprings can produce solutions with better diversity. In the third stage, the mining of the global optimal solutions is performed, discarding helpPop to save computational resources. For CMOEA-TMC, the combination of parallel evolution, coevolution, and staging strategy makes it easier for mainPop to converge and maintain good diversity. Experimental results on 33 benchmark CMOPs and a real-world boiler combustion optimization case show that CMOEA-TMC is more competitive than the other five advanced CMOEAs.

ID FEATURE AUGMENTATION
AB Features of data are much critical to the classification. However, when only small data are available, suitable features can not be easily obtained, easily leading to the bad classification performance. This paper propose a novel approach to automatically learns features from the irrelevant domain with much discriminative features for the given classification task. It first computes as the learning objectives the central vectors of each class in the irrelevant domain, and then uses machine learning method to automatically learn features for each sample in the target domain from these objectives. The merits of our method lie in that unlike the transfer learning, our method does not require the similarity between two domains. It can learn features from much discriminative domains. Its learned features are not limited to its original ones, unlike feature selection and feature extraction methods, so that the classification performance with the learned features can be better. Finally, our method is much general, simple, and efficient. Lots of experimental results validated the proposed method.

DE Federated learning; Kafka; Secure aggregation; Differential privacy
AB Federated learning (FL) draws attention in academia and industry due to its privacy-preserving capability in training machine learning models. However, there are still some critical security attacks and vulnerabilities, including gradients leakage and interference attacks. Meanwhile, communication is another bottleneck in basic FL schemes since large-scale FL parameter transmission leads to inefficient communication, latency, and slower learning processes. To overcome these shortcomings, different communication efficiency strategies and privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques have been proposed. However, a single method can only partially resist privacy attacks. This paper presents a practical, privacy-preserving scheme combining cryptographic techniques and communication networking solutions. We implement Kafka for message distribution, the Diffie-Hellman scheme for secure server aggregation, and gradient differential privacy for interference attack prevention. The proposed approach maintains training efficiency while being able to addressing gradients leakage problems and interference attacks. Meanwhile, the implementation of Kafka and Zookeeper provides asynchronous communication and anonymous authenticated computation with role-based access controls. Finally, we prove the privacy-preserving properties of the proposed solution via security analysis and empirically demonstrate its efficiency and practicality.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB The one-stage object detector has been widely applied in many computer vision applications due to its high detection efficiency and simple framework. However, one-stage detectors heavily rely on Non-maximum Suppression to remove the duplicated predictions for the same objects, and the detectors produce detection confidence to measure the quality of those predictions. The localisation quality is an important factor to evaluate the predicted bounding boxes, but its role has not been fully utilised in previous works. To alleviate the problem, the Quality Prediction Block (QPB), a lightweight sub-network, is designed by the authors, which strengthens the effect of localisation quality evaluation on detection confidence by leveraging the features of predicted bounding boxes. The QPB is simple in structure and applies to different forms of detection confidence. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public benchmarks, MS COCO, PASCAL VOC and Berkeley DeepDrive. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the detectors with various forms of detection confidence. The proposed approach also achieves better performance in the stronger one-stage detectors.

AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide communicative alternatives to those without functional speech. Covert speech (CS)-based BCIs enable communication simply by thinking of words and thus have intuitive appeal. However, an elusive barrier to their clinical translation is the collection of voluminous examples of high-quality CS signals, as iteratively rehearsing words for long durations is mentally fatiguing. Research on CS and speech perception (SP) identifies common spatiotemporal patterns in their respective electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, pointing towards shared encoding mechanisms. The goal of this study was to investigate whether a model that leverages the signal similarities between SP and CS can differentiate speech-related EEG signals online. Ten participants completed a dyadic protocol where in each trial, they listened to a randomly selected word and then subsequently mentally rehearsed the word. In the offline sessions, eight words were presented to participants. For the subsequent online sessions, the two most distinct words (most separable in terms of their EEG signals) were chosen to form a ternary classification problem (two words and rest). The model comprised a functional mapping derived from SP and CS signals of the same speech token (features are extracted via a Riemannian approach). An average ternary online accuracy of 75.3% (60% chance level) was achieved across participants, with individual accuracies as high as 93%. Moreover, we observed that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CS signals was enhanced by perception-covert modeling according to the level of high-frequency (?-band) correspondence between CS and SP. These findings may lead to less burdensome data collection for training speech BCIs, which could eventually enhance the rate at which the vocabulary can grow.

AB Many production processes are characterized by numerous and complex cause-and-effect relationships. Since they are only partially known, they pose a challenge to effective process control. In this work we present how Structural Equation Models can be used for deriving cause-and-effect relationships from the combination of prior knowledge and process data in the manufacturing domain. Compared to earlier applications, we do not assume linear relationships leading to more informative results. Furthermore, our results indicate that including expert knowledge seems to be able to reduce the difference between the learned cause-effect relationships and the expert assessment, thus opening a promising direction for future research on manufacturing processes.

AB Companies must be able to identify their suppliers appropriately and effectively in order to survive in the competitive market conditions. In order to fulfill and surpass the expectations of the consumers and clients, companies need to interact with the relevant suppliers. It is a tough manner for companies to select the best supplier from a large number of relevant alternatives. The selection process of the appropriate supplier involves multiple interacting and competing factors. Generally, the selection process and its results cause a waste of time and money. For this purpose, MCDM methodologies are utilized to manage this complex process efficiently. MCDMs allows for consistent and accurate decision-making as well as the selection of the most appropriate supplier. MCDM is one the most preferred tool to select the best alternative under the conflicting and competitive criteria when the evaluations are made in crisp numbers. Therefore, MCDM methods are preferred in various applications in academia and real life. However, the evaluations could not be always possible with crisp numbers, especially in vague environments or evaluations needs qualitative data. This study is one of the first to combine the AHP and COPRAS supplier selection methods with interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IPF) logic. The effectiveness of these IPF-AHP and IPF-COPRAS evaluations for the supplier selection problem is compared and examined. The experimental results of case scenarios show that IPF is an effective way to apply in decision-making applications. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the proposed methodologies. According to sensitivity analysis, the IPF-AHP and IPF-COPRAS be able to illustrate the effects of small changings in criteria weights. Therefore, companies can use the IPF-AHP and IPF-COPRAS to assist their decision-makers in identifying and selecting the best suppliers.

TI Algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation for clinical machine learning

AB The tendency of machine learning algorithms to learn biases from training data calls for methods to mitigate unfairness before deployment to healthcare and other applications. Yang et al. propose a reinforcement-learning-based method for algorithmic bias mitigation and demonstrate it on COVID-19 screening and patient discharge prediction tasks.
   As models based on machine learning continue to be developed for healthcare applications, greater effort is needed to ensure that these technologies do not reflect or exacerbate any unwanted or discriminatory biases that may be present in the data. Here we introduce a reinforcement learning framework capable of mitigating biases that may have been acquired during data collection. In particular, we evaluated our model for the task of rapidly predicting COVID-19 for patients presenting to hospital emergency departments and aimed to mitigate any site (hospital)-specific and ethnicity-based biases present in the data. Using a specialized reward function and training procedure, we show that our method achieves clinically effective screening performances, while significantly improving outcome fairness compared with current benchmarks and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We performed external validation across three independent hospitals, and additionally tested our method on a patient intensive care unit discharge status task, demonstrating model generalizability.

AB Traditionally, sensitivity analysis has been utilized to determine the importance of input variables to a deep neural network (DNN). However, the quantification of sensitivity for each neuron in a network presents a significant challenge. In this article, a selective method for calculating neuron sensitivity in layers of neurons concerning network output is proposed. This approach incorporates scaling factors that facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuron importance. Additionally, a hierarchical multi-scale optimization framework is proposed, where layers with high-importance neurons are selectively optimized. Unlike the traditional backpropagation method that optimizes the whole network at once, this alternative approach focuses on optimizing the more important layers. This paper provides fundamental theoretical analysis and motivating case study results for the proposed neural network treatment. The framework is shown to be effective in network optimization when applied to simulated and UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets. This alternative training generates local minima close to or even better than those obtained with the backpropagation method, utilizing the same starting points for comparative purposes within a multi-start optimization procedure. Moreover, the proposed approach is observed to be more efficient for large-scale DNNs. These results validate the proposed algorithmic framework as a rigorous and robust new optimization methodology for training (fitting) neural networks to input/output data series of any given system.

ID AGGREGATION OPERATORS; FRAMEWORK
AB An aggregation operator of linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIVIFNs) is an important tool for solving cognitively inspired decision-making problems with LIVIFNs. So far, many aggregation operators of LIVIFNs have been presented. Each of these operators works well in its specific context. But they are not always monotone because their operational rules are not always invariant and persistent. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, a general framework for modelling epistemic uncertainty, was found to provide the capability for operational rules of fuzzy numbers to overcome these limitations. In this paper, a weighted averaging operator of LIVIFNs based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for cognitively inspired decision-making is proposed. Firstly, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is introduced into linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment and a definition of LIVIFNs under this theory is given. Based on this, four novel operational rules of LIVIFNs are developed and proved to be always invariant and persistent. Using the developed operational rules, a new weighted averaging operator of LIVIFNs is constructed and proved to be always monotone. Based on the constructed operator, a method for solving cognitively inspired decision-making problems with LIVIFNs is presented. The application of the presented method is illustrated via a numerical example. The effectiveness and advantage of the method are demonstrated via quantitative comparisons with several existing methods. For the numerical example, the best alternative determined by the presented method is exactly the same as that determined by other comparison methods. For some specific problems, only the presented method can generate intuitive ranking results. The demonstration results suggest that the presented method is effective in solving cognitively inspired decision-making problems with LIVIFNs. Furthermore, the method will not produce counterintuitive ranking results since its operational rules are always invariant and persistent and its aggregation operator is always monotone.

AB The Pythagorean fuzzy sets have achieved remarkable success in curbing uncertainty in real-world problems. Distance measures are widely used to handle uncertainty and discriminate between two objects in a Pythagorean fuzzy environment. The literature suggests that many of the existing distance functions need to meet the circumstances of metric conditions. In addition to that, the calculation via some measures is error-prone as well as gives unreasonable results. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, we determine a new metric for Pythagorean fuzzy sets using the assistance of the K-L divergence measure. Many mathematical properties of the introduced measure are discussed. Furthermore, geometrical representation is provided. A comparative study of the proposed and existing distance measures is carried out to establish the superiority of the new measure. Numerical examples provided here have successfully assessed the efficiency and feasibility of the introduced measure in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, and decision-making problem.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global threat that is making industrial managers rethink their supply chain (SC) structures in an uncertain business environment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, global SCs have been severely disrupted, triggering the need for a supply chain resilience (SCR) model. Based on the literature and expert input, 15 SCR drivers for the manufacturing industry were identified in three categories, namely, absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacity. The approximate fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (AFDEMATEL) method was used to categorize these 15 SCR drivers into cause-and-effect groups and produce a priority list of the SCR drivers. System robustness, geographically dispersed multiple suppliers, and risk management culture are the top three critical SCR drivers, respectively, in the cause group, and all three are associated with the absorptive capacity of the manufacturing industry. Agile supply chain, contingency planning, and restoration of resources are the least important drivers, respectively, in the effect group. In an uncertain environment, the critical SCR drivers are system robustness and risk management culture. The study results will help supply chain managers formulate strategic policies to achieve supply chain resilience in an uncertain business environment.

DE Visual object tracking; Siamese network; Motion prediction; Adaptive

AB Siamese networks enable end-to-end training for visual tracking, achieving excellent performance in recent years. However, classical Siamese-based formulation relies on an offline-trained appearance model to perform tracking for each frame, ignoring the temporal variation at the online stage. As been verified that temporal motion is crucial for robust and accurate tracking, we propose a novel Motion-Perceive Siamese network (SiamMP) that explicitly predicts motion patterns, providing complementary clues for the appearance-only formulation. Specifically, successive historical frames are collected, with their appearance and potential trajectory being employed to predict the next state, achieving motion awareness correspondingly. Besides, an adaptive fusion module is dedicated to performing a decision-level negotiation between the tracking evidence of the appearance and the motion models. To verify the effectiveness and merit of our SiamMP, extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging benchmarks, including LaSOT, OTB100, GOT-10k, TC128, and DTB70. The comparison and analysis of the obtained results demonstrate the necessity and validity of involving the motion-perceive design in the Siamese framework.

AB Using the constituent stocks of the iShares MSCI US ESG Select Index ETF, a matrix of technical indicators, returns, and covariance is incorporated to represent the inherent information characteristics of the stock market. In this study, based on the proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management on Environmental, Social, and Governance (DRLPMESG) architecture model, investors who use active portfolio management reap the greatest rewards, as the portfolio with 5 stocks performing the best, with an annualized return of 46.58%, a Sharpe ratio of 1.37, and a cumulative return of 115.18%, indicating that the results have the potential to win the market and generate excess profits. In contrast to the efficient market hypothesis, this new understanding of proven effectiveness in obtaining satisfactory rewards would help improve investment strategies for portfolio management. Furthermore, this study proposed that holding 5 stocks in a portfolio can lead to higher returns, laying the foundation for future research on the number of holdings. Moreover, when compared to previous static strategies, this model offering a dynamic strategy may generate a more stable return in the face of market fluctuations.

AB Persistent homology is a computationally intensive and yet extremely powerful tool for Topological Data Analysis. Applying the tool on potentially infinite sequence of data objects is a challenging task. For this reason, persistent homology and data stream mining have long been two important but disjoint areas of data science. The first computational model, that was recently introduced to bridge the gap between the two areas, is useful for detecting steady or gradual changes in data streams, such as certain genomic modifications during the evolution of species. However, that model is not suitable for applications that encounter abrupt changes of extremely short duration. This paper presents another model for computing persistent homology on streaming data that addresses the shortcoming of the previous work. The model is validated on the important real-world application of network anomaly detection. It is shown that in addition to detecting the occurrence of anomalies or attacks in computer networks, the proposed model is able to visually identify several types of traffic. Moreover, the model can accurately detect abrupt changes of extremely short as well as longer duration in the network traffic. These capabilities are not achievable by the previous model or by traditional data mining techniques.

AB For spectral clustering algorithm, the quality of eigenvectors of graph affinity matrix is very important for the clustering result. So, how to obtain high-quality eigenvectors is crucial. In this paper, the authors aim to propose some new measurement methods to evaluate each eigenvector of affinity matrix for spectral selection. Based on extended information entropy, three criteria, i.e. Spectral Distinguishability (SD), Spectral Distinguishability Validity (SDV) and pectral Distinguishability -Degree (SDD), are defined respectively. The compactness of clusters for each eigenvector is measured by SD; SDV is used to remove the inefficient eigenvectors for clustering; SDD is used to evaluate the contribution of eigenvectors to clustering and is exploited to build a selective spectral ensemble scheme. To indicate the merits of the authors' algorithm, the authors consider varied artificial data and natural images, including Berkeley image segmentation data set as benchmark data set. The authors' simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in developing spectral clustering compared to conventional clustering methods and recent eigenvectors-selection-based algorithms.

TI Node classification across networks via category-level domain adaptive

DE Node classification across networks; Graph neural networks; Domain
   adaptation; Transfer learning
AB To improve the performance of classifying nodes on unlabeled or scarcely-labeled networks, the task of node classification across networks is proposed for transferring knowledge from similar networks with rich labels. As data distribution shift exists across networks, domain adaptive network embedding is proposed to overcome such challenge by learning network-invariant and discriminative node embeddings, in which domain adaptation technique is applied to network embedding for reducing domain discrepancy. However, existing works merely discuss category-level domain discrepancy which is crucial to better adaptation and classification. In this paper, we propose category-level domain adaptive network embedding. The key idea is minimizing intra-class domain discrepancy and maximizing inter-class domain discrepancy between source and target networks simultaneously. To further enhance classification performance on target network, we reduce embedding variation inside each class and enlarge it between different classes. Graph attention network is adopted for learning network embeddings. In addition, a novel pseudo-labeling strategy for target network is developed to better compute category-level information. Theoretical analysis guarantees the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-art performance, in particular, outperforming existing domain adaptive network embedding models by up to 32%.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Communications; Graph attention
   networks; Traffic signal control; Graphs
AB Traffic signal control (TSC) can be described as a multi-agent cooperative game. To realize cooperation, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant approach, with communication being a core component. The large-scale traffic signals and the partially observable information in TSC pose a considerable challenge in finding the optimal joint control policy. This paper proposed a deep MARL model named attentional graph relations communications network (AGRCNet). Based on the Actor-Critic framework, AGRCNet designs a communication network to exchange observation information with agents to help obtain the optimal joint action, reducing the decision error caused by the partially observable condition. Specifically, through the communication network, the chain propagation of graph attention networks (GAT) and graph convolutional networks is used to expand the receptive domain of agents, improve communication efficiency and promote cooperative behavior. We simulate the traffic situation near the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in Simulation of Urban MObility. With a compound reward, our method performs best. Meanwhile, AGRCNet is applied to two abstract environments, and the results show that our approach can also adapt to dynamic agent relationships and is more efficient than comparison algorithms.

AB Identification of clusters of co-expressed genes in transcriptomic data is a difficult task. Most algorithms used for this purpose can be classified into two broad categories: distance-based or model-based approaches. Distance-based approaches typically utilize a distance function between pairs of data objects and group similar objects together into clusters. Model-based approaches are based on using the mixture-modeling framework. Compared to distance-based approaches, model-based approaches offer better interpretability because each cluster can be explicitly characterized in terms of the proposed model. However, these models present a particular difficulty in identifying a correct multivariate distribution that a mixture can be based upon. In this manuscript, we review some of the approaches used to select a distribution for the needed mixture model first. Then, we propose avoiding this problem altogether by using a nonparametric MSL (maximum smoothed likelihood) algorithm. This algorithm was proposed earlier in statistical literature but has not been, to the best of our knowledge, applied to transcriptomics data. The salient feature of this approach is that it avoids explicit specification of distributions of individual biological samples altogether, thus making the task of a practitioner easier. We performed both a simulation study and an application of the proposed algorithm to two different real datasets. When used on a real dataset, the algorithm produces a large number of biologically meaningful clusters and performs at least as well as several other mixture-based algorithms commonly used for RNA-seq data clustering. Our results also show that this algorithm is capable of uncovering clustering solutions that may go unnoticed by several other model-based clustering algorithms.

AB Since manually labeling images is expensive and labor intensive, in practice we often do not have enough labeled images to train an effective classifier for the new image classification tasks. The graph-based SSL methods have received more attention in practice due to their convexity, scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based semi-supervised learning method that takes full advantage of a small set of labeled graphs and a large set of unlabeled graph data. First, we explain the concept of graph-based semi-supervised learning. The core idea of these models is to jointly estimate a low-rank graph with soft labels and a latent subspace. The proposed scheme leverages the synergy between the graph structure and the data representation in terms of soft labels and latent features. This improves the monitoring information and leads to better discriminative linear transformation. Several experiments were conducted on five image datasets using state-of-the-art methods. These experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The issue of harnessing machine learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction of adverse medical events is important considering the prevalence of vast repositories of patient-level medical data, and the quest to reduce healthcare costs while elevating the quality of care. Of particular interest is identifying a set of features that can better predict the risk of unplanned readmissions of chronically ill patients within 30 days post discharge, among them patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). While numerous studies have employed ML algorithms to identify sets of significant features, only a handful have compared features extracted by various methods, and even fewer have compared the predictive power of feature sets selected by human experts to those selected by ML. Hence, this research aimed to elicit a comprehensive feature set selected by four ML algorithms and compare its predictive performance to that of a feature set selected by experts. We then evaluated a merged list of the two feature sets, constructing a human-machine collaborative set to predict the likelihood of 30-day unplanned readmission of CHF patients using data on 10,763 CHF patients hospitalized during the years 2010-2017. Our models achieved Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) above 0.8 and an Accuracy of similar to 0.89, comparable to the best models in the extant literature. Moreover, the Human-Machine Collaborative model significantly outperformed (best AUC 0.836) other human-only selected models as well as the machine-selected set. This study contributes to a better understanding of the power of using ML for patient risk stratification with special attention to the benefits of human-machine collaboration, even when these two entities work separately or in parallel, for improved clinical decision making.

AB The number of reliable samples obtained in early decision-making activity is usually relatively small. Due to variable distribution and incomplete structure of tiny datasets, it is challenging to create reliable and robust predictive modeling using classic statistical and machine learning models in small sample settings. The virtual sample generation (VSG) technique improves model learning accuracies for minimal datasets across diverse applications. Virtual samples on independent variables were generated using established VSG methods predi-cated on the assumption of a probability distribution or a membership function to fill data gaps. However, in the actual world, non-linear function interactions between variables are common. To address this issue, this paper developed a novel VSG method called Dual-VSG, which generates non-linear interpolation virtual samples using a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to improve learning performance on small datasets. We generated non-linear interpolation virtual samples without labels by estimating non-linear functions and transforming them into a high-dimensional space using the proposed dual-net model. The weights of the dual-net model are transferred to a downstream task to generate virtual sample labels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy, this research employed five datasets. On the Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) predictive model, we compared the suggested method's prediction performance to two state-of-the-art VSG approaches. To assess prediction performance on a regression dataset, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used. Furthermore, the classification accuracy (ACC) and the Fl measure are used to assess classification capability on classification datasets. In addition, the paired t-test was utilized to see if the suggested Dual-VSG approach differed significantly from the other VSG methods in terms of RMSE, MAPE, accuracy (ACC), or F1 score. For short datasets, the suggested Dual-VSG method out-performs those VSG methods, according to our experimental results.

AB Jointly extracting entities and their relations from texts is an important task in information extraction. Despite the great success, traditional models suffer from two problems. First, the same token embeddings are shared in two subtasks. It ignores the difference between semantic granularities, in which named entities are more dependent on local features and relations are semantic expressions relevant a whole sentence. Second, the interaction between two subtasks is rarely considered, which is important to encode semantic dependencies relevant to two named entities. To address the above problems, we presents a novel joint entity and relation extraction model. It constructs two independent token embedding modules for encoding features about entities and relations respectively. It enables to encode semantic representations with different granularities for named entities and entity relations. Then, a cross-attention is used to capture the interaction between two subtasks for learning semantic dependencies in a relation instance. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-art models on several public datasets. Extensive additional experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our model.

AB Deep feature search has transpired as a sub-problem of large-scale Reverse Image Retrieval (RIR) algorithms in computer vision. In light of recent progress, transforming deep features into binary codes and employing various search strategies to delineate similar images has gained popularity. However, these binary codes cannot accurately define the similarity between two images, which is essential for image retrieval. Moreover, when retrieving k closest images, the existing RIR approaches show a drop in precision value as k increases. In this paper, we put forward a method, Deep Learning based Improved Reverse Image Retrieval (DLIRIR), which solves the RIR problem by utilizing a deep neural network, clustering methodology, and dimensionality reduction technique. Motivated by the need to prevent information loss in converting deep features to binary codes and reduce search time, we cluster image features and select some features from each cluster called Representative Points (RPs). These RPs are then compared to features of an image (query) to retrieve images similar to it from the database. The Euclidean distances of the query feature and the RPs indicate similarity between the query and the cluster of images represented by that RP. We reduce the number of comparisons by selecting as few RPs as possible. We evaluate the performance of DLIRIR by comparing it with other stateof-the-art algorithms in the RIR domain. Our method achieves a precision greater than 99% in benchmark datasets Caltech 256, Corel 10k, and Adaptiope, while a precision between 80%-85% on large size datasets Cifar 100, Tiny ImageNet, and VGGFace2.

AB Density peaks clustering (DPC), which is short for clustering by fast search-and-find of density peaks, is a recently developed density-based clustering method that is widely used because of its effective detection of isolated high-density regions. However, it often fails to identify true cluster structures from data owing to its intrinsic assumption that a cluster has a unique and high-density center, because a single cluster can contain several peaks. We call this the "multi-peak problem". To overcome this, we propose a peak merging method for clustering. In the proposed algorithm, a valley and its local density are defined to identify the intersection between two adjoined peaks. These are used to construct directed and connected subgraphs, using which we merge multiple peaks if needed. Unlike DPC and its variants, the proposed method is capable of identifying highly complex shaped clusters with no interpretation of the decision graph. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that our method outperformed the benchmarking methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a new shopping paradigm, live streaming e-commerce has undergone rapid development in recent years. However, a higher return rate than that of traditional e-commerce not only affects the consumption experience of users but also is detrimental to the development of the entire industry. Previous studies on product returns have mainly focused on traditional e-commerce, with few studies considering signals in unstructured data formats. The main contribution of our research is the design of a multimodal analytics framework to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce settings. Multimodal features (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) and their correlations extracted from different data sources (product descriptions and live streaming records) are considered in our prediction model. In addition, to better study the impact of anchor speech during live streaming, we propose an acoustic feature extraction model called "OpenTransformer," which extracts acoustic features of anchor audio and outperforms baselines. We have conducted experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from Taobao live streaming. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multimodal signals from products and anchors for product return prediction. The managerial implications of our research are that live streaming platforms and potential consumers can prejudge which sold products will have high return rates in a timely fashion, and based on these predictions, merchants and anchors can better design their product descriptions and speech behaviors. This study thus supports more effective development of live streaming e-commerce markets.

ID GRANULATION
AB As combinations of neighborhood rough sets and multigranulation rough sets (MRSs), optimistic and pessimistic neighborhood MRSs can handle complex information systems and characterize problems from multiple perspectives. Nevertheless, they require complete inclusion between neighborhood granules and target concepts, which may weaken their fault tolerance. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes neighborhood MRSs based on variable precision neighborhood (VMRSs), which allow a certain degree of misclassification and noise in data. In VMRSs, we assign different weights to different attribute subsets to distinguish their importance in learning. In addition to investigating the properties of the VMRS model, we focus on the methods of obtaining its required multiple attribute subsets and their weights. Next, we introduce two applications of the VMRS model. One is using it to construct an indicator for evaluating attribute clustering and attribute subset weighting methods. The other is employing it for attribute reduction. Based on distribution distances, we develop a heuristic algorithm framework for obtaining the proposed reducts. The mechanism and applications of VMRSs are explained through a case study on a medical diagnosis issue. Finally, the experiments on real datasets illuminate the effectiveness and superiority of the methods and algorithms in the paper.

AB In this article, we address the issues of stability and data-efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL). A novel RL approach, Kullback-Leibler divergence-regularized distributional RL (KL-C51) is proposed to integrate the advantages of both stability in the distributional RL and data-efficiency in the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-regularized RL in one framework. KL-C51 derived the Bellman equation and the TD errors regularized by KL divergence in a distributional perspective and explored the approximated strategies of properly mapping the corresponding Boltzmann softmax term into distributions. Evaluated not only by several benchmark tasks with different complexity from OpenAI Gym but also by six Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, the proposed method clearly illustrates the positive effect of the KL divergence regularization to the distributional RL including exclusive exploration behaviors and smooth value function update, and demonstrates an improvement in both learning stability and data-efficiency compared with other related baseline approaches.

AB Searching for quantitative scientific prediction models and methods under uncertain hybrid information environment is helpful to the scientific decision-making of practical management problems. In this paper, we discuss the uncertain decision making problem with hybrid attributes and fuzzy decision objects. Considering the characteristic of hybrid attribute information, we introduce kernel functions to abstract the similarities from different types of attributes. On this basis, the kernel-based upper and lower approximations of arbitrary fuzzy decision objects over hybrid attribute information system are given under a multi-granularity framework, i.e., kernelized multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets, called KMGFRS in this paper. Then, the attribute reduction on hybrid attribute decision system based on KMGFRS is discussed. In addition, we combine KMGFRS and fuzzy k-nearest neighbors (FkNN) to propose a new prediction method without prior information and apply it to stroke risk assessment and prediction in clinical decision-making. Finally, we use real clinical data and UCI datasets for experiment analysis, and the results verify the applicability and validity of the model.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Multi-class crop pest detection in massive images is a practically challenging problem. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) based approaches have shown promise in detecting crop pests, but there are still significant obstacles to overcome. Two primary challenges include the highly similar physical appearance of some categories, making it difficult to distinguish the specific categories manually, and the multi-scale characteristics of pest objects, leading to numerous false negative detections, especially for small pests. To address the above problems, we propose a one-stage anchor-free detection network (OSAF-Net) with strong performance and robustness. Firstly, a dynamic training sample selection (DTSS) method is devised to capture high-quality training examples that contain multi-scale contextual information to improve the detection performance of pests with diverse scales. Secondly, to mitigate the disturbance from the similar physical appearance of pests, a dynamic detection head (DDH) is introduced to accurately obtain more representative semantic features to locate and distinguish pest objects. The proposed DTSS and DDH methods are stable for implementation. They can be combined with existing state-of-the-art detection network architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets, CropPest24 and MPD2018, demonstrate that our proposed method has a competitive performance, achieving AP(50) of 77.3% on CropPest24 and 81.3% on MPD2018.

AB Online supervised learning from fast-evolving data streams, particularly in domains such as health, the environment, and manufacturing, is a crucial research area. However, these domains often experience class imbalance, which can skew class distributions. It is essential for online learning algorithms to analyze large datasets in real-time while accurately modeling rare or infrequent classes that may appear in bursts. While methods have been proposed to handle binary class imbalance, there is a lack of attention to multi-class imbalanced settings with varying degrees of imbalance in evolving streams. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Queues (DynaQ) algorithm for online learning in multi-class imbalanced settings to fill this knowledge gap. Our approach utilizes a batch-based resampling method that creates an instance queue for each class to balance the number of instances. We maintain a queue threshold and remove older samples during training. Additionally, we dynamically oversample minority classes based on one of four rate parameters: recall, F1-score, ?m, and Euclidean distance. Our learning algorithm consists of an ensemble that uses sliding windows and a soft voting schema while incorporating a drift detection mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the DynaQ approach over state-of-the-art methods.

AB Over the last decade, neural networks have reached almost every field of science and become a crucial part of various real world applications. Due to the increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions has become more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver certainty estimates or suffer from over- or under-confidence, i.e. are badly calibrated. To overcome this, many researchers have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural network's prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty have been identified and various approaches to measure and quantify uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction, without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. For that, a comprehensive introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their separation into reducible model uncertainty and irreducible data uncertainty is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural networks, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), ensemble of neural networks, and test-time data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for calibrating neural networks, and give an overview of existing baselines and available implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in the fields of medical image analysis, robotics, and earth observation give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding uncertainties in the practical applications of neural networks. Additionally, the practical limitations of uncertainty quantification methods in neural networks for mission- and safety-critical real world applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader usage of such methods is given.

DE feature extraction; image processing; object detection
AB The vision Transformer structure performs better in salient object detection than the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach. Vision Transformer predicts saliency by modelling long-range dependencies from sequence to sequence with convolution-free. It is challenging to distinguish the salient objects' location and obtain structural details for the influence of extracting irrelevant contextual information. A novel saliency sparse Transformer network is proposed to exploit sparse attention to guide saliency prediction. The convolution-like with dilation in the token to token (T2T) module is replaced to achieve relationships in larger regions and to improve contextual information fusion. An adaptive position bias module is designed for the Vision Transformer to make position bias suitable for variable-sized RGB images. A saliency sparse Transformer module is designed to improve the concentration of attention on the global context by selecting the Top-k of the most relevant segments to improve the detection results further. Besides, cross-modality to exploit the complementary RGB and depth modality fusion module (CMF) is used to take advantage of the complementary RGB image features and spatial depth information to enhance the feature fusion performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate this method's effectiveness and superiority that it is suitable for saliency prediction comparable to state-of-the-art RGB and RGB-D saliency methods.

AB Chest x-rays (CXRs) are broadly used in clinical practice to diagnose pulmonary diseases. Developing reliable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to automate the interpretation of CXRs can save medical practitioners time and improve diagnosis accuracy. Besides, segmenting lungs accurately plays a vital role in CAD systems. However, several challenges hamper the generalizability of current automatic lung segmentation approaches. These include the high varied shape and scale of lungs, the device-specific artifacts in CXRs, and the false positive generation. This study aims to address these issues by proposing a new attention-gated residual deep convolutional network based on an enhanced DeepLabV3 + network. The novel sophistications proposed promote the effective learning of intrinsic lung-related features to improve the network robustness against device-specific artifacts and false positive generation. In the encoder, the proposed framework leverages the attention gate mechanism to selectively filter irrelevant lower-level features using high-level multiscale features learned by the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. This improves the network adaptability to different scale and shape lungs and reduces its bias to device-specific artifacts. In the decoder, residual convolutions are used to prevent significant information loss during the segmentation map composition. Several models based on the proposed approach are built by employing the EfficientNetB4 and ResNet50 pretrained models as feature extractors and using different public datasets for training and evaluation. Empirical results demonstrated the proposed framework superiority over many state-of-the-art models by achieving 98.03% for the dice coefficient and 96.14% for the Jaccard index without applying any preprocessing or post-processing.

AB The hunger games search (HGS) algorithm is designed to tackle optimization problems, however, issues such as local minimum stagnation and immature convergence hinder its effectiveness. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel improved HGS (Imp-HGS) algorithm. The Imp-HGS algorithm uses pattern search (PS) and elite opposition-based learning (OBL) mechanisms to enhance exploitation and exploration, respectively. The algorithm's performance is tested across the CEC2019 and CECE2020 test suites along with three different engineering design problems, including identifying an infinite impulse response (IIR) model, training a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and designing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine system. The test functions demonstrated superior performance of the Imp-HGS algorithm over a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms. The ablation tests using CEC2020 test suite also demonstrate the wisely integration of the PS and elite OBL mechanisms as significant improvements are achieved. The statistical results demonstrate the significance of Imp-HGS in the IIR system identification as it consistently achieved lower average errors, lower standard deviations, competitive best results, and satisfactory worst results compared to the other algorithms. Moreover, the Imp-HGS algorithm consistently demonstrates better performance in terms of average classification rates across various datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in solving classification problems, making it a good tool for MLP training. Lastly, the Imp-HGS algorithm's ability to eliminate overshoot, achieve faster rise time, shorter settling time, and minimal peak time showcases its effectiveness in achieving stable and efficient operation of the wind turbine system. The computational times also confirm the efficacy of the Imp-HGS algorithm for all considered real-world engineering problems. Overall, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed other competitive approaches, cementing its status as a highly promising tool for tackling a wide range of complex engineering optimization problems.

AB Energy consumption of residential buildings is rising rapidly with population growth and increased utilization of electrical appliances. So far, accurate energy forecasting is an effective tool for managing energy and reducing energy wastage in residential buildings. Advanced energy forecasting techniques can handle non-linear energy consumption patterns and trends. Although, the existing forecasting approaches suffer from certain deficiencies that need to be addressed to optimize the predictive performance. In this paper, firstly, a deep learning-based bidirectional long short-term memory model is developed to predict the electricity demand of individual home appliances. Secondly, genetic algorithm has been deployed for the hyperparameter optimization of the proposed deep learning model. Further, the hybrid prediction and optimization approach is evaluated using two benchmark datasets of individual appliances' energy consumption. The experimental results revealed that the proposed hybrid approach improved the accuracy by reducing error rates for both datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art prediction models. The proposed approach can potentially optimize home appliances' energy consumption by providing consumer awareness about their usage patterns.

AB This research work projects a novel quasi-oppositional chaotic student psychology-based optimization (SPBO) (QOCSPBO) algorithm for solving global optimization problems. To tackle the identified flaws of the standard SPBO, the proffered QOCSPBO algorithm combines two search strategies within the standard SPBO framework. The obtained outcomes exhibit that the proposed QOCSPBO algorithm outperforms SPBO and recently published algorithms in optimizing a set of well-known benchmark test functions. The projected QOCSPBO attains the optimal site and size of distributed generation and shunt capacitors in two radial distribution systems contemplating different types load models at three load levels. The obtained results prove that the recommended method can be highly suitable in solving real-time power system optimization problems with constrained and unknown search space.

AB In recent years, the concept of reading people's minds while performing specific tasks has grown in popularity, especially in the field of brain-computer interface systems. The goal of this research is to offer a new comprehensive framework for visual image classification utilizing EEG signals. Here, LSTM network is chosen to extract the feature of the EEG signal. To improve the classification accuracy in comparison to recent works in this field, a ResNet is used to extract the feature from the images, and a fuzzy regression is used to map the features extracted from the images on the features extracted from the EEG signal. Because medical data usually have uncertainty and ambiguity, and the number of data samples is small, in this research, interval type-2 fuzzy regression is used. This study makes use of data from Stanford University. Classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are the measures used to evaluate outcomes. In this case, the LSTM network is able to classify images based on EEG signals with 55.55% accuracy and 55.73% precision. The findings of utilizing ResNet and interval type-2 fuzzy regression suggest that regression can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Classification accuracy and precision obtained with interval type-2 fuzzy regression and SVM classifier are 66.67% and 66.66%, respectively, for all participants. These results outperform classification accuracy and precision obtained using type-1 fuzzy, neural network and polynomial regression. In addition, the mean accuracy for all participants obtained in this article is 4.09% greater than the best result reported in a previous article using the same database. This leads to the conclusion that fuzzy regression, especially interval type-2 fuzzy regression, performs better in high uncertainty environments. Therefore, it is concluded that the method proposed in this research can be used for decoding brain response to visual image stimuli and classifying the stimulus images with acceptable accuracy, thereby advancing the goal of mind reading.

AB Design/methodology/approach: Converting data into information and its diffusion along all organization units has become a vital survival skill. At this point, an ERP system provides an invisible network among a company's internal and external stakeholders and plays a strategic role. Moreover, ERP systems offer some advantages. For example, integrating financial, customer, and order information, speeding up production processes, and reducing stock level and order lead time. Therefore, we propose an integrated spherical fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and spherical fuzzy-combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) framework to prioritize the best ERP software provider for the defense industry.
   Purpose: Despite having the advantages mentioned above, some crucial aspects must be considered while selecting an ERP package. Factors such as high cost, difficulty in installation, and security threats can be very challenging. The latter issue needs special care in the defense industry. This study aims to design an evaluation framework for the ERP selection problem in the sector.
   Findings: One of the pivoting defense companies in Turkey is chosen as a case study. Seven ERP systems are evaluated with the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can be successfully implemented in a defense company context. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis proves the robustness of the approach to varying threshold parameters in CODAS and different fuzzy weighting approaches.
   Originality/value: The defense professionals prioritize a different set of selection criteria than conventional manufacturing firms. The study provides a rare holistic framework for the defense industry using a hybridized SF-AHP-CODAS technique. Thus, the study may serve as reference work for the researchers and decision-makers during the digitalization journey of defense firms.

AB Recent advances in Internet technology have shifted the focus of end-users from the usage of traditional mobile applications to the Internet of Things (IoT)-based service-oriented smart applications (SAs). These SAs use edge devices to obtain different types of Fog services and provide their real-time response to the end-users. The Fog computing environment extends its services to the edge network layer and hosts SAs that require low latency. Further, a growing number of latency-aware SAs imposes the issue of effective allocation of resources in the Fog environment. In this paper, we have proposed an effective multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based solution for resource ranking and resource allocation in the Fog environment. The Proposed algorithms implement the modified edition of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and consider Quality of Experience parameters (QoE), i.e., network bandwidth, average latency, and cores for ranking and mapping of resources. The obtained results reveal that the proposed approach utilizes 70% resources, and reduces the response time by an average of 7.5s as compared to the Cloud model and the Fog model, respectively. Similarly, the completion time of the proposed framework is minimum in comparison with the cloud and Fog models with a difference of 9s and 16s.

TI ContextAD: Context-Aware Acronym Disambiguation with Siamese BERT
   Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Acronym disambiguation is the process of determining the correct expansion of an acronym in given context, which can assist many downstream natural language processing tasks. Typically, existing methods on this task will directly perform semantic comparisons between the candidate expansions and the original sentence, ignoring the relevance of contextual information to expansions. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a context-aware acronym disambiguation method with Siamese BERT network (ContextAD). First, we combine each candidate expansion with corresponding acronym's context to form a new sentence set. Then, the new and original sentences are input into a Siamese BERT network that can obtain the semantic similarity. The new sentences and the separate candidate expansions are input into the Siamese BERT network, respectively, along with the original sentences, which can obtain another semantic similarity. Finally, the two different semantic similarities are combined to determine the most suitable expansion. We quantify the improvement of our proposed ContextAD model against a state-of-the-art baseline using the public dataset of the shared tasks of acronym disambiguation (AD) held under AAAI-2021 workshop on SDU and show that it achieves a better performance based on the same BERT model.

AB At present, medical image classification algorithm plays an important role in clinical diagnosis. However, due to the scarcity of data labels, small sample size, uneven distribution, and poor domain generalization, many algorithms still have limitations. Therefore, a deep learning training network for disease classification and recognition of multimodal few-shot medical images are proposed, trying to solve the above problems and limitations. The network is based on the idea of meta-learning for training. Specifically, the technology of transfer learning and few-shot learning are used. In the process of building and improving the network structure, the multi-source domain generalization method, which performs well in the field of person re-identification, is combined. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the model are verified by using Grad-CAM tool. The experiments show that the accuracy of classification and recognition of the model is better than the advanced model in this field. The concerned areas of model classification are similar or the same as the manually labelled areas. It is of far-reaching significance to improve the efficiency of future clinical auxiliary diagnosis and patient diversion, as well as to promote the development of the Wise Information Technology of Med in the future.

DE Near-duplicate detection; news articles; explainability; BERT; SHAP
AB The focus of this work is detecting semantically similar news articles for search engines and recommender systems which is an important step towards processing and understanding natural language. Search engines and recommender systems typically filter out near-duplicate articles which are often just a paraphrasing of a previous article and therefore irrelevant for the users. Articles with a high level of overlapping content are not interesting to the reader and should be avoided. Here, we focus on named entities, such as people, organizations and places, and their role as a key feature for identifying near-duplicate articles. Since our dataset from the energy business contains a significant amount of paraphrased articles, standard techniques, e.g. based on the Jaccard coefficient, already serve quite well. A fine-tuned BERT model evaluated on named entities achieves best model results with more than 97% accuracy and highest True Positive Rates. The importance of individual words for the model decisions is evaluated by computing their Shapley values. It was found that the explanations are in overall good agreement with the human intuitive interpretation.

AB Bug localization techniques aim to locate the relevant buggy source files according to the bug described by the given bug report, so as to improve the localization efficiency of developers and reduce the cost of software maintenance. The traditional bug localization techniques based on Information Retrieval (IR) usually use the classical text retrieval model and combines the specific domain knowledge features in software engineering to locate the bugs. However, there exists the vocabulary mismatch problem between the bug report and the source file, which may affect the performance of bug localization. Therefore, the relevant deep learning model was introduced later to compute the similarity between the bug report and the source file from the perspective of semantic features. Bug localization approaches based on IR and deep learning have their own advantages and disadvantages, so this paper proposes a model named LocFront which combines IR and deep learning. On the one hand, the Features Crossing module in LocFront carries out the deep crossing operation on the extracted software-specific features to fully acquire the linear and nonlinear relationships. On the other hand, the Structured Semantic Information Matching module in LocFront performs semantic matching on the structured information between the bug report and the source file. Then the Fusion module in LocFront fuses the results of the two above modules to obtain the final localization score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that LocFront outperforms the state-of-the-art bug localization approaches.

TI A Combined Usage of NLP Libraries Towards Analyzing Software Documents

DE Natural language processing; NLP library selection; software document
AB Software documents are commonly processed by natural language processing (NLP) libraries to extract information. The libraries provide similar functional APIs to achieve NLP tasks, numerous toolkits result in a problem of selection. In this work, we propose a method to combine the strengths of different NLP libraries to avoid the subjective selection of a specific NLP library. The combined usage is conducted through two steps, i.e. document-level selection of primary NLP library and sentence-level overwriting. The primary NLP library is determined according to the overlap degree of the results. The highest overlap degree indicated the most effective NLP library on a specific NLP task. Through sentence-level overwriting, the possible fine-gained improvements from other libraries are extracted to overwrite the outputs of primary library. We evaluate the combined method with six widely used NLP libraries and 200 documents from three different sources. The results show that the combined method can generally outperform all the studied NLP libraries in terms of accuracy. The finding means that our combined method can be used instead of individual NLP library for more effective results.

AB Recent works on deriving interpretability of machine learning models have focused on post-hoc explanations, and it is believed that there is a trade-off between explainability and model complexity. Apart from this framework, Self-Explaining Neural Network (SENN) has been proposed, which is a neural network version of the linear model aiming to achieve both explainability and model complexity. However, this model does not consider the relationship between the concepts inherent in the data and the explaining parameters that determine how important the corresponding concepts are. Additionally, the method proposed to extract concept representatives in SENN is ambiguous, and the concepts are not easily distinguishable. By focusing more on interpretability, we improved this model by (i) making the inherent concepts disentangled using the Wasserstein variant of the total correlation so that the concepts are more transparent to users, (ii) introducing new activation functions and regularization to ensure that the inherent concepts and explaining parameters play their roles properly and give validity to the method of choosing representatives, and (iii) experimentally showing that the choice of activation functions is important when training the SENN.

ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; USER
AB Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most widely employed methodologies for recommender systems, has drawn undeniable attention due to its effectiveness and simplicity. Nevertheless, a few papers have been published on the CF-based item-based model using similarity measures than the user-based model due to the model's complexity and the time required to build it. Additionally, the substantial shortcomings in the user-based measurements when the item-based model is taken into account motivated us to create stronger models in this work. Not to mention that the common trickiest challenge is dealing with the cold-start problem, in which users' history of item-buying behavior is missing (i.e., new users) or items for which activity is not provided (i.e., new items). Therefore, our novel five similarity measures, which have the potential to solve sparse data, are developed to alleviate the impact of this important problem. Most importantly, a thorough empirical analysis of how the item-based model affects the CF-based recommendation system's performance has also been a critical part of this work, which presents a benchmarking study for thirty similarity metrics. The MAE, MSE, and accuracy metrics, together with fivefold cross-validation, are used to properly assess and examine the influence of all considered similarity measures using the Movie-lens 100 K and Film Trust datasets. The findings demonstrate how competitive the proposed similarity measures are in comparison to their alternatives. Surprisingly, some of the top "state-of-the-art" performers (such as SMD and NHSM) have been unable to fiercely compete with our proposed rivals when utilizing the item-based model.

DE Depth estimation; Geometry-aware constraint; Relative order
AB Monocular depth estimation, which is playing an increasingly important role in 3D scene understanding, has been attracting increasing attention in the computer vision field in recent years. The latest monocular depth estimation methods based on deep learning have achieved significant performance by exploring various network architectures. However, compared with designing larger and more complex model architectures for monocular depth estimation, leveraging scene geometry relations to boost the performance of monocular depth estimation models has been less studied. To explore further utilization of scene geometry relations on monocular depth estimation, we propose a geometry-aware constraint that makes use of relative order information to improve the performance of monocular depth estimation models. Specifically, we first design a relative order descriptor (ROD) to construct the relative order description on single scene location. Then, based on the ROD, the relative order map (ROM) is built to represent the relative order information of the whole scene. Finally, a loss term relative order loss (ROL), which relies on ROM to supervise the training process of the monocular depth estimation model is presented. Our proposed method can help monocular depth estimation models to predict more accurate depth maps. Moreover, with the geometry constraint from our method, the monocular depth estimation model can provide prediction results where high-quality scene structure can be better preserved. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular datasets NYU Depth V2 and KITTI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Automatic incident detection not only plays an important role in traffic safety management, but also contributes to the operation of intelligent transportation systems. Although the emerging information technologies and artificial intelligence approaches are paving the way for high-precision incident detection, existing incident detection methods fail to handle the unbalanced incident data with excessive zero observations. Also, issues related to network delays and privacy leakage of centralized computing are prevalent. To fill the above gaps, this study proposes a novel automatic incident detection paradigm using an edge-cloud collaboration mechanism. In particular, a Spatio-Temporal Variational Digraph Auto-Encoder model is developed to distinguish the incidents in dynamic traffic flows. To be specific, the model encoder includes two components. The first module, deployed in an edge server, is designed to extract the local contexts from the real-time traffic flow. The dynamic traffic flows will be projected into a spatio-temporal digraph, and in turn addressed by a graph convolutional network for extraction of the deep-seated features. Similarly, the second module is deployed in a central server to capture the spatio-temporal global contexts from historical traffic flows. Finally, the above-concerned contexts are integrated and fed into a model decoder to measure the likelihood of incidents. To testify the proposed paradigm and model, real-world datasets were applied. The experimental results revealed the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of detection accuracy, achieving 26.3% improvement over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm is more efficient in respondence compared with traditional centralized computing, realizing 8x processing speed for the same detection task.

AB Epilepsy is considered as a serious brain disorder in which patients frequently experience seizures. The seizures are defined as the unexpected electrical changes in brain neural activity, which leads to unconsciousness. Existing researches made an intense effort for predicting the epileptic seizures using brain signal data. However, they faced difficulty in obtaining the patients' characteristics because the model's distribution turned to fake predictions, affecting the model's reliability. In addition, the existing prediction models have severe issues, such as overfitting and false positive rates. To overcome these existing issues, we propose a deep learning approach known as Deep dual-patch attention mechanism (D(2)PAM) for classifying the pre-ictal signals of people with Epilepsy based on the brain signals. Deep neural network is integrated with D(2)PAM, and it lowers the effect of differences between patients to predict ES. The multi-network design enhances the trained model's generalisability and stability efficiently. Also, the proposed model for processing the brain signal is designed to transform the signals into data blocks, which is appropriate for pre-ictal classification. The earlier warning of epilepsy with the proposed model obtains the auxiliary diagnosis. The data of real patients for the experiments provides the improved accuracy by D(2)PAM approximation compared to the existing techniques. To be more distinctive, the authors have analysed the performance of their work with five patients, and the accuracy comes out to be 95%, 97%, 99%, 99%, and 99% respectively. Overall, the numerical results unveil that the proposed work outperforms the existing models.

AB In various situations requiring empirical model building from highly multivariate measurements, modelling based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) may often provide efficient low-dimensional model solutions. In unsupervised situations, the same may be true for principal component analysis (PCA). In both cases, however, it is also of interest to identify subsets of the measured variables useful for obtaining sparser but still comparable models without significant loss of information and performance. In the present paper, we propose a voting approach for sparse overall maximisation of variance analogous to PCA and a similar alternative for deriving sparse regression models influenced closely related to the PLSR method. Both cases yield pivoting strategies for a modified Gram-Schmidt process and its corresponding (partial) QR-factorisation of the underlying data matrix to manage the variable selection process. The proposed methods include score and loading plot possibilities that are acknowledged for providing efficient interpretations of the related PCA and PLS models in chemometric applications.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Human pose estimation; human pose completion; movies; generative

AB Many actual images contain partial body camera shots, in which a significant part of the body is not visible. This issue is especially prevalent in film images, where less than 10% are full-body shots. Most 2D human pose estimation methods return incomplete poses when applied to partial body images. This lack of completeness becomes a problem in some situations, for example, when the 2D pose is converted to a 3D pose by a two-stage 3D human pose estimation method since most of these methods require a complete pose to work. This article proposes a new technique, called CompletePose, consisting of completing the missing keypoints when 2D human pose estimation methods are applied to images with partial body camera shots. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network is used to obtain a complete and plausible pose, realistic enough to predict a 3D pose with a two-stage 3D human pose estimation method. A complete empirical validation has been carried out with the Human3.6 M dataset and a new dataset, called CHARADE, specially built and made public for reproducibility and benchmarking for this research. Quantitative evaluation employing the Frechet distance shows that the approach manages to approximate the actual data distribution. The qualitative evaluation shows that the completed poses enable obtaining plausible 3D poses from images previously intractable.

AB The wireless sensor nodes of the network gather environmental data while using their batteries to communicate with the base station. When sharing data, the sensor nodes consume more energy, which shortens the network lifetime. Energy efficiency is a crucial factor to think about while building sensor networks. The clustering technique's main goal is to carry out the most energy-efficient data transmission possible while simultaneously increasing the network's useful life. The optimal cluster head selection in sustainable wireless communication systems is proposed in this research to find the best cluster head selection for the enhanced deep neural network approach. The cluster heads are best located using this technique, which also improves the firefly's general search activity. Throughput, energy left over, and the number of active nodes are measured when evaluating the suggested methodology. The findings indicate a rise in network longevity, which boosts the quantity of active nodes and lowers energy consumption. Through comparison, it was found that the proposed methodology beats the firefly algorithm in terms of throughput and leftover energy.

AB Cyber-attacks and network intrusion have surfaced as major concerns for modern days applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). The existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques have a wide range of limitations and thus are unable to precisely detect any type of attack or anomaly within the network traffic. Many machine learning-based algorithms have also been presented by the researchers, which lack performance in terms of classification accuracy, or in terms of multi-class classification. This research presents a data-driven approach for intrusion and anomaly detection, where the data is processed and filtered using different algorithms. The quality of the training dataset is improved by using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm and mutual information. Automated machine learning is also used to detect the algorithm with auto-tuned hyper-parameters that best suit to classify the data. This technique not only saves the computational cost to test the data at run-time but also provides an optimal algorithm without the need to run calculations to tune hyper-parameters, manually. The resultant algorithm solves a multi-class classification problem with an accuracy of 99.7%, outperforming the existing algorithms by a decent margin.

AB In this research, a novel approach is applied to obtain the solution for the non-homogeneous system of fuzzy fractional differential equations. The fuzzy fractional initial value problem is split into sets of classical fractional initial value problems. Such a fractional initial value problem is constructed by taking the forcing term derived from each of fuzzy set and the initial value obtained from each of fuzzy intervals. The solution to the fuzzy fractional initial value problem is defined as the collection of all solutions of the classical fractional initial value problems, and its degree of membership is the smallest value among the degrees of membership obtained from forcing terms and initial values in the associated fuzzy sets. Specifically, a solution is constructed as a fuzzy collection of real vector functions, instead of a vector of fuzzy-valued functions. The numerical example has been used to illustrate the proposed approach in detail. The benefits of the proposed methodology over the existing methodology, as well as its applicability to the real world, are clearly demonstrated.

AB The traditional group decision-making (GDM) models do not intend to work with many alternatives. It is because experts like giving preference information based on a pairwise comparison of alternatives using preference relations. It is possible if the number of alternatives is small. If the number of alternatives is large, it is difficult for experts to give their preferred information. The current study mainly focuses on developing a new GDM model for managing many alternatives. In this model, experts like to create different groups of similar alternatives without getting lost among all available alternatives that have many alternatives without dealing with them directly. Then, we apply the hierarchical clustering method for clustering the alternatives. After that, one GDM model has spread to find the best cluster and select the final alternative using another. This paper uses Pythagorean linguistic preference relation (PLPR)-based GDM model in the two views. (1) Experts give their decision preferences comfortably instead of strict linguistic preference relations. (2) The PLPR-based GDM model is designed with consistency matrix-based group recommendations and feedback mechanism. The proposed GDM process is described with the example, which is the selection of companies of the fund manager in a mutual fund where the customers invest money for the best returns.

AB With the rapid development of China's economy, wind resource development has important practical significance for alleviating environmental pollution problems in China. As China's clean energy province and western economic center, Sichuan's wind power industry is gradually starting from the 13th Five-Year Plan. Considering the volatility and periodic characteristics of wind power generation in Sichuan Province, this paper proposes an optimized seasonal grey model based on Aquila Optimizer. The proposed model selects dummy variables 1 and 0 to represent seasonal factors and perform seasonal classification of the sample data. According to the classification sequence, this paper constructs the grey forecasting model with optimized initial and background values by Aquila Optimizer. The proposed model predicts wind power generation in Sichuan Province and verifies its validity and rationality by comparing results with other selected methods. In training and test groups, the performance results of the proposed model are better. The mean absolute percentage error is 3.44% and 12.34%, and the root mean square error is 0.86% and 4.33%. Finally, this paper further provides policy advice and planning based on the prediction results for the future development of Sichuan Province's clean energy industry during the 14th Five-Year Plan period.

TI Deep latent representation enhancement method for social recommendation
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Social recommendation; Graph neural networks; Social network;
   Representation learning
AB Social recommendation can effectively improve recommendation performance by leveraging social relationships to alleviate the sparsity of user-item interaction data. Because these connections in social recommendation can be easily represented as graph-structured data, social recommendation based on graph neural networks has received significant attention. However, existing works focus on modeling the long-term preferences of users and rarely consider the effect of temporal factors on preferences, resulting in a failure to accurately learn the representation of present preferences. Moreover, existing works mainly utilize similarity to connect different items. But items in the same category often have more connections and correlations with each other, which can be employed to enhance the learning of item representations. Therefore, this work proposes DLREM (Deep Latent Representation Enhancement Method for Social Recommendation) to address the above limitations. Specifically, DLREM exploits dual graph attention networks to learn long-term representations of users and items separately and exploits recurrent neural networks to capture the dynamic preferences of users. In addition, attention mechanisms are used to model user social relationships and item correlations, enhancing the learning of user and item representations. Combining the enhanced deep latent representations of users and items can improve the accuracy of social recommendation. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our model achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art models.

AB In this study, a novel application of the Koopman operator for control-oriented modeling of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks is proposed. The primary contributions of this paper are: (1) the design of Koopman-based models for a fuel cell stack, incorporating K-fold cross-validation, varying lifted dimensions, radial basis functions (RBFs), and prediction horizons; and (2) comparison of the performance of Koopman-based approach with a more traditional physics-based model. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the Koopman-based model in predicting fuel cell stack behavior, with an error of less than 3%. The proposed approach offers several advantages, including enhanced computational efficiency, reduced computational burden, and improved interpretability. This study demonstrates the suitability of the Koopman operator for the modeling and control of PEMFCs and provides valuable insights into a novel control-oriented modeling approach that enables accurate and efficient predictions for fuel cell stacks.

AB The principal component analysis (PCA) combining with data window (DW) strategies have been broadly investigated on feature extraction or dimensionality reduction for fault detection in building energy systems. For the real-world application, however, there still exist two big challenging tasks. One is that what size of data windows could make sense to alleviate the lag response of system operating variables to dynamic thermal loads, and the other is that how the scalable parallel benchmark datasets affect the effectiveness of identifying fault symptoms. In order to develop an effective solution for identifying fault symptom in dynamic lag-response-toload systems, our previous work has developed PCA fault detection method combing with DW and thermal load matching (LM) strategies. Few studies, however, have explored the sensitivity of scalable data from observed time-series datasets and benchmark datasets to the effectiveness of fault identification. This study unveils the sensitivity of scalable data on three kinds of fault detection methods including conventional PCA, PCA + DW and PCA + DW & LM. The DW strategy is employed to alleviate the system lag response to dynamic loads, and the LM strategy is introduced to achieve coincident and compact benchmark. The results show that large data sizes in both data widows and benchmark datasets can increase fault-free detection ratio but decrease fault detection ratio, mainly because large size of data packets potentially retain much dynamic information. Furthermore, the 600-packet and 900-packet sizes of benchmark datasets, and 10-packet, 30-packet and 60packet sizes of data windows present moderate fault-free and fault detection ratios.

TI Covid-19 epidemic and regional carbon emissions: A study based on

ID CONSUMPTION
AB The COVID-19 epidemic has had an unexpected impact on global carbon emissions. In this context, carbon emission prediction is very important for policy formulation and implementation. It is worth pondering how the grey model deals with the prediction of unexpected events. Considering the spatial dependence of carbon emissions, this paper improves the multivariate grey model, gives new information a higher reference weight, and constructs a metabolic multivariate grey model -MMGM(1,m|?) which takes new information as the priority. An optimization algorithm is constructed with the minimum error as the goal to determine the value of the weight adjustment parameter ?. Then we simulate and predict the carbon emissions of three regions: China's Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), the North American Free Trade Area (Canada, Mexico, and the US), and West Europe (the UK and France). These three cases have different regions, different numbers of behavioural variables, different degrees of influence by COVID-19, and different trends, which are comparative. The results show that the new model has a good fitting effect, and it is still applicable in dealing with unexpected events. The new model can reflect regional carbon emission changes more systematically and accurately. Finally, according to cases and discussions, we get some management enlightenment to promote regional environmental collaborative governance.

AB We study a novel reasoning task in Ontology-based Data Management (OBDM), called Abstraction, which aims at associating formal semantic descriptions to data services. In OBDM a domain ontology is used to provide a semantic layer mapped to the data sources of an organization. The basic idea of the work presented in this paper is to explain the semantics of a data service in terms of a query over the ontology. We illustrate a formal framework for this problem, based on three different notions of abstraction, called sound, complete, and perfect, respectively. We present a thorough complexity analysis of two computational problems, namely verification (checking whether a query is an abstraction of a given data service), and computation (computing an abstraction of a given data service). & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

ID ALGORITHMS; SEARCH; MINIZINC; INTEGER
AB Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs) ask for an assignment of values to variables in order to optimize an objective subject to constraints that restrict the value combinations in the assignment. They are usually solved by the classical Branch and Bound (B & B) search algorithm. Dominance breaking is an important technique in B & B to prune assignments that are subordinate to others concerning the objective value and/or the satisfiability of constraints. In practice, the addition of constraints for dominance breaking can drastically speed up the B & B search for solving many COPs. However, identification of suboptimal assignments in COPs and derivation of useful constraints for dominance breaking are usually problem-specific and require sophisticated human insights on the problem structure.This paper proposes the first theoretical and practical framework for automatic generation of dominance breaking constraints for a class of COPs consisting of efficiently checkable objectives and constraints. In particular, the framework focuses on generating nogood constraints representing incompatible value assignments and formulates nogood generation as solving auxiliary constraint satisfaction problems. The proposed method can generate nogoods of varying strengths for dominance breaking by controlling the number of involved variables. Experimentation on various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposal in both efficiency and ease of use. The superior performance is also supported by a theoretical analysis to compare the relative strength of automatically generated nogoods with manually derived dominance breaking constraints in the literature. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   CLASSIFICATION
AB Difference of Gaussians (DoG) convolutional filters are one of the earliest image processing methods employed for detecting microcalcifications on mammogram images before machine and deep learning methods became widespread. DoG is a blob enhancement filter that consists in subtracting one Gaussian-smoothed version of an image from another less Gaussian-smoothed version of the same image. Smoothing with a Gaussian kernel suppresses high-frequency spatial information, thus DoG can be regarded as a band-pass filter. However, due to their small size and overimposed breast tissue, microcalcifications vary greatly in contrast-to-noise ratio and sharpness. This makes it difficult to find a single DoG configuration that enhances all microcalcifications. In this work, we propose a convolutional network, named DoG-MCNet, where the first layer automatically learns a bank of DoG filters parameterized by their associated standard deviations. We experimentally show that when employed for microcalcification detection, our DoG layer acts as a learnable bank of band-pass preprocessing filters and improves detection performance by 4.86% AUFROC over baseline MCNet and 1.53% AUFROC over state-of-the-art multicontext ensemble of CNNs.

   processing) NLP; Sentiment classification
AB State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in the task of text classification. Despite the widespread use of deep learning-based language models, there remains much work to be done in order to improve the security of these models. This is particularly concerning for their growing use in sensitive applications, such as sentiment analysis. This study demonstrates that language models possess inherent susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks, wherein a small number of words or characters are modified to produce an adversarial text that deceives the machine into producing erroneous predictions while maintaining its true meaning for human readers. The current study offers HOMOCHAR, a novel textual adversarial attack that operates within a black box setting. The proposed method generates more robust adversarial examples by considering the task of perturbing a text input with transformations at the character level. The objective is to deceive a target NLP model while adhering to specific linguistic constraints in a way such that the perturbations are imperceptible to humans. Comprehensive experiments are performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed attack method against several popular models, including Word CNN, Word-LSTM along with five powerful transformer models on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MR & IMDB utilized for sentiment analysis task. Empirical findings indicate that the proposed attack model consistently attains significantly greater attack success rates (ASR) and generates high-quality adversarial examples when compared to conventional methods. The results indicate that text-based sentiment prediction techniques can be circumvented, leading to potential consequences for existing policy measures.

ID DEPLOYMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB Benefiting from the advanced deep learning techniques, significant achievements have been made in gen-eric object detection. Tiny object detection (TOD) is a challenging task in computer vision due to the low resolution, insufficient geometric cues, and high noise levels. A recent trend for detectors is introducing more granular label assignment strategies to provide promising supervision information for classification and regression. However, most previous Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) based methods suffer from two main drawbacks, including (1) low tolerance of IoU for bounding box deviations in tiny objects and (2) deficient guidance for optimization caused by inter-sample and intra-sample imbalance. We propose two novel components to address these problems: the Gaussian probabilistic distribution-based fuzzy similarity metric (GPM) and the adaptive dynamic anchor mining strategy (ADAS). GPM aims to address the issue of inaccurate similarity measurement between small bounding boxes and pre-defined anchors, providing a more accurate basis for label assignment. ADAS adopts a dynamically adjusted strategy for label assignment to address the distribution bias between positive and negative samples, ensuring that the label assignment is consistent with the distribution of objects in the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on AI-TODv2 and other tiny object detection datasets to evaluate the proposed ADAS-GPM method's performance. The results demonstrate that incorporating ADAS-GPM into an anchor -based object detector yields significant outperformance over state-of-the-art methods on the challenging AI-TODv2 benchmark. The proposed ADAS-GPM method exhibits good results, clearly demonstrating its validity and potential.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   theory; cycle memory network (CMN); lifelong learning
AB Learning from a sequence of tasks for a lifetime is essential for an agent toward artificial general intelligence. Despite the explosion of this research field in recent years, most work focuses on the well-known catastrophic forgetting issue. In contrast, this work aims to explore knowledge-transferable lifelong learning without storing historical data and significant additional computational overhead. We demonstrate that existing data-free frameworks, including regularization-based single-network and structure-based multinetwork frameworks, face a fundamental issue of lifelong learning, named anterograde forgetting, i.e., preserving and transferring memory may inhibit the learning of new knowledge. We attribute it to the fact that the learning network capacity decreases while memorizing historical knowledge and conceptual confusion between the irrelevant old knowledge and the current task. Inspired by the complementary learning theory in neuroscience, we endow artificial neural networks with the ability to continuously learn without forgetting while recalling historical knowledge to facilitate learning new knowledge. Specifically, this work proposes a general framework named cycle memory networks (CMNs). The CMN consists of two individual memory networks to store short- and long-term memories separately to avoid capacity shrinkage and a transfer cell between them. It enables knowledge transfer from the long-term to the short-term memory network to mitigate conceptual confusion. In addition, the memory consolidation mechanism integrates short-term knowledge into the long-term memory network for knowledge accumulation. We demonstrate that the CMN can effectively address the anterograde forgetting on several task-related, task-conflict, class-incremental, and crossdomain benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide extensive ablation studies to verify each framework component. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/CMN.

AB Resilience in autonomous agent systems is about having the capacity to anticipate, respond to, adapt to, and recover from adverse and dynamic conditions in complex environments. It is associated with the intelligence possessed by the agents to preserve the functionality or to minimize the impact on functionality through a transformation, reconfiguration, or expansion performed across the system. Enhancing the resilience of systems could pave way toward higher autonomy allowing them to tackle intricate dynamic problems. The state-of-the-art systems have mostly focussed on improving the redundancy of the system, adopting decentralized control architectures, and utilizing distributed sensing capabilities. While machine learning approaches for efficient distribution and allocation of skills and tasks have enhanced the potential of these systems, they are still limited when presented with dynamic environments. To move beyond the current limitations, this paper advocates incorporating counterfactual learning models for agents to enable them with the ability to predict possible future conditions and adjust their behavior. Counterfactual learning is a topic that has recently been gaining attention as a model-agnostic and post-hoc technique to improve explainability in machine learning models. Using counterfactual causality can also help gain insights into unforeseen circumstances and make inferences about the probability of desired outcomes. We propose that this can be used in agent systems as a means to guide and prepare them to cope with unanticipated environmental conditions. This supplementary support for adaptation can enable the design of more intelligent and complex autonomous agent systems to address the multifaceted characteristics of real-world problem domains.

AB ObjectiveThis study aims to develop and compare different models to predict the Length of Stay (LoS) and the Prolonged Length of Stay (PLoS) of inpatients admitted through the emergency department (ED) in general patient settings. This aim is not only to promote any specific model but rather to suggest a decision-supporting tool (i.e., a prediction framework). MethodsWe analyzed a dataset of patients admitted through the ED to the "Sant"Orsola Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy, between January 1 and October 26, 2022. PLoS was defined as any hospitalization with LoS longer than 6 days. We deployed six classification algorithms for predicting PLoS: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression (LoR). We evaluated the performance of these models with the Brier score, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F1-score. We further developed eight regression models for LoS prediction: Linear Regression (LR), including the penalized linear models Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge and Elastic-net regression, Support vector regression, RF regression, KNN, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression. The model performances were measured by their mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean relative error. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). ResultsA total of 12,858 eligible patients were included in our study, of whom 60.88% had a PloS. The GB classifier best predicted PloS (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.4%, Brier score 0.181), followed by LoR classifier (accuracy 75%, AUC 75.2%, Brier score 0.182). These models also showed to be adequately calibrated. Ridge and XGBoost regressions best predicted LoS, with the smallest total prediction error. The overall prediction error is between 6 and 7 days, meaning there is a 6-7 day mean difference between actual and predicted LoS. ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based methods to predict LoS and provide valuable insights into the risks behind prolonged hospitalizations. In addition to physicians' clinical expertise, the results of these models can be utilized as input to make informed decisions, such as predicting hospitalizations and enhancing the overall performance of a public healthcare system.

AB In the field of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), vehicle recognition is a hot research topic. Although different types of vehicles can already be recognized, further identification and statistics of new energy and fuel vehicles in unknown and complex environments remain a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a New Energy Vehicle Recognition and Traffic Flow Statistics (NEVTS) approach. Specifically, we first utilized the You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5) algorithm to detect vehicles in the target area, in which we applied Task-Specific Context Decoupling (TSCODE) to decouple the prediction and classification tasks of YOLOv5. This approach significantly enhanced the performance of vehicle detection. Then, track them upon detection. Finally, we use the YOLOv5 algorithm to locate and classify the color of license plates. Green license plates indicate new energy vehicles, while non-green license plates indicate fuel vehicles, which can accurately and efficiently calculate the number of new energy vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed NEVTS in recognizing new energy vehicles and traffic flow statistics is demonstrated by experimental results. Not only can NEVTS be applied to the recognition of new energy vehicles and traffic flow statistics, but it can also be further employed for traffic timing pattern extraction and traffic situation monitoring and management.

ID PREDICTION; MODEL
AB Millions of residents travel by urban rail transit (URT) every day, and it is meaningful to accurately predict passenger flows for the purpose of intelligent system management. Considering the high traffic volume and complex spatial-temporal traffic patterns, accurate forecasting is quite challenging. Recently, advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks that combine graph convolution and recurrent units have achieved superior traffic forecasting performance. However, existing methods either simply use a predefined physical network or directly learn latent static graphs by assigning a large number of trainable parameters. Moreover, they only consider capturing local temporal dependencies. However, the passenger flows of URT exhibit both physical adjacent and virtual distant spatial correlations and both local and global temporal fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a Topology Augmented Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Network (TADSTN) to fully exploit the complex spatial-temporal dependencies of passenger flows and make accurate forecasting in URT. Specifically, we first propose a virtual graph generation algorithm with no training parameters to obtain a topology-augmented URT graph, and we also sample multipattern temporal features from raw passenger flow data. Then, we propose a parallel spatial-temporal learning architecture with a time-aware global-level attention mechanism to simultaneously capture both distant and dynamic spatial dependencies and both local and global temporal dependencies of passenger flows. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our TADSTN on two real-world datasets.

AB High-dimensional and unlabeled data collected from multi-sensor is a common scenario in practical production. The fault diagnosis and health stage (HS) division of bearing under different degradation processes is easily limited due to unlabeled and high-dimensional data. This work designs an intelligent fault diagnosis and HS division strategy for unlabeled and high-dimensional data. An adaptive tensor density peaks search (ATDPS) clustering algorithm is proposed for the HS division of rolling bearing. Moreover, to enhance the clustering performance, a novel neighborhood least square (NLS) technique is developed for feature space denoising, whose effectiveness and superiority are verified compared with the other feature space denoising techniques. The proposed strategies are subsequently applied to three benchmark cases and compared with other clustering methods. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can reliably and accurately divide the different degradation stages depending on less prior knowledge. Furthermore, the presented HS division approach successfully monitors degradation with compound failure, showing potential for practical application.

ID STOPPING CRITERION
AB In many machine learning applications, the labeling of datasets is done by human experts, which is usually time-consuming in cases of large data sets. This raises the need for methods to make optimal use of the human expert by selecting model instances for which the expert opinion is of most added value. This paper introduces the problem of active pairwise distance learning (APDL), where the goal is to actively learn the pairwise distances between all instances. Any distance function can be used, which means that APDL techniques can e.g., be used to determine likeness between faces or similarities between users for recommender systems. Starting with an unlabeled dataset, each round an expert determines the distance between one pair of instances. Thus, there is an important choice to make each round: 'Which combination of instances is presented to the expert?' The objective is to accurately predict all pairwise distances, while minimizing the usage of the expert. In this research, we establish upper and lower bound approximations (including an update rule) for the pairwise distances and evaluate many domain-independent query strategies. The observations from the experiments are therefore general, and the selection strategies are ideal candidates to function as baseline in future research. We show that using the criterion max degree consistently ranks amongst the best strategies. By using this criterion, the pairwise distances of a new dataset can be labeled much more efficiently.

DE RGBT tracking; Siamese network; Transformer; Template update strategy
AB Siamese-based RGBT trackers have attracted wide attention because of their high efficiency. However, there is a lack of an effective multimodal fusion module and information interaction between the search area and template area, which leads to poor performance of these siamese-based RGBT trackers. To solve this problem, inspire by the global information modeling capability of the transformer, we construct a siamese-based transformer RGBT tracker consisting of a single unified transformer module. Specifically, we propose a unified transformer fusion module to achieve feature extraction and global information interaction in the siamese RGBT tracker, i.e., the interaction between the search area and template area, the interaction between different modalities. It consists of self-attention and cross-attention, which are used to extract features and information interaction respectively. In addition, to alleviate the impact of multimodal fusion on the efficiency of template update in the tracking stage, we propose a feature-level template update strategy, which effectively improves tracking efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of our tracker, we evaluate it on five benchmark datasets including GTOT, RGBT210, RGBT234, LasHeR and VTUAV, and the results show that our tracker achieves excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Texture-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great promise in predicting various types of cancer, including lower grade glioma (LGG) through radiomics analysis. However, the use of CNN-based radiomics requires a large training set to avoid overfitting. To overcome this problem, the study proposes a novel panel of radiomic/texture features based on principal component analysis (PCA) applied to pretrained CNN features. The study used extracted PCA-CNN radiomic features from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images as input to a random forest (RF) classifier to predict immune cell markers, the gene status, and the survival outcome for LGG patients (n = 83). The results of the experiments demonstrate that RF with PCA-CNN radiomic features improved the classification performance, achieving the highest significant classification between short- and long-term survival outcomes. Notably, the area under the curve for PCA-CNN radiomic features with RF was 78.53% (p = 0.0008), which was significantly better than using gene status 63.14% (p = 0.23), clinical variables 52.60% (p = 0.32), standard radiomic features 72.56% (p = 0.02), immune cell markers 65.67% (p = 0.007), conditional entropy 74.54% (p = 0.0058), Gaussian mixture model-CNN 74.94% (p = 0.0053), or using 3D CNN classification directly without RF 72.61% (p = 0.01). The proposed PCA-CNN-based radiomic model outperformed state-of-the-art techniques to predict the survival outcome of LGG patients.

TI Infrared and visible image fusion based on VPDE model and VGG network

   algorithm; VGG network; Infrared and visible image fusion
AB Infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) image fusion techniques are widely applied to many high-level vision tasks, such as object detection, recognition, and tracking. However, most existing image fusion algorithms exhibit varying degrees of edge-step effect and texture information degradation in their fused images. To improve the fusion quality, an IR and VIS image fusion method based on a variational partial differential equation (VPDE) model and a VGG network is proposed. A productive smoothing segmentation is integrated into the energy function of the VPDE model, which is based on a novel regularization function. To decompose source images into low-frequency and high-frequency components, the new VPDE model is employed. To fuse low-frequency components, a probabilistic parameter model based on space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) is utilized rather than the traditional average fusion rule. Then, multi-layer features of the high-frequency components are extracted using a VGG network. To generate several candidates of the fused detail content, the l(1)-norm and weighted average rule are adopted, and the final details are obtained by using the maximum selection strategy. Finally, fused images are obtained by reconstructing the fused low-frequency and high-frequency components. Extensive experiments on the TNO and RoadScene datasets demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively eliminates artifacts as well as the step effect. In the subjective comparison, the proposed method can highlight the salient objects of the fused images while strengthening the texture information. In terms of the evaluation metrics, the proposed method outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods in objective comparison in addition to the subjective evaluation.

TI Quantile estimation for encrypted data

DE Full homomorphically encrypted data; Median; Optimization; Boxplot
AB As data-based studies continue to increase, the need for privacy protection has become a crucial issue. One proposed solution to address this obstacle is homomorphic encryption (HE); however, the complexity of handling ciphertexts used in HE poses a serious challenge due to the extended calculation time of elementary operations. As a result, it has much more complex than handling plaintexts, limiting various subsequent data analyses. This paper proposes a quantile estimation method for encrypted data, where quantiles are core statistics for understanding the data distribution in statistical analysis. We developed an HE-friendly method for large homomorphic encrypted data using an approximate quantile loss function. Numerical studies show that the proposed method significantly improves the calculation time for simulated and real homomorphically encrypted data. Specifically, the proposed method takes approximately 26 minutes for calculating a dataset of four million, which is about 14 times faster than the sorting method. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method to construct boxplots for homomorphically encrypted data.

DE Reinforcement learning from images; Robot learning; Data augmentation;
   Bootstrap ensembles
AB Learning from visual observations is a significant yet challenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Two respective problems, representation learning and task learning, need to solve to infer an optimal policy. Some methods have been proposed to utilize data augmentation in reinforcement learning to directly learn from images. Although these methods can improve generation in RL, they are often found to make the task learning unsteady and can even lead to divergence. We investigate the causes of instability and find it is usually rooted in high-variance of Q-functions. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement and unified method to solve above-mentioned problems, Data-augmented Reinforcement Learning with Ensemble Exploration and Exploitation (DAR-EEE). Bootstrap ensembles are incorporated into data augmented reinforcement learning and provide uncertainty estimation of both original and augmented states, which can be utilized to stabilize and accelerate the task learning. Specially, a novel strategy called uncertainty-weighted exploitation is designed for rational utilization of transition tuples. Moreover, an efficient exploration method using the highest upper confidence is used to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the improved sample efficiency and final performance of our method on a range of difficult image-based control tasks. Especially, our method has achieved the new state-of-the-art performance on Reacher-easy and Cheetah-run tasks.

ID REGRESSION; QUALITY
AB Pan-sharpening is a fundamental and crucial task in the remote sensing image processing field, which generates a high-resolution multi-spectral image by fusing a low-resolution multi-spectral image and a high-resolution panchromatic image. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown competitive results in pan-sharpening. However, diverse features in the multi-spectral and panchromatic images are not fully extracted and exploited in existing deep learning methods, which leads to information loss in the pan-sharpening process. To solve this problem, a novel pan-sharpening method based on multi-resolution transformer and two-stage feature fusion is proposed in this article. Specifically, a transformer-based multi-resolution feature extractor is designed to extract diverse image features. Then, to fully exploit features with different content and characteristics, a two-stage feature fusion strategy is adopted. In the first stage, a multi-resolution fusion module is proposed to fuse multi-spectral and panchromatic features at each scale. In the second stage, a shallow-deep fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow and deep features for detail generation. Experiments over QuickBird and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches visually and quantitatively with fewer parameters. Moreover, the ablation study and feature map analysis also prove the effectiveness of the transformer-based multi-resolution feature extractor and the two -stage fusion scheme.

AB The development of the new liberal arts field places emphasis on the integration of disciplines such as humanities, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. It specifically highlights the incorporation of new technologies into the education and training of liberal arts majors like economics, law, literature, history, and philosophy. However, when dealing with complex talent data, shallow machine learning algorithms may not provide sufficiently accurate evaluations of the relationship between input and output. To address this challenge, this article introduces a comprehensive evaluation model for applied talents based on an improved Deep Belief Network (DBN). In this model, the GAAHS algorithm iteratively generates optimal values that are utilized as connection weights and biases for the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) in the pre-training stage of the DBN. This approach ensures that the weights and biases have favorable initial values. Moreover, the paper constructs a quality evaluation index system for creative talents, which consists of four components: knowledge level, innovation practice ability, adaptability to the environment, and psychological quality. The training results demonstrate that the optimized DBN exhibits improved convergence speed and precision, thereby achieving higher accuracy in the classification of applied talent evaluations.

DE Traffic flow prediction; Intelligent transportation systems; Artificial
   intelligence; Graph convolution neural networks; Time series prediction
AB Accurately predicting traffic flow on roads is crucial to address urban traffic congestion and save on travel time. However, this is a challenging task due to the strong spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data. Existing traffic flow prediction methods based on graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks often overlook the dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies between road nodes and excessively focus on the local spatiotemporal dependencies of traffic flow, thereby failing to effectively model global spatiotemporal dependencies. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a new Spatio-temporal Causal Graph Attention Network (STCGAT). STCGAT utilizes a node embedding technique that enables the generation of spatial adjacency subgraphs on a per-time-step basis, without requiring any prior geographic information. This obviates the necessity for intricate modeling of constantly changing graph topologies. Additionally, STCGAT introduces a proficient causal temporal correlation module that encompasses node-adaptive learning, graph convolution, as well as local and global causal temporal convolution modules. This module effectively captures both local and global Spatio-temporal dependencies. The proposed STCGAT model is extensively evaluated on traffic datasets. The results show that it outperforms all baseline models consistently.

AB Typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to recognize a user's stress state using the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is the latest brain imaging technology. fNIRS signals are usually fed into CNN models in the form of high-dimensional image data. However, this approach is not easy to achieve high classification accuracy because of physiological noises in brain signals. It is also likely to overlook the process of evaluating the reliability of calculated classification accuracy. To solve these problems, we proposed a memristor-based CNN (M-CNNs) This model's weight update process involves using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), where the normalized conductances of memristors are used as weight substitutes. These conductances are then adjusted to classify stress states. We calculated the classification accuracies between the control and stress groups by using the M-CNNs, and then compared them with those of the CNNs. We used DenseNet, the most recent CNN model, to simulate accuracy under the same conditions. To ensure a fair comparison, we divided the DenseNet into the memristor-based DenseNet (M-DenseNet) and the conventional DenseNet (C-DenseNet). As a result, we discovered that the accuracy of M-CNNs (93.33%) exceeded that of CNNs (87.50%), and is reliable by precision, recall, and F-Score calculated from a confusion matrix. Likewise, M-DenseNet (92.38%) has higher accuracy than C-DenseNet (90.00%), but shows lower accuracy than M-CNNs. Moreover, we observed the reproducibility of M-CNN/DenseNet in various datasets. Therefore, our study suggests a promising application of CNN by combining conductances of memristor for classifying stress states.

AB Traffic assignment is of great importance in real life from foot traffic assignment of a building to vehicle traffic assignment of a city. With the rapid increase of the number of agents and the size of the traffic network, the problem becomes more and more challenging nowadays. To solve large-scale efficient dynamic traffic assignment, this article proposes a decentralized control approach to achieving this. First, we transform the traffic assignment problem into a routing rule generation problem by designing a corresponding simulation-based optimization framework that can evaluate the performance of routing rules. Then, we propose a genetic programming hyper-heuristic algorithm to generate the optimal routing rule. During execution, agents can collect environmental information and plan their paths when moving according to the generated rule. In this way, the proposed method can handle the dynamically changing traffic flow efficiently instead of pre-planing the whole path for each agent. The proposed method is verified on both synthetic networks and real-world networks in terms of sensitivity, generality, and scalability. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective in urban-scale traffic networks and outperforms the compared algorithms.

AB Inspired by the success of vision-language methods (VLMs) in zero-shot classification, recent works attempt to extend this line of work into object detection by leveraging the localization ability of pretrained VLMs and generating pseudolabels for unseen classes in a self-training manner. However, since the current VLMs are usually pretrained with aligning sentence embedding with global image embedding, the direct use of them lacks fine-grained alignment for object instances, which is the core of detection. In this article, we propose a simple but effective fine-grained visual-text prompt-driven self-training paradigm for open-vocabulary detection (VTP-OVD) that introduces a fine-grained visual-text prompt adapting stage to enhance the current self-training paradigm with a more powerful fine-grained alignment. During the adapting stage, we enable VLM to obtain fine-grained alignment using learnable text prompts to resolve an auxiliary dense pixelwise prediction task. Furthermore, we propose a visual prompt module to provide the prior task information (i.e., the categories need to be predicted) for the vision branch to better adapt the pretrained VLM to the downstream tasks. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for open-vocabulary object detection, e.g., 31.5% mAP on unseen classes of COCO.

ID MODEL
AB This article presents a simple yet effective two-stage framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Unlike prior state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods that predominantly rely on pseudo supervision directly on predictions, such as consistency regularization and pseudo labeling, our key insight is to explore the feature representation learning with labeled and unlabeled (i.e., pseudo labeled) images to regularize a more compact and better-separated feature space, which paves the way for low-density decision boundary learning and therefore enhances the segmentation performance. A stage-adaptive contrastive learning method is proposed, containing a boundary-aware contrastive loss that takes advantage of the labeled images in the first stage, as well as a prototype-aware contrastive loss to optimize both labeled and pseudo labeled images in the second stage. To obtain more accurate prototype estimation, which plays a critical role in prototype-aware contrastive learning, we present an aleatoric uncertainty-aware method to generate higher quality pseudo labels. Aleatoric-uncertainty adaptive (AUA) adaptively regularizes prediction consistency by taking advantage of image ambiguity, which, given its significance, is underexplored by existing works. Our method achieves the best results on three public medical image segmentation benchmarks.

AB Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to building models without accessing raw user data, especially in healthcare. In real applications, different federations can seldom work together due to possible reasons such as data heterogeneity and distrust/inexistence of the central server. In this article, we propose a novel framework called MetaFed to facilitate trustworthy FL between different federations. obtains a personalized model for each federation without a central server via the proposed cyclic knowledge distillation. Specifically, treats each federation as a meta distribution and aggregates knowledge of each federation in a cyclic manner. The training is split into two parts: common knowledge accumulation and personalization. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that without a server achieves better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods e.g., 10%+ accuracy improvement compared with the baseline for physical activity monitoring dataset (PAMAP2) with fewer communication costs. More importantly, shows remarkable performance in real-healthcare-related applications.

ID PREDICTION
AB Random feature-based online multikernel learning (RF-OMKL) is a promising low-complexity framework for machine learning optimization from continuous streaming data. Nonetheless, it is still an open problem to find an efficient algorithm with an analytical performance guarantee due to the challenge of an underlying online biconvex optimization (OBO). The state-of-the-art method named expert-based online multikernel learning (EoKle) tackled this problem approximately with the lens of expert-based online learning, in which multiple kernels (or experts) optimize their own kernel functions separately and the best sole one is determined via Hedge algorithm. It is asymptotically optimal as to the best sole kernel function in hindsight. We propose collaborative expert-based online multikernel learning (CoKle) by devising a collaborative Hedge (CoHedge) algorithm, in which kernel functions separately optimized as in EoKle are combined in an asymptotically optimal way. It is proved that CoKle is asymptotically optimal as to the best combination of each optimal kernel function in hindsight. Remarkably, this is the first method with a theoretical performance guarantee for expert-based RF-OMKL. Despite its effectiveness, CoKle is inherently suboptimal due to the individual optimization of kernel functions. We address this by presenting an OBO-based method (named BoKle) and partially prove its asymptotic optimality for RF-OMKL. Thus, BoKle can outperform the suboptimal expert-based methods such as CoKle and EoKle. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of BoKle via experiments with real datasets.

   learning (CFL); federated learning (FL)
AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning (ML) framework that operates under privacy and communication constraints. To mitigate the data heterogeneity underlying FL, clustered FL (CFL) was proposed to learn customized models for different client groups. However, due to the lack of effective client selection strategies, the CFL process is relatively slow, and the model performance is also limited in the presence of nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) client data. In this work, for the first time, we propose selecting participating clients for each cluster with active learning (AL) and call our method active client selection for CFL (ACFL). More specifically, in each ACFL round, each cluster filters out a small set of clients, which are the most informative clients according to some AL metrics e.g., uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee (QBC), loss, and aggregates only its model updates to update the cluster-specific model. We empirically evaluate our ACFL approach on the public MNIST, CIFAR-10, and LEAF synthetic datasets with class-imbalanced settings. Compared with several FL and CFL baselines, the results reveal that ACFL can dramatically speed up the learning process while requiring less client participation and significantly improving model accuracy with a relatively low communication overhead.

AB We address a challenging problem-modeling high-dimensional, long-range dependencies between nonnormal multivariates, which is important for demanding applications such as cross-market modeling (CMM). With heterogeneous indicators and markets, CMM aims to capture between-market financial couplings and influence over time and within-market interactions between financial variables. We make the first attempt to integrate deep variational sequential learning with copula-based statistical dependence modeling and characterize both temporal dependence degrees and structures between hidden variables representing nonnormal multivariates. Our copula variational learning network weighted partial regular vine copula-based variational long short-term memory (WPVC-VLSTM) integrates variational long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and regular vine copula to model variational sequential dependence degrees and structures. The regular vine copula models nonnormal distributional dependence degrees and structures. VLSTM captures variational long-range dependencies coupling high-dimensional dynamic hidden variables without strong hypotheses and multivariate constraints. WPVC-VLSTM outperforms benchmarks, including linear models, stochastic volatility models, deep neural networks, and variational recurrent networks in terms of both technical significance and portfolio forecasting performance. WPVC-VLSTM shows a step-forward for CMM and deep variational learning.

AB Sentiment analysis is an important natural language processing issue that has many applications in various fields. The increasing popularity of social networks and growth and development of their related tools and technologies has led to share the users' multimodal content and opinions in a hybrid form of different media, including texts, images, videos, audio and emojis. The increasing interest of users to share their content using a combination of several media has significantly increased the amount of multimodal data. Most of the comments that users post in the social media have emotional aspects and provide useful indicators for many purposes. Compared to single-modal data, such as text-only or image-only comments, multimodal data contain more useful information and leads to better understanding of the real sentiments of users. Many studies have been conducted in this area, each of which deals with one or some of the various common challenges of multimodal sentiment analysis methods, including incomplete data, heterogeneity of modals, fusion method of the results, interactions between modals, and existence of unrelated, insufficient and redundant data and information. The emergence of deep neural networks and the evolution of deep learning tools and techniques has led to the development of deep learning-based approaches to multimodal sentiment analysis to address its challenges and constraints. This paper is a comprehensive comparative survey of sentiment analysis approaches, challenges, applications, and trends, with a special focus on deep learning-based multimodal sentiment analysis methods. Examining the limitations of the recent studies, describing possible future solutions and evaluating existing challenges are also taken into consideration and future direction of the methods are evaluated.

AB In the event of a fire breaking out or in other complicated situations, a mobile computing solution combining the Internet of Things and wearable devices can actually assist tracking solutions for rescuing and evacuating people in multistory structures. Thus, it is crucial to increase the positioning technology's accuracy. The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach is used in various applications such as target tracking and intelligent surveillance, which rely on smartphone-based inertial data sequences. However, the SMC method has intrinsic flaws, such as sample impoverishment and particle degeneracy. A novel SMC approach is presented, which is built on the weighted differential evolution (WDE) algorithm. Sequential Monte Carlo approaches start with random particle placements and arrives at the desired distribution with a slower variance reduction, like in a high-dimensional space, such as a multistory structure. Weighted differential evolution is included before the resampling procedure to guarantee the appropriate variety of the particle set, prevent the usage of an inadequate number of valid samples, and preserve smartphone user position accuracy. The values of the smartphone-based sensors and BLE-beacons are set as input to the SMC, which aids in fast approximating the posterior distributions, to speed up the particle congregation process in the proposed SMC-based WDE approach. Lastly, the robustness and efficacy of the suggested technique more accurately reflect the actual situation of smartphone users. According to simulation findings, the suggested approach provides improved location estimation with reduced localization error and quick convergence. The results confirm that the proposed optimal fusion-based SMC-WDE scheme performs 9.92% better in terms of MAPE, 15.24% for the case of MAE, and 0.031% when evaluating based on the R2 Score.

SO VIETNAM JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

DT Article; Early Access
DE File fragment classification; digital forensics; neural networks
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIGITAL FORENSICS; IDENTIFICATION; TUTORIAL
AB This paper presents an approach to improve the file fragment classification by proposing new features for classification and evaluating them on a dataset that includes both low- and high-entropy file fragments. High-entropy fragments, belonging to compressed and encrypted files, are particularly challenging to classify because they lack exploitable patterns. To address this challenge, the proposed feature vectors are constructed based on the byte frequency distribution (BFD) of file fragments, along with discrete Fourier transform coefficients and several randomness measures. These feature vectors are tested using three machine learning models: Support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and random forests (RFs). The proposed approach is evaluated on the govdocs1 dataset, which is freely available and widely used in this field, to enable reproducibility and fair comparison with other published research. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves better classification accuracy for both low- and high-entropy file fragments.

AB It is known that bond strength is affected by the application conditions and methods of adhesive connections. Knowing which method can increase the joint strength more and choosing those methods is important in terms of preventing time loss and financial losses. This study aims to experimentally examine the effects of aluminum alloy and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite panels on the mechanical properties of adhesive thickness, different temperatures, pressure and filler in adhesive joints and model data. Experiments were carried out by using AA7075-T6/CFRP panels with single lap joint bonding joints, unfilled, 1% and 2% by weight carbon fiber filled, at 19, 50 and 100 & DEG;C and also by pressing under 2 MPa pressure without applying pressure. It is understood from the results that the parameters that affect the bond strength the most are the adhesive thickness and the amount of pressing applied on it. The effect of the experiments carried out under these conditions on the tensile failure load values was examined, and also artificial neural network (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) models were presented for failure load estimation. The R-2 values of the ANN model are 0.9456. The R-2 values of the GEP model are 0.9029-0.9572 for training and validation, respectively. High accuracy rates were obtained with both models. It is seen that there is a good agreement between the observed and predicted values in the errors of the training and validation sets. As a result, it was concluded that ANN and GEP models can be used to select the optimum value in similar applications.

AB The selection of proper classifiers for a given data set is full of challenges. The critical problem of classifier selection is how to extract feature from data sets. This paper proposes a new method for feature extraction of a data set. Our method not only preserves the geometrical structure of a data set, but also characterizes the decision boundary of classification problems. Specifically speaking, the extracted feature can recover a data set that has the same Euclidean geometrical structure as the original data set. We present an efficient algorithm to compute the similarity between data set features. We theoretically analyze how the similarity between our features affects the performance of the support vector machine, a well-known classifier. The empirical results show that our method is effective in finding suitable classifiers.

AB Fires in smart cities can have devastating consequences, causing damage to property, and endangering the lives of citizens. Traditional fire detection methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed, making it challenging to detect fires in real time. This paper proposes an improved fire detection approach for smart cities based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, called the smart fire detection system (SFDS), which leverages the strengths of deep learning to detect fire-specific features in real time. The SFDS approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of fire detection, reduce false alarms, and be cost-effective compared to traditional fire detection methods. It can also be extended to detect other objects of interest in smart cities, such as gas leaks or flooding. The proposed framework for a smart city consists of four primary layers: (i) Application layer, (ii) Fog layer, (iii) Cloud layer, and (iv) IoT layer. The proposed algorithm utilizes Fog and Cloud computing, along with the IoT layer, to collect and process data in real time, enabling faster response times and reducing the risk of damage to property and human life. The SFDS achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both precision and recall, with a high precision rate of 97.1% for all classes. The proposed approach has several potential applications, including fire safety management in public areas, forest fire monitoring, and intelligent security systems.

AB The problem of leader-following attitude consensus for multiple rigid-body systems is addressed for communication limitation in this paper. The leader and followers are described in unit quaternions forms. For each follower, a nonlinear finite-time distributed observer is proposed to estimate the states of the leader, and the event-triggered finite-time sliding mode controllers are constructed by using the estimation information to decrease the system's communication and computation consumption. The result demonstrates that in a finite time, the attitude tracking error can converge to an invariant set, and the communication interaction is decreased by the proposed event-triggered-based controller. Moreover, Zeno behavior is rigorously proved to be excluded, and the lower bound of the triggered time interval is provided. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed control protocol.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Gender bias; Selective privacy-preserving; Negative multi-task learning;
   Classification
AB Deep learning models have showcased remarkable performances in natural language processing tasks. While much attention has been paid to improvements in utility, privacy leakage and social bias are two major concerns arising in trained models. In this paper, we address both privacy protection and gender bias mitigation in classification models simultaneously. We first introduce a selective privacy-preserving method that obscures individuals' sensitive information by adding noise to word embeddings. Then, we propose a negative multi-task learning framework to mitigate gender bias, which involves a main task and a gender prediction task. The main task employs a positive loss constraint for utility assurance, while the gender prediction task utilizes a negative loss constraint to remove gender-specific features. We have analyzed four existing word embeddings and evaluated them for sentiment analysis and medical text classification tasks within the proposed negative multi-task learning framework. For instances, RoBERTa achieves the best performance with an average accuracy of 95% for both negative and positive sentiment, with 1.1 disparity score and 1.6 disparity score respectively, and GloVe achieves the best average accuracy of 96.42% with a 0.28 disparity score for the medical task. Our experimental results indicate that our negative multi-task learning framework can effectively mitigate gender bias while maintaining model utility for both sentiment analysis and medical text classification.

DE Image denoising; Convolutional neural network; Dual-tree complex wavelet

AB The difficulty in image denoising arises from the need to recover complex texture regions. Previous methods have struggled with this task, producing images that are too smooth and are prone to aliasing and checkerboard patterns in complex regions. To address these issues, we propose an image denoising network based on subband information sharing using dual-tree complex wavelet. This network combines the spatial and transform domains through dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) to capture both spatially structured features and time-frequency localized features for enriching the feature space. To strengthen the recovery in hard scenes, such as weak textures and high-frequency details, Subband Information Sharing Unit (SISU) is designed for the interplay of information in the transform domain, establishing the complementarity and correlation among the subbands obtained by DTCWT. Moreover, rectified linear units and exponential linear units are used in the spatial and transform domains, respectively, to match the properties of elements in different domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the powerful recovery capability of the network for both textured and smooth regions, as well as the competitive results of the network in non-blind/blind image denoising.

AB The problem of the globally asymptotical synchronization is studied for the system of fractional-order delayed octonion-valued BAM neural networks (FODOVBAMNNs) and the problem of the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization is researched for the system of fractional-order octonion-valued BAM neural networks (FOVBAMNNs), respectively. First, the new octonion-valued models are established for investigated systems with linear threshold activation functions which can be useful for the reduction in computation. Then, because of neither commutativity nor associativity of octonion multiplication, the novel systems of FODOVBAMNNs and FOVBAMNNs are separated into four dimensionality reduction systems which can be called fractional-order delayed complex-valued BAM neural networks (FODCVBAMNNs) and fractional-order complex-valued BAM neural networks (FCVBAMNNs) owe to the application of Cayley-Dichson approach. In addition, the further criteria are acquired for the problems of the globally asymptotical synchronization and the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization for FODOVBAMNNs and FOVBAMNNs by the feature of Caputo fractional derivative, methods for dynamic analysis of delayed neural networks, interactive character of BAM, the novel LKFs, the very recent inequalities containing some parameters and the new design for the linear feedback controllers including sign function and so on. Finally, two simulation examples are demonstrated to express the feasibility and improvement of the obtained results.

AB In this paper, some Gronwall-type integral inequalities with discrete and distributed delays are explored to analyze differential or integral systems with hybrid delays. These new inequalities generalize some previous ones which have played an important part in the research on dynamic behavior of systems. Based on the established Henry-Gronwall type integral inequality, an improved criterion is derived to ensure the finite-time stability for a class of fractional-order neural networks with hybrid delays. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and the less conservativeness of the obtained criterion.

ID EVOLUTIONARY
AB In this article, a novel multi-strategy adaptive selection-based dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithm (MSAS-DMOA) is proposed, which adopts the non-inductive transfer learning (TL) paradigm to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). In particular, based on a scoring system that evaluates environmental changes, the source domain is adaptively constructed with several optional groups to enrich the knowledge. Along with a group of guide solutions, the importance of historical experiences is estimated via the kernel mean matching (KMM) method, which avoids designing strategies to label individuals. The proposed MSAS-DMOA is comprehensively evaluated on 14 DMOPs, and the results show an overwhelming performance improvement in terms of both convergence and diversity as compared with other four popular DMOAs. In addition, ablation studies are also conducted to validate the superiority of the applied strategies in MSAS-DMOA, which can effectively alleviate the negative transfer phenomenon. Without the conventional labeling procedure, the proposed method also yields satisfactory results, which can provide valuable reference for designing other evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO) algorithms.

AB To handle the tracking problem of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems with matched and mismatched composite disturbances, this article studies a predefined-time backstepping controller by resorting to a Lyapunov-based predefined-time dynamic paradigm, a regulation function, and neural networks (NNs). Moreover, an adding-absolute-value (ADV) technique is adopted in the design process to remove the control singularity. Theoretical analyses prove the boundedness of all closed-loop system signals and the predefined-time convergence of the tracking error into an arbitrarily small vicinity of the origin. The proposed controller exhibits four advantages: 1) the actual convergence time is precisely predefined by only one design parameter irrespective of the initial conditions, and the control energy is economized; 2) no unbounded terms are adopted for predefining the actual convergence time, thus avoiding numerical overflow problem under limited memory space and gaining strong noise-tolerant ability; 3) the peaking tracking error and control input magnitude can be effectively reduced by appropriately setting parameters of the regulation function; and 4) the controller is continuous and nonsingular everywhere. Finally, a practical example of a single-link manipulator is presented to validate the efficacy and superiority of our predefined-time controller.

AB Despite the proved effectiveness of deep learning models in solving complex problems, the melanoma diagnosis remains as a challenging task mainly due to the high levels of inter and intra-class variability present in images of moles. Aimed at filling this gap, in this work we propose a novel architecture for melanoma diagnosis which is inspired on multi-view learning and data augmentation. In order to make the model more transformation-invariant, the proposed architecture creates different independent and specific views of an image. The transformations applied on the original images are learned by genetic algorithms which find the best set of transformations. Also, the final predictions are yielded by aggregating information that comes from independent views. To evaluate the suitability of the proposal, an extensive experimental study on fifteen public melanoma-image datasets was conducted. The impact of the parameters of the genetic algorithms on the proposed architecture were analyzed, and it was also demonstrated that the proposed architecture attained better results when using transformations derived from the genetic algorithm than using random transformations. Finally, the results showed the suitability of the proposed model, where four state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques were significantly outperformed.

DE Recommender system; Ontology; Cold-start problem; Diversity; Serendipity
AB Every real-life environments where users interact with items (products, films, research expert profiles) have several development phases. In the Cold-start phase, there are almost no interactions among users and items content-based recommendation systems (RS) can only recommend based on matching the attributes of the items. In the transition state, items start to collect user interactions but still a significant number of items have too small number of interactions, RS does not allow users to discover cold items. In a regular state, where most of the items in the system have enough interactions, the recommendations often suffer from low diversity of the items within a single recommendation. This article proposes a general recommendation algorithm based on Ontological-similarity, which is designed to address all the above problems. Our experiments show that recommendations generated by our approach are consistently better in all environment development phases and increase the success rate of recommendations by almost 50% measured using ontology-aware recall, which is also introduced in this article.

AB Certain categorical sequence clustering applications require path connectivity, such as the clustering of DNA, click-paths through web-user sessions, or paths of care clustering with sequences of patient medical billing codes. K-means and k-medoids clustering with non-Euclidean distance metrics such as the Jaccard or edit distances maintains such path connectivity. Although k-means and k-medoids clustering with the Jaccard and edit distances have enjoyed success in these domains, the limits of accurate cluster recovery in these conditions have not yet been defined. As a first step in approaching this goal, we performed a simulated study using k-means and k-medoids clustering with non-Euclidean distances and show the performance deteriorates at a certain level of noise and when the number of clusters increases. However, we identify initialization strategies that improve upon cluster recovery in the presence of noise. We employ the use of the Tibshirani and Guenther (J Comput Graph Stat 14(3):511-528, 2005) Prediction Strength method, which creates a hypothesis testing scenario that determines if there is clustering structure to the data (if the clusters are reproducible), with the null hypothesis being there is none. We then applied the framework to perinatal episodes of care and the clusters reproducibly and organically split between Cesarean and vaginal deliveries, which itself is not a clinical finding but sensibly validates the approach. Further visualizations of the clusters did bring insights into subclusters that split along groups of physicians, cost and risk scores, warranting the outlined future work into ways of improving this framework for better resolution.

AB Seizures are the most prevalent clinical indication of neurological disorders in neonates. In this study, a class-imbalance aware and explainable deep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) is proposed for the accurate automated detection of neonatal seizures. The proposed model integrates the temporal information of EEG signals with the spatial information on the EEG channels through the graph representation of the multi-channel EEG segments. One-dimensional CNNs are used to automatically develop a feature set that accurately represents the differences between seizure and nonseizure epochs in the time domain. By employing GAT, the attention mechanism is utilized to emphasize the critical channel pairs and information flow among brain regions. GAT coefficients were then used to empirically visualize the important regions during the seizure and nonseizure epochs, which can provide valuable insight into the location of seizures in the neonatal brain. Additionally, to tackle the severe class imbalance in the neonatal seizure dataset using under-sampling and focal loss techniques are used. Overall, the final Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT) outperformed previous benchmarked methods with a mean AUC of 96.6% and Kappa of 0.88, demonstrating its high accuracy and potential for clinical applications.

ID DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CURSE
AB Modern pattern recognition applications are frequently associated with high-dimensional datasets. In the last decades, different approaches have been proposed to address the curse of dimensionality phenomena present in this kind of data. Principal component analysis is a classic method that even today is widely used for this purpose. However, its procedure is based in the covariance matrix, which is built by the feature vectors scalar product in a point-wise fashion. This makes it very sensible to noise and outliers. This work presents a patch-based mapping to an entropic space. Given a data sample neighborhood, each feature value set is mapped to an univariate Gaussian distribution described by its parameters. Then, each scalar coordinate of a data sample is replaced by the parameter tuple that describes each feature. The difference between two data sample vectors in the entropic space is defined as the vector where each scalar coordinate is given by the stochastic divergence between two probability distributions. The covariance matrix is still defined by the scalar product between the difference vector of a data sample and the average sample, so it can be used with transparency in the original PCA algorithm. This patch mapping in the entropic space aims to mitigate the effect of noise and outliers. Experiments adopting the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence show that the new framework can outperform several existing dimensionality reduction algorithms in cluster analysis tasks in multiple real datasets.

AB Multi-label classification is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but not much attention has been paid to interpretability. In this paper, we develop a multi-label classifier that can be represented as a concise set of simple "if-then" rules, and thus, it offers better interpretability compared to black-box models. Notably, our method is able to find a small set of relevant patterns that lead to accurate multi-label classification, while existing rule-based classifiers are myopic and wasteful in searching rules, requiring a large number of rules to achieve high accuracy. In particular, we formulate the problem of choosing multi-label rules to maximize a target function, which considers not only discrimination ability with respect to labels, but also diversity. Accounting for diversity helps to avoid redundancy, and thus, to control the number of rules in the solution set. To tackle the said maximization problem, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm, which circumvents the exponential-size search space of rules using a novel technique to sample highly discriminative and diverse rules. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we provide a thorough experimental evaluation and a case study, which indicate that our approach offers a trade-off between predictive performance and interpretability that is unmatched in previous work.

AB Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy, which leads to vision loss and is irreversible due to damage in the optic nerve head mainly caused by increased intra-ocular pressure. Retinal fundus photography facilitates ophthalmologist in detection of glaucoma but is subjective to human intervention and is time-consuming. Computational methods such as image processing and machine learning classifiers can aid in computer-based glaucoma detection which helps in mass screening of glaucoma. In this context, the proposed method develops an automated glaucoma detection system, in the following steps: (i) pre-processing by segmenting the blood vessels using directional filter; (ii) segmenting the region of interest by using statistical features; (iii) extracting the clinical and texture-based features; and (iv) developing ensemble of classifier models using dynamic selection techniques. The proposed method is evaluated on two publically available datasets and 300 fundus images collected from a hospital. The best results are obtained using ensemble of random forest using META-DES dynamic ensemble selection technique, and the average specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for glaucoma detection on hospital dataset are 100%, respectively. For RIM-ONE dataset, the average specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for glaucoma detection are 100%, 93.85% and 97.86%, respectively. For Drishti dataset, the average specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for glaucoma detection are 90%, 100% and 97%, respectively. The quantitative results and comparative study indicate the ability of the developed method, and thus, it can be deployed in mass screening and also as a second opinion in decision making by the ophthalmologist for glaucoma detection.

AB Early detection of oral cancer is essential for improving survival rates and diagnostic precision. Raman cyto-spectroscopy is a useful method, but its interpretive complexity prevents frequent clinical use. Prediction algorithms have been used to evaluate RS data and create CAD systems. An ensemble of MLAs and dimensionality reduction techniques has been demonstrated to effectively analyse the complex RS. In present study we utilised two MLA ensembles-(1) Linear Discriminant Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier (2) LDA with Support Vector Machine. Results show that RS of oral epithelial cells, collected from different study groups (viz. Normal-healthy volunteers; histo-pathologically confirmed- potentially cancerable- leucoplakia and cancer patients-OSCC) when classified using the ensembles had better overall accuracy of (88 & PLUSMN; 8%) as compared to either DTC (48 & PLUSMN; 19%) or SVM (58 & PLUSMN; 15%) when applied individually. Class-wise evaluation showed improved performance of LDA-SVM compared to LDA-DTC, and blind test was performed with RS of habitual cigarette smokers (CS) as susceptible group and healthy volunteers as control group to assess the classifier ensembles' performance in cancer risk prediction. The LDA-SVM ensemble showed the highest classification accuracy, indicating that it can be used to accurately detect oral cancer risk and screen susceptible patients.

AB In recent years, with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence and the rapid development of technology, various sports sectors have benefited from technological and scientific advancements. The technical and scientific components that have permeated different sports sectors are becoming progressively less important as technology developments and the IoT requires disconnected. To address this problem, this study proposed a based deep learning technique for the tennis sports industry and the implications of smart athletes' fitness using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The three basic categories of IoT-based smart fitness are player trackers, which include wearable and non-wearable sensors, movement analysis, and player applications. The skills and strategies of tennis players have improved through the use of sports products, and people have come to value physical education more as education has expanded. The development of a smart tennis system is meant to address the slow detection and unpredictable player and coaching staff movements of the traditional game of tennis. The background of the video is rebuilt using a median filter algorithm, and its target is located using an inter-frame difference technique to identify the track's designated shoulder marker point. Using an enhanced SVM, it creates a tennis service model for evaluating and examining marker point tracks. The experimental results compare the proposed method with different machine learning methods such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. The classification achieved excellent performance by the player motions, and the SVM is better than the other deep learning. The test results proposed scheme the tennis service model achieves a classification accuracy of 97.5% in accurately categorizing different types of service trajectories.

AB The effectiveness of treatment for lung nodules is significantly impacted by early diagnosis of the nodules on CT scans. Radiologists are aided by the utilization of CAD technologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for identifying lung cancer: "(i) pre-processing, (ii) segmentation, (iii) feature extraction, and (iv) detection." The GF methods commence with the input image being pre-processed. To segment the pre-processed images, a "improved cross-entropy-based active contour segmentation model" is implemented. Then, using a CNN that has been optimized, features such as LBP, entropy, and contrast are computed. The self-adaptive tunicate swarm algorithm (SATSA) is used to optimize CNN weights. For this study, the LIDC-IDRI dataset was used, and Python was used for experimentation. Because pulmonary nodules can differ significantly in size, shape, texture, and appearance, it's crucial to include a wide variety of patterns in the training dataset. The authors hope to improve the generalization and robustness of the CNN model in identifying lung nodules by incorporating a large number of patterns. Comparing the CNN + SATSA model to existing models allowed researchers to assess its effectiveness in identifying lung nodules. The suggested model's correctness is demonstrated by its high recall, false discovery rate, FNR, MCC, FPR, precision, FOR, accuracy, specificity, NPV, FMS, and sensitivity values.

AB Data recorded from monitoring the health condition of industrial equipment are often high-dimensional, nonlinear, nonstationary and characterised by high levels of uncertainty. These factors limit the efficiency of machine learning techniques to produce desirable results when developing effective fault classification frameworks. This paper sought to propose a hybrid artificial intelligent predictive maintenance model based on Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) optimised by the combination of Coupled Simulated Annealing and Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation algorithms (ICEEMDAN-PCA-LSSVM). Here, ICEEMDAN was first employed as a denoising technique to decompose signals into a series of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of which only relevant IMFs containing the relevant fault features were retained for signal reconstruction. PCA was then employed as a dimension reduction technique through which the resulting set of uncorrelated features extracted served as input for LSSVM for classifying various fault types. The proposed technique is compared with three established methods [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)] with multiclass classification capabilities. The various techniques were tested on an experimental UCI machine learning benchmark data obtained from multi-sensors of a hydraulic test rig. The results from the analysis revealed that the proposed ICEEMDAN-PCA-LSSVM technique is versatile and outperformed all the compared classifiers in terms of accuracy, error rate and other evaluation metrics considered. The proposed hybrid technique drastically reduced the redundancies and the dimension of features, allowing for the efficient consideration of relevant features for the enhancement of classification accuracy and convergence speed.

AB Inspired by Li (2019) who considers one parameter, we propose a novel two-parameter coherent fuzzy number (TPCFN) that can flexibly capture investors' attitudes (pessimistic, optimistic, or neutral). We define the possibilistic density function, the possibilistic distribution function, the possibilistic mean, and the possibilistic variance of the TPCFN for the first time. Furthermore, we derive the above statistical characteristics with numerical expressions through rigorous mathematical proof. The monotonicity of the possibilistic mean and possibilistic variance are presented by the first-order derivative and illustrated with figures in detail. In addition, we discuss the investors' attitudes by using different parameter values and their influences on the mean and variance. Then, we construct an equal-weighted model, a mean-variance model, and a regret minimization model with TPCFN, respectively. We carry out a sensitivity analysis to explore the parametric influence on the model's solution. At the same time, we compare different models with the same parameter values. Finally, we use a numerical example to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed models. We compare the performance of the three models by five indexes (annual return, Sharpe ratio, beta value, unsystematic risk, and alpha value). The results show that optimistic investors can obtain more gains in the three models. Our minimization model considering the regret factor outperforms the mean-variance model and the equal-weighted portfolio in returns when the parameter values are the same.

AB The development of society has made the spread of city brands an important factor affecting city value. In the research process of this article, we will explore people's true views on city brands based on the video behavior detection technology used in public places in the city. This article first divides behavior into individual behavior and group behavior and designs a very innovative behavior recognition algorithm for these two behaviors, of which speech recognition technology is a very powerful technology. In this article, the speech recognition technology is researched and applied to the rapid detection of video behavior in order to finally realize the application in city brand communication. The basis of research on speech recognition technology must be its algorithm, which is also the focus of this article, and how to improve the accuracy of speech recognition is the core issue of speech recognition technology. The experimental results show that if the sensitivity to voice signals can be increased, the accuracy of voice recognition can be greatly improved, and then the city brand can understand its own positioning. In this article, the three predicted coefficients: linear coefficient, linear cepstral coefficient and mel cepstrum coefficient are compared after the position of the endpoint is determined first, and finally, the mel frequency cepstral coefficient is selected to extract the characteristic parameters of the speech signal. The results show that the effect of this method is very good. Generally speaking, this article puts forward its own ideas on how to improve the communication effect of urban brands. Combined with the rapid detection technology of video behavior based on voice recognition technology, it puts forward new ideas on how urban brands are communicated. These views can provide city managers and city brand builders provide reference.

ID LOT-SIZING PROBLEM; DESIGN; ALGORITHM
AB Traditional mathematical models for supplier evaluation and selection have primarily focused on cost-oriented perspectives, neglecting non-cost factors such as strategic and relational measures. However, such models have often compromised the optimality of solutions. Additionally, the use of genetic algorithms in these models has resulted in similar objective function outputs with minimal differences, making it challenging to differentiate between potential suppliers. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that employs multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate suppliers without sacrificing optimality or imposing additional constraints. The proposed model utilizes hybrid algorithms and incorporates the weighted criteria obtained through the Best-Worst Method and the ranking and selection of alternatives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. By applying MCDM methods in the post-evaluation phase, this research introduces a unique approach that preserves solution optimality. The findings highlight that while the objective function outputs from the genetic algorithm implementations may be nearly identical, they can vary significantly across other criteria. This study demonstrates the strength of multi-criteria evaluation in overcoming the limitations of genetic algorithms without compromising solution optimality.

AB The barriers to implementing circular supply chains are well explored, but very little is provided to understand how these barriers play in public sector supply chains. Consequently, the role of digital technologies in addressing these barriers in the circularity of supply chains in the public sector remains a gap. Thus, this study bridges these gaps by evaluating digital technologies according to their relevance in addressing the identified barriers. In particular, eight domain experts who have sufficient knowledge and expertise in the domains of the public sector and circular economy were asked to elicit judgments in order to (1) set a threshold that defines the list of barriers that are significant to supply chains in the public sector, (2) obtain the priority weights of these barriers through the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), and (3) rank the identified digital technologies based on their relevance in addressing the identified barriers in public sector supply chains using combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) method, all under a Fermatean fuzzy set environment to account for epistemic uncertainties in judgment elicitation processes. This novel integration of the CRITIC and CODAS methods augmented by Fermatean fuzzy sets forms the methodological contribution of this work. Findings show that barriers associated with regulations restricting the collection of wastes, poor demand or acceptance for environmentally superior technologies, lack of expertise, technology, and information, operational risk, immature recycling technologies, and information sharing and communication were considered critical in managing circular public sector supply chains. The analysis also revealed that ripple effect modeling, simulation, and artificial intelligence are the priority digital technologies. These digital technologies offer efficiency and flexibility to decision-makers in analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios before the deployment of any circularity initiative, providing crucial information in its design and implementation. This paper outlines several managerial insights and offers possible agenda for future research.

AB In forensic practice, evaluating shoeprint evidence is challenging because the differences between images of two different outsoles can be subtle. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning-based matching algorithm called the Shoe-MS algorithm that quantifies the similarity between two outsole images. The Shoe-MS algorithm consists of a Siamese neural network for two input images followed by a transfer learning component to extract features from outsole impression images. The added layers are finely tuned using images of shoe soles. To test the performance of the method we propose, we use a study dataset that is both realistic and challenging. The pairs of images for which we know ground truth include (1) close non-matches and (2) mock-crime scene pairs. The Shoe-MS algorithm performed well in terms of prediction accuracy and was able to determine the source of pairs of outsole images, even when comparisons were challenging. When using a score-based likelihood ratio, the algorithm made the correct decision with high probability in a test of the hypothesis that images had a common source. An important advantage of the proposed approach is that pairs of images can be compared without alignment. In initial tests, Shoe-MS exhibited better-discriminating power than existing methods.

ID MODEL
AB We are witnessing the digitalization era, where artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) models are mandatory to transform this data deluge into actionable information. However, these models require large, high-quality datasets to predict high reliability/accuracy. Even with the maturity of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, there are still numerous scenarios where there is not enough quantity and quality of data to successfully develop AI/ML-based applications that can meet market expectations. One such scenario is precision agriculture, where operational data generation is costly and unreliable due to the extreme and remote conditions of numerous crops. In this paper, we investigated the generation of synthetic data as a method to improve predictions of AI/ML models in precision agriculture. We used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic temperature data for a greenhouse located in Murcia (Spain). The results reveal that the use of synthetic data significantly improves the accuracy of the AI/ML models targeted compared to using only ground truth data.

ID DESIGN
AB Digital twin, a core technology for intelligent manufacturing, has gained extensive research interest. The current research was mainly focused on digital twin based on design models representing ideal geometric features and behaviors at macroscopic scales, which is challenging to accurately represent accuracy and performance. However, a numerical representation is essential for precision microstructures whose accuracy and performance are difficult to measure. The concept of a digital twin for an accurate representation, proposed in 2015, is still in the conceptual stage without a clear construction method. Therefore, the goal of accurate representation has not been achieved. This paper defines the concept and connotation of an accuracy and performance-oriented accurate digital twin model and establishes its architecture in two levels: geometric and physical. First, a geometric digital twin model is constructed by the contact surfaces distributed error modeling and virtual assembly with nonuniform contact states. Then, based on this, a physical digital twin model is constructed by considering the linear and nonlinear response of the structural internal physical properties to the external environment and time to characterize the accuracy and performance variation. Finally, the models are evaluated. The method is validated on microtarget assembly. The estimated values of surface modeling, center offset, and stress prediction accuracy are 94.22%, 89.3%, and 83.27%. This paper provides a modeling methodology for the digital twin research to accurately represent accuracy and performance, which is critical for product quality improvements in intelligent manufacturing. Research results can be extended to larger-scale precision structures for performance prediction and optimization.

DT Article; Early Access
DE computational complexity; convolutional neural nets
AB Due to the large computational and GPUs memory cost of semantic segmentation, some works focus on designing a lite weight model to achieve a good trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. A common method is to combined CNN and vision transformer. However, these methods ignore the contextual information of multi receptive fields. And existing methods often fail to inject detailed information losses in the downsampling of multi-scale feature. To fix these issues, we propose AG Self-Attention, which is Enhanced Atrous Self-Attention (EASA), and Gate Attention. AG Self-Attention adds the contextual information of multi receptive fields into the global semantic feature. Specifically, the Enhanced Atrous Self-Attention uses weight shared atrous convolution with different atrous rates to get the contextual information under the specific different receptive fields. Gate Attention introduces gating mechanism to inject detailed information into the global semantic feature and filter detailed information by producing "fusion" gate and "update" gate. In order to prove our insight. We conduct numerous experiments in common semantic segmentation datasets, consisting of ADE20 K, COCO-stuff, PASCAL Context, Cityscapes, to show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and achieve a good trade-off between computational cost and accuracy.

AB COVID-19 has had a profound global impact, necessitating the development of infection detection systems based on machine learning. This paper presents a Multi-task architecture that addresses the classification and segmentation tasks for COVID-19 detection. The model comprises an encoder for feature representation, a decoder for segmentation, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. Evaluations conducted on two datasets demonstrate the model's performance in both classification and segmentation. To enhance efficiency and diagnosis accuracy, CT-scan images undergo pre-processing using image processing algorithms like histogram equalization, median filtering, and mathematical morphology operations. The combination of the median filter pre-processing and the proposed model yields impressive results in the classification task, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with values of 0.97, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively, for dataset 1, and 0.96 in mentioned metrics for dataset 2. For segmentation, the proposed model, particularly with the average morphology pre-processing, exhibits excellent performance with high accuracy, low mean squared error, high peak signal-to-noise ratio, high structural similarity index, and a mean dice coefficient of 88.86 & PLUSMN; 0.05 for dataset 1, and 87.97 & PLUSMN; 0.02 for dataset 2. Furthermore, the pre-trained models consistently demonstrate the superiority of the median filter and proposed model in the classification task on the same datasets. In conclusion, the proposed multi-task model, incorporating image processing techniques, achieves remarkable results in both classification and segmentation. The utilization of pre-processing algorithms and the multi-task framework significantly contribute to superior performance metrics. This study encourages further exploration of combining diverse image processing algorithms to advance infection diagnosis and treatment.

TI FRDet: Few-shot object detection via feature reconstruction

AB State-of-the-art object detection models rely on large-scale datasets for training to achieve good precision. Without sufficient samples, the model can suffer from severe overfitting. Current explorations in few-shot object detection are mainly divided into meta-learning-based methods and fine-tuning-based methods. However, existing models do not focus on how feature maps should be processed to present more accurate regions of interest (RoIs), leading to many non-supporting RoIs. These non-supporting RoIs can increase the burden of subsequent classification and even lead to misclassification. Additionally, catastrophic forgetting is inevitable in both few-shot object detection models. Many models classify directly in low-dimensional spaces due to insufficient resources, but this transformation of the data space can confuse some categories and lead to misclassification. To address these problems, the Feature Reconstruction Detector (FRDet) is proposed, a simple yet effective fine-tune-based approach for few-shot object detection. FRDet includes a region proposal network (RPN) based on channel attention and space attention called Multi-Attention RPN (MARPN) and a head based on feature reconstruction called Feature Reconstruction Head (FRHead). MARPN utilizes channel attention to suppress non-supporting classes and spatial attention to enhance support classes based on Attention RPN, resulting in fewer but more accurate RoIs. Meanwhile, FRHead utilizes support features to reconstruct query RoI features through a closed-form solution, allowing for a comprehensive and fine-grained comparison. The model was validated on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, FSOD, and CUB200 datasets and achieved better results.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; MUTATION STRATEGIES; OPTIMIZATION
AB The increasing complexity of real-world problems raises new challenges to evolutionary computation. Distributed models have been successfully employed by many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to deal with these challenges. In particular, distributed models provide a means to enable collaboration between multiple subpopulations, thus allowing the design of strategies to deal with premature convergence and loss of diversity, which are common problems in traditional evolutionary algorithms. Through introducing periodic migrations, many Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms (DEAs) have been proposed to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation. However, most of them focus on performing migrations at fixed or probabilistic intervals. In this work, we present a mechanism to estimate the moment of executing the migrations by assessing the loss of diversity of the subpopulations. Another relevant issue is that most studies choose to migrate the best or a random individual. We report a strategy that identifies a migrant individual capable of generating diversity that helps a given subpopulation explore non-visited regions without harming its health. The proposed approach uses an online clustering algorithm to create clouds of good fitness individuals that have been previously migrated. The solution to be migrated must be extracted from a cloud whose population distribution is sufficiently different from the population distribution of the original subpopulation. We called this approach a Diversity-driven Migration Strategy (DDMS). The efficiency of DDMS is experimentally compared against traditional migration strategies (fixed and probabilistic) on the CEC'2014 test suite. Considering the average error values for the objective function, the proposed approach is specially better in 50D and 100D (dimensional) instances. Regarding the diversity, the proposed strategy is better in 100% and about 96% of the test functions in 50D and 100D scenarios, respectively. In general, we have found the DDMS mechanisms to be of considerable benefit, especially in more complex problems such as the ones based on hybrid and composition objective functions.

AB Learning the graphical structure of Bayesian networks is key to describing data-generating mechanisms in many complex applications but poses considerable computational challenges. Observational data can only identify the equivalence class of the directed acyclic graph underlying a Bayesian network model, and a variety of methods exist to tackle the problem. Under certain assumptions, the popular PC algorithm can consistently recover the correct equivalence class by reverse-engineering the conditional independence (CI) relationships holding in the variable distribution. The dual PC algorithm is a novel scheme to carry out the CI tests within the PC algorithm by leveraging the inverse relationship between covariance and precision matrices. By exploiting block matrix inversions we can also perform tests on partial correlations of complementary (or dual) conditioning sets. The multiple CI tests of the dual PC algorithm proceed by first considering marginal and fullorder CI relationships and progressively moving to central-order ones. Simulation studies show that the dual PC algorithm outperforms the classic PC algorithm both in terms of run time and in recovering the underlying network structure, even in the presence of deviations from Gaussianity. Additionally, we show that the dual PC algorithm applies for Gaussian copula models, and demonstrate its performance in that setting.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID CALIBRATION
AB 6D object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous robot manipulation applications. The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are convolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture originally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving state -of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with the multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple single-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D object pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form for You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D pose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant of the YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We analyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that the object queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions. Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smaller sizes to train our model. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising computing paradigm in the context of 5G networks, as it enables the migration of workloads from User Equipments (UEs) to nearby MEC servers, thereby providing additional computing resources to UEs. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach to offloading decisions and resource allocation in a multi-user and multi-server MEC system, which operates in a time-varying environment. Our objective is to minimize the average task latency and discard rate under the constraints of latency and limited computing resources of the server. While traditional optimization methods have been used to solve computational offloading problems in static environments, these methods are not suitable for time-varying systems. Deep reinforcement learning can be an effective method for solving optimization problems in time-varying environments, as it can be used to adjust strategies in real-time in response to changes in the environment. However, the increased number of UEs in the system leads to a combinatorial increase in the number of possible actions, making it difficult for the algorithm to learn. To address this issue, we propose a multi-branch network based Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm called Branch Deep Q Network (BDQN), which modifies the action generation network into a multi-branch network structure, each branch generates one-dimensional action. This modification makes the number of network outputs increase linearly. Numerical results show that the BDQN algorithm outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of average task latency and discard rate.

AB With the increasing demand for efficient image dehazing solutions in computer vision algorithms, particularly for autonomous systems, a research focus on low-inference time yet high-performance dehazing techniques has emerged. Existing dehazing methods predominantly rely on either daytime or nighttime haze models, limiting their effectiveness in handling haziness under varying lighting conditions. To address this limitation, this research paper introduces the Light Invariant Dehazing Network (LIDN), an end-to-end image dehazing network consisting of four sub-modules: Feature Extractor, Deep Global Atmospheric Light Estimator, Medium Transmission Extractor, and Encoder-Decoder. The proposed model, trained using Quadruplet loss, effectively reduces artifacts and produces sharper dehazed images. Extensive experiments conducted under diverse lighting conditions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LIDN model compared to state-of-the-art daytime and nighttime dehazing approaches. Remarkably, the proposed model achieves these exceptional results with a runtime of only 0.24s per image, making it highly efficient than existing dehazing algorithms.

AB This study aims to develop a model that predicts high-frequency response spectra and damage-related ground motion parameters using low-frequency physics-based simulations (PBS) for horizontal and vertical components. The model is a stochastic dropout-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which accounts for spectra interdependencies and high-frequency spectra's stochastic nature. Adding anelastic distance as an input term significantly improved the model's performance. Models are developed for different cutoff periods (validity of PBS low-frequency spectra): 0.75 s, 1 s, 1.5 s, and 2 s, using the 2015 Nepal main and aftershocks and combining them with global near-source strong-motion data. The models are validated using near-and far-field predictions and a good agreement with the recorded data is observed. The mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination for the 0.75 s horizontal model is 0.174, 0.3171, and 0.9295, respectively. Additionally, the study generates spectra and time histories for the 2001 Mw 7.6 Bhuj earthquake, which had no recordings. The obtained spectral values agree well with global stable-continental region models, and the time histories could capture characteristics such as duration, amplitude, and arrival times.

AB This research proposes a hybrid improved marine predator algorithm (IMPA) and deep gated recurrent unit (DGRU) model for profit prediction in financial accounting information systems (FAIS). The study addresses the challenge of real-time processing performance caused by the increasing complexity of hybrid networks due to the growing size of datasets. To enable effective comparison, a new dataset is created using 15 input parameters from the original Chinese stock market Kaggle dataset. Additionally, five DGRU-based models are developed, including chaotic MPA (CMPA) and the nonlinear MPA (NMPA), as well as the best Levy-based variants, such as the dynamic Levy flight chimp optimization algorithm (DLFCHOA) and the Levy-base gray wolf optimization algorithm (LGWO). The results indicate that the most accurate model for profit forecasting among the tested algorithms is DGRU-IMPA, followed by DGRU-NMPA, DGRU-LGWO, DGRU-DLFCHOA, DGRU-CMPA, and traditional DGRU. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed hybrid model to improve profit prediction accuracy in FAIS, leading to enhanced decision-making and financial management.

AB This paper explores the concept of smart cities and the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) in realizing a data-centric smart environment. Smart cities leverage technology and data to improve the quality of life for citizens and enhance the efficiency of urban services. IoT and machine learning have emerged as key technologies for enabling smart city solutions that rely on large-scale data collection, analysis, and decision-making. This paper presents an overview of smart cities' various applications and discusses the challenges associated with implementing IoT and machine learning in urban environments. The paper also compares different case studies of successful smart city implementations utilizing IoT and machine learning technologies. The findings suggest that these technologies have the potential to transform urban environments and enable the creation of more livable, sustainable, and efficient cities. However, significant challenges remain regarding data privacy, security, and ethical considerations, which must be addressed to realize the full potential of smart cities.

TI Cross-modal knowledge guided model for abstractive summarization
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB ive summarization (AS) aims to generate more flexible and informative descriptions than extractive summarization. Nevertheless, it often distorts or fabricates facts in the original article. To address this problem, some existing approaches attempt to evaluate or verify factual consistency, or design models to reduce factual errors. However, most of the efforts either have limited effects or result in lower rouge scores while reducing factual errors. In other words, it is challenging to promote factual consistency while maintaining the informativeness of generated summaries. Inspired by the knowledge graph embedding technique, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal knowledge guided model (CKGM) for AS, which embeds a multimodal knowledge graph (MKG) combining image entity-relationship information and textual factual information (FI) into BERT to accomplish cross-modal information interaction and knowledge expansion. The pre-training method obtains rich contextual semantic information, while the knowledge graph supplements the textual information. In addition, an entity memory embedding algorithm is further proposed to improve information fusion efficiency and model training speed. We elaborately conducted ablation experiments and evaluated our model on the Visual Genome, FewRel, MSCOCO, and CNN/DailyMail datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the FI consistency and informativeness of generated summaries.

DE Implicit intent; Prompt learning; Deep semantics; CIID
AB As one of the core modules of the dialogue system, intent recognition plays an important role in human-computer interaction. Most of the existing intent recognition research is limited to simple, direct, and explicit intent recognitions. However, the natural human-computer interactions are flexible and diverse, and the expressions are often the euphemistic implicit intentions. Therefore, the implicit intent recognition brings new research challenges in this field. This paper pioneers a Chinese Implicit Intent Dataset (CIID), which covers seven common intents from different fields, and the data is the text containing the user's implicit intent. Based on this corpus, it is the first-time the prompt learning is employed for implicit intent recognition and by constructing a suitable prompt template so that the model can get "relevant hints" to dig out the true intention of the user. We also evaluate a range of classification models on CIID dataset in this study. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the performance of the model with few-shot settings, the results also prove that the proposed method is advanced and robust.

ID INFERENCE
AB A high reliability system has the characteristics of complexity, modularization, high cost and small sample size. Throughout the entire lifecycle of system development, storage and use, the high reliability requirements and the risk analysis form a direct contradiction with the testing expenses. In order to ensure the system, module or component maintains good reliability status and effectively reduces the cost of sampling tests, it is necessary to make full use of multi-source prior information to evaluate its reliability. Therefore, in order to evaluate the reliability of highly reliable equipment under the condition of a small sample size correctly, the equipment reliability evaluation model should be built based on multi-source prior information and form scientific computing methods to meet the needs of condition evaluation and fund assurance of high reliability system. In engineering practice, high reliability system or module gradually develops from normal state to failure state, generally going through three working states of "safety-potential failure-functional failure". Firstly, the historical test data under the three states can be used for the data source for the reliability evaluation of the system at the current stage, which supplements the deficiency of the field data; secondly, due to the lack of accurate judgment on the working state of a high reliability system or modules and analysis of the health status, the unnecessary maintenance may aggravate the evolution speed from potential failure to functional failure; thirdly, when high reliability system or module operates under overload or harsh conditions, the potential failure will be worsened to a certain extent. Aiming at the difficulty of multi-state system reliability evaluation, a reliability evaluation method based on non -information prior distribution is proposed by fusing multi-source prior information, which provides ideas and methods for reliability evaluation and optimization analysis of high reliability system or module. The results show that the three-state reliability evaluation method proposed in this article is consistent with the actual engineering situation, providing a scientific theoretical basis for preventive maintenance of high reliability system. At the same time, the research method not only helps evaluate the reliability state of a high reliability system accurately, but also achieves the goal of effectively reducing test costs with good economic benefits and engineering application value.

AB The government does have to record and analyze the travel trajectories of urban residents aiming to effectively control the epidemic during COVID-19. However, these privacy-related data are usually stored in centralized cloud databases, which are prone to be vulnerable to cyber attacks leading to personal trajectory information leakage. In this article, we proposed a novel secure sharing and storing method of personal travel trajectory data based on BC and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). We adopt the Hyperledger Fabric, the representative of Federated BC framework, combined with the IPFS storage to form a novel mode of querying on-chain and storing off-chain aiming to both achieve the effectiveness of data processing and protect personal privacy-related information. This method firstly solves the efficiency problem of traditional public BC and ensures the security of stored data by storing the ciphertext of complete personal travel trajectory data in decentralized IPFS storage. Secondly, considering the huge amount of information of residents' travel trajectories, the method proposed in this article can obtain the complete information under the chain stored in IPFS by querying the index on the chain, which significantly improves the data processing efficiency of residents' travel trajectories and thus promotes the effective control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed solution is verified through performance evaluation and security analysis.

AB This research study proposes a unique framework that takes input from a surface electromyogram (sEMG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) bio-signals. These signals are trained using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The framework entails a real-time neuro-machine interface to decode the human intention of upper limb motions. The bio-signals from the two modalities are recorded for eight movements simultaneously for prosthetic arm functions focusing on trans-humeral amputees. The fNIRS signals are acquired from the human motor cortex, while sEMG is recorded from the human bicep muscles. The selected classification and command generation features are the peak, minimum, and mean & UDelta;HbO and & UDelta;HbR values within a 2-s moving window. In the case of sEMG, wavelength, peak, and mean were extracted with a 150-ms moving window. It was found that this scheme generates eight motions with an enhanced average accuracy of 94.5%. The obtained results validate the adopted research methodology and potential for future real-time neural-machine interfaces to control prosthetic arms.

AB Object search is a basic and necessary task for household robots to perform home services. However, due to the complexity and dynamics in home environment, some target objects can hardly be observed in the first place, reducing the efficiency of object search. For human beings, target objects can always be associated with relevant but obvious objects, or room categories, and these kinds of information may provide a guidance on helping robots locate target objects more quickly and accurately. In order to simulate this process, this article proposes a hierarchical semantic knowledge based object search method. Firstly, semantic knowledge is constructed by modelling the (room category, environmental object, dynamic object) relationship in natural languages related to home services. Secondly, to deal with information loss caused by the ambiguity in natural language, a priori knowledge identifying the relationship between room categories and environmental objects is constructed for further completing the semantic knowledge. After that, the rules for knowledge deployment and updating are presented to increase the practical value of the semantic knowledge. Finally, a heuristic object search strategy based on the semantic knowledge is proposed to guide the robot on locating the target object efficiently and quickly. In order to make the strategy stable and adaptable, the room layout and the distance between the robot and the candidate room are also taken into consideration. Our method is tested in both the simulated and real environments, and the results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively assist the robots on locating the target object with less time cost and shorter path length.

DE Multiple kernel clustering (MKC); multiple kernel learning
AB Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) aims to learn an optimal kernel to better serve for clustering from several precomputed basic kernels. Most MKC algorithms adhere to a common assumption that an optimal kernel is linearly combined by basic kernels. Based on a min-max framework, a newly proposed MKC method termed simple multiple kernel k-means (SimpleMKKM) can acquire a high-quality unified kernel. Although SimpleMKKM has achieved promising clustering performance, we observe that it cannot benefit from any prior knowledge. This would cause the learned partition matrix may seriously deviate from the expected one, especially in clustering tasks where the ground truth is absent during the learning course. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel algorithm termed regularized simple multiple kernel k-means with kernel average alignment (R-SMKKM-KAA). According to the experimental results of existing MKC algorithms, the average partition is a strong baseline to reflect true clustering. To gain knowledge from the average partition, we add the average alignment as a regularization term to prevent the learned unified partition from being far from the average partition. After that, we have designed an efficient solving algorithm to optimize the new resulting problem. In this way, both the incorporated prior knowledge and the combination of basic kernels are helpful to learn better unified partition. Consequently, the clustering performance can be significantly improved. Extensive experiments on nine common datasets have sufficiently demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporation of prior knowledge into SimpleMKKM.

TI Resolution enhancement with a task-assisted GAN to guide optical
   nanoscopy image analysis and acquisition
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEGMENTATION
AB Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods enable the characterization of nanostructures in living and fixed biological tissues. However, they require the adjustment of multiple imaging parameters while attempting to satisfy conflicting objectives, such as maximizing spatial and temporal resolution while minimizing light exposure. To overcome the limitations imposed by these trade-offs, post-acquisition algorithmic approaches have been proposed for resolution enhancement and image-quality improvement. Here we introduce the task-assisted generative adversarial network (TA-GAN), which incorporates an auxiliary task (for example, segmentation, localization) closely related to the observed biological nanostructure characterization. We evaluate how the TA-GAN improves generative accuracy over unassisted methods, using images acquired with different modalities such as confocal, bright-field, stimulated emission depletion and structured illumination microscopy. The TA-GAN is incorporated directly into the acquisition pipeline of the microscope to predict the nanometric content of the field of view without requiring the acquisition of a super-resolved image. This information is used to automatically select the imaging modality and regions of interest, optimizing the acquisition sequence by reducing light exposure. Data-driven microscopy methods like the TA-GAN will enable the observation of dynamic molecular processes with spatial and temporal resolutions that surpass the limits currently imposed by the trade-offs constraining super-resolution microscopy.
   Algorithmic super-resolution in the context of fluorescence microscopy is challenging due to the difficulty to reliably represent biological nanostructures in synthetically generated images. Bouchard and colleagues propose a deep learning model for live-cell imaging that can leverage auxiliary microscopy imaging tasks to guide and enhance reconstruction, while preserving the biological features of interest.

TI Explaining machine learning models with interactive natural language
   conversations using TalkToModel
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

ID EXPLANATIONS
AB To ensure that a machine learning model has learned the intended features, it can be useful to have an explanation of why a specific output was given. Slack et al. have created a conversational environment, based on language models and feature importance, which can interactively explore explanations with questions asked in natural language.
   Practitioners increasingly use machine learning (ML) models, yet models have become more complex and harder to understand. To understand complex models, researchers have proposed techniques to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use explainability methods because they do not know which explanation to choose and how to interpret the explanation. Here we address the challenge of using explainability methods by proposing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system that explains ML models through natural language conversations. TalkToModel consists of three components: an adaptive dialogue engine that interprets natural language and generates meaningful responses; an execution component that constructs the explanations used in the conversation; and a conversational interface. In real-world evaluations, 73% of healthcare workers agreed they would use TalkToModel over existing systems for understanding a disease prediction model, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel was easier to use, demonstrating that TalkToModel is highly effective for model explainability.

AB This paper presents a novel healthcare services framework that leverages versatile distributed computing and mobile cloud computing to enhance the delivery of medical care data. The framework is designed to integrate with diverse cloud settings and distributed computing resources, utilizing a Virtual-Dedicated-Server with 5 VCPU and 32 GB storage of RAM to develop a prototype specifically tailored for stroke patients with cardioembolic and cryptogenic subtypes, using Android-based mobile phones as the primary devices. The proposed framework consists of two fundamental application components: flexible usage and server request. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module, the system effectively distinguishes between the two-stroke subtypes. Simultaneously, the server application securely stores patient data, ensuring accessibility, security, and adaptability for stroke patients. The CNN module performs computations using the Stroke dataset, providing valuable insights into subtype classification. Additionally, the GBRF (Gradient boosting random forest) algorithm has been employed for further analysis and accurate predictive modeling within the healthcare system. The research contributions of this work are significant. Firstly, it introduces a unique healthcare mechanism that harnesses the potential of distributed computing and mobile cloud computing in improving healthcare services. Secondly, the paper verifies the exceptional value of stroke-related data collected through smartphones, underscoring the uniqueness and reliability of such data sources. Lastly, the system enables the provision of health status information to patients through a CNN application programming interface (API), facilitating seamless communication and personalized healthcare services. By integrating machine intelligence based technologies, the framework enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of stroke identification and contributing to the overall well-being of patients in a meaningful way.

AB This paper proposes an enhancement to the Harris' Hawks Optimisation (HHO) algorithm. Firstly, an enhanced HHO (EHHO) model is developed to solve single-objective optimisation problems (SOPs). EHHO is then further extended to a multi-objective EHHO (MO-EHHO) model to solve multi-objective optimisation problems (MOPs). In EHHO, a nonlinear exploration factor is formulated to replace the original linear exploration method, which improves the exploration capability and facilitate the transition from exploration to exploitation. In addition, the Differential Evolution (DE) scheme is incorporated into EHHO to generate diverse individuals. To replace the DE mutation factor, a chaos strategy that increases randomness to cover wider search areas is adopted. The non-dominated sorting method with the crowding distance is leveraged in MO-EHHO, while a mutation mechanism is employed to increase the diversity of individuals in the external archive for addressing MOPs. Benchmark SOPs and MOPs are used to evaluate EHHO and MO-EHHO models, respectively. The sign test is employed to ascertain the performance of EHHO and MO-EHHO from the statistical perspective. Based on the average ranking method, EHHO and MO-EHHO indicate their efficacy in tackling SOPs and MOPs, as compared with those from the original HHO algorithm, its variants, and many other established evolutionary algorithms.

   algorithm; Markov chain rule; Content-based image retrieval
AB Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems use a group of preset and predefined parameters for their configuration. However, in machine learning methods, feature selection is a preprocessing step. Framework designed for feature selection considers feature subsets of datasets as a node and edges as a customized relation between features. However, most feature selection strategies are ineffective when dealing with diverse and inhomogeneous data. Therefore, Markov chain rule-based feature selection technique has been proposed for handling all kinds of data. The novelty of work is that a feature selection algorithm-based probabilistic latent network has been proposed, which will consider all subsets of features as a pathway on an undirected graph. Such kind of pathways is possible during ranking phase on a graph, which will effectively avoid the combinatorial problem. At last, Gradient Boosting Algorithm was applied to classify the features. The suggested work's main contribution is identifying the relevance. Results have been compared for different clustering techniques along with different machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree and KNN and proposed technique have got better results with Fuzzy C mean and used it for further feature optimization along with gradient boosting Algorithm. We have evaluated the results using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Web-Crawled misc 1 and Web-Crawled misc 2 datasets. The highest accuracy levels of 98% for CIFAR-10, 98.24% for CIFAR-100, 98.05, 97.87% for Web-crawled misc 1, and 97.4% for Web-crawled misc 1, respectively, have been achieved using the proposed model.

AB As a powerful soft computing tool, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been successfully employed for time-series modeling and forecasting problems. However, both the rapid time variation and the trends are still open problems when processing univariate non-stationary time-series forecasting problems via FCM-based models. In this paper, we propose a time-series forecasting model by composing FCMs, gated recurrent unit network (GRU), and autoencoder network (AE). The model is termed GAE-FCM. Firstly, a scheme based on gated recurrent unit networks and autoencoder networks is designed to learn the potential representations and capture the long-term trend of non-stationary time series while decomposing these univariate time series into a group of multivariate feature vectors. Then, the obtained multivariate feature vectors are modeled as a fuzzy cognitive map in which quantifying its connection matrix is regarded as a convex optimization problem. Finally, the time-series trend is predicted by the optimized fuzzy cognitive map and corresponding modeling mechanism. The performance of the proposed model has been validated by comparison with several representative methods on five non-stationary time-series datasets.

AB In recent years, yoga has become a part of daily exercise, and there is an increased need for yoga instructors. Improper yoga poses may cause serious effects and harmful consequences with ineffectual benefits. Therefore, it is vital to learn yoga poses correctly with a proper instructor. Recently, many existing methods can substitute the instructor, and such techniques classify and provide the effective cost of yoga. However, such models cannot detect yoga poses and classify them in an image due to several constraints, such as illumination variation, resolution of the image and clothing deviations. To bridge this gap, this article presents an effectual mechanism for yoga pose classification utilizing Remora Lion Algorithm (RLA)-based Convolutional Neural network (CNN) with Transfer Learning (TL). Here, trained models are AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, Xception, MobileNet-v2, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet-b0, SqueezeNet, and GoogleNet trained CNN. Moreover, the proposed RLA is devised by integrating Remora Optimization Algorithm (ROA) and Lion Algorithm (LA). Meanwhile, the proposed RLA-based CNN + TL has obtained high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, low CV ratio and high ROC value of 0.9943 with measures of 0.944, 0.957, 0.937 and 4.554, respectively.

AB In the aspect of vascular segmentation detection, medical image detection technology can automatically identify and segment vascular areas through the processing and analysis of vascular images, helping doctors to complete preliminary image recognition and diagnosis. To investigate the effect of endovascular angioplasty combined with beraprost sodium in the treatment of early thrombosis of artificial vascular arteriovenous fistula and its effect on the levels of Apelin-13 and CCL-21, the serum Apelin-13 and CCL-21 levels and clinical efficacy were compared. After treatment Apelin-13 in the research group (25.14 & PLUSMN; 3.52) and CCL-21 (71.25 & PLUSMN; 11.61) were significantly different from those of the control group in Apelin-13 (32.06 & PLUSMN; 5.13) and CCL-21 (85.18 & PLUSMN; 7.33) (F = 4.14, 6.20, P < 0.05). After treatment, the research group PT (10.20 & PLUSMN; 1.61), APTT (28.20 & PLUSMN; 2.30), FIB (2.20 & PLUSMN; 1.10), TT (13.20 & PLUSMN; 2.10) compared with the control group PT (12.51 & PLUSMN; 3.80), APTT (33.80 & PLUSMN; 3.40), FIB (4.60 & PLUSMN; 2.30), TT (16.20 & PLUSMN; 1.70), the difference was significant. Endovascular angioplasty has a significant clinical effect in the treatment of early thrombosis of artificial vascular arteriovenous fistula. Postoperative treatment with beraprost sodium improves the coagulation function of patients, reduces the levels of Apelin-13 and CCL-21, and promotes the recovery of patients, which is worthy of clinical research. The application of medical image detection technology can greatly reduce the workload of doctors and improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, which is of great significance for improving the quality and efficiency of medical services.

AB Soft magnetic manipulators offer the prospect of improved surgical outcomes through their potential for miniaturization and inherently safe tissue interaction. However, independent actuation of multiple manipulators within the same confined workspace is limited by undesired simultaneous actuation and manipulator-manipulator interactions. Herein, for the first time, approaches for the independent magnetic actuation of two magnetic continuum manipulators within the same confined workspace are proposed. A novel modular magnetic soft robot segment design is proposed with modified geometry to provide preferential bending planes and high angles of deflection. This design is integrated into two dual-segment magnetic manipulators which, when arranged in parallel, can deliver independent bending in two planes of motion. Two distinct independent control strategies are proposed, based on orthogonal manipulator magnetization profiles and local field gradient control, respectively. Each dual-manipulator configuration is characterized over a sequence of applied magnetic fields and gradients, induced via a dual robotically controlled external permanent magnet system. Manipulator independence, bending range of motion, and twisting behaviors are evaluated as a function of control strategy and manipulator separation distance. To demonstrate the system's potential in clinical scenarios, a dual-manipulator configuration is adapted to carry an endoscopic camera and optic fiber, respectively. The resultant bimanual system is deployed in the confined anatomy of a skull-base phantom to simulate minimally invasive ablation of a pituitary adenoma. Independent motion of the camera and tool within the confined workspace demonstrate the potential for an independent magnetic tool manipulation for surgical applications.

AB In recent years, multi-task learning (MTL) has become a popular field in machine learning and has a key role in various domains. Sharing knowledge across tasks in MTL can improve the performance of learning algorithms and enhance their generalization capability. A new approach called the multi-task least squares twin support vector machine (MTLS-TSVM) was recently proposed as a least squares variant of the direct multi-task twin support vector machine (DMTSVM). Unlike DMTSVM, which solves two quadratic programming problems, MTLS-TSVM solves two linear systems of equations, resulting in a reduced computational time. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of MTLS-TSVM called the improved multi-task least squares twin support vector machine (IMTLS-TSVM). IMTLS-TSVM offers a significant advantage over MTLS-TSVM by operating based on the empirical risk minimization principle, which allows for better generalization performance. The model achieves this by including regularization terms in its objective function, which helps control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMTLS-TSVM by comparing it to several single-task and multi-task learning algorithms on various real-world data sets. Our results highlight the superior performance of IMTLS-TSVM in addressing multi-task learning problems.

   learning; Attention
AB Most anchor-free object detectors suffer from intersample imbalance, underutilization of multiscale features and long training times in traffic object dataset. As a result, the efficiency and accuracy of the detector may be significantly reduced for samples with few categories and small sizes. To address these problems, we propose a novel anchor-free approach, namely, GSA-DLA34, which is based on Gaussian kernel, sample weights, and attention. Its features are as follows. First, pyramid squeeze attention (PSA) is added after the backbone network to enhance multiscale traffic object representations. Second, for better object positioning with few categories and small scales, we design active sample weights for regression loss to make better information use. In addition, an elliptical Gaussian sampling module (EGSM) with a controllable Gaussian kernel shape is incorporated into the classification and regression branches to accelerate network training. The results show that our GSA-DLA34 has a significant advantage in balancing training time, inference speed, and accuracy. With an average precision of 89% on the PASCAL VOC dataset and an inference speed of 55.2 FPS on the RTX 2080 Ti, the GSA-DLA34 method can significantly improve human-vehicle recognition accuracy.

AB People are associated with multiple social networks to enjoy the exclusive services provided by each. Such users may be well established in some networks but relatively new to others. In order to find their potential connections in any newly entered network, their already existing rich interactions in the neworks where they are well-established can be utilized. We consider two such heterogeneous bibliographic networks where there are common users and propose a novel, event-based embedding algorithm called ABHENE (Alignment Based HEterogeneous Network Embedding) using CNN and transfer learning to construct a target network in a low-dimensional space based on its aligned counterpart. This procedure is repeated for various time slots and the target networks so obtained are fed into an LSTM framework to produce an embedded target network at a future point in time. Using this projected network, the future links among various nodes are predicted. We compare ABHENE with other embedding methods and, from such analysis, it has been found that ABHENE outperforms all its counterparts. Ours is the first work to consider network alignment and link prediction across heterogeneous aligned dynamic social networks. The performance of our link prediction method too surpasses those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results highlight the fact that enhanced performance can be achieved by the inclusion of heterogeneity and dynamism in the prediction of future links in partially aligned social networks.

ID FACE RECOGNITION
AB Three-valued reasoning or three-way decision modelling theory (3WD) offers a natural, human-intuitive method for dealing with uncertainty. Rough set theory is a paradigm which mimics 3WD by providing a set of concepts which broadly reflect the three different modelling scenarios; certainty, uncertainty and exclusion. A further development known as decision-theoretic rough sets utilises a neighbourhood relation to partition the universe and offers further flexibility in the framing of 3WD by allowing for a probabilistic extension to rough sets. However, the traditional approach to discovering the neighbourhood is based upon one-to-one metrics which suffer from some inherent weaknesses, such as ignoring some holistic information including data distribution and class structure. In order to address this shortcoming and improve existing 3WD classification models, this paper proposes a linear reconstruction neighbourhood membership and associated representation-based decision-theoretic rough set (RDTRS) approach in order to implement 3WD classification. The work employs a linear reconstruction metric (LRM), which is a one-to-many mapping. This allows the exploration of inherent geometric similarities and the complete consideration of the neighbourhood relationships of objects. LRM can be deemed a hybrid approach, since it has the ability to reflect both the distribution of the training objects and the significance of objects in constructing the representation subspace. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of this novel RDTRS technique harnesses the representation power of 3WD classification and results in improved classification performance for both benchmark and face image datasets.

AB Accounts receivable management has always been an important part of the financial management of the financial sharing center. However, due to manual operation, problems like long working hours, uncontrollable errors and low efficiency of invoicing still exist. To solve this problem, we study K-means clustering method to grade customer credit, and use BP model to improve the clustering algorithm. Then, we study BP model to establish enterprise risk prediction model. Finally, we use RPA to make the billing process and reconciliation as well as write-off process optimized in accounts receivable. Through the above operations, an optimized model of account receivable management of e-commerce enterprises based on big data intelligent technology has been built. According to experimental analysis, the accuracy rate of risk prediction of e-commerce enterprise A is 95.63%. After applying the optimized management model, the ratio of accounts receivable balance to current assets has decreased from 34.3% to 28.5%. Studying and constructing models can effectively optimize corporate financial management and play a positive role in the stable development of enterprises. Applying this model to practical teaching can bring new vitality to the practical teaching of vocational education and provide new teaching methods for schools. The limitations of traditional accounts receivable management limit the effectiveness of teaching for financial students. This model effectively optimizes the management mode and brings more skilled knowledge to students.

   Ranking fuzzy numbers
ID SETS
AB Real-world problems often deal with uncertainties related to imprecision and vagueness, for which fuzzy modeling has provided a successful approach. Ranking fuzzy numbers is a necessary and complex task in multiple processes, such as decision making. To facilitate the task of ranking fuzzy numbers, it has been introduced an approach to construct fuzzy distances from classical interval distances because their a-cuts are continuous intervals. Usually, extant interval distances use interval endpoints or midpoints, leading to results that might not reflect the correct distance because of information loss. This paper introduces a new fuzzy distance based on a novel interval distance that considers all points within the intervals by using the concept of integration to calculate the average distance between all points belonging to two intervals, respectively. Subsequently, a series of distances between fuzzy numbers based on the proposed interval distances are defined and proved. A new method for ranking fuzzy numbers using the new fuzzy distances is then presented. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed distances will be demonstrated by a comparative analysis of numerical examples.

AB This paper focuses on the adaptive fuzzy self-triggered tracking controller design for full-state constrained multiple-input and multiple-output nonlinear systems. The implementation of the control scheme is categorized into three steps: (1) restricting the states to satisfy the corresponding constraints; (2) handling the explosion of complexity; and (3) achieving a better compromise between system performances and communication loads. First, tangent barrier Lyapunov functions are applied to constrain the outputs and system states within time-varying boundaries. Then, the explosion of complexity is addressed via the command filtering method. Furthermore, an adaptive self-triggered control mechanism is developed to reduce resource consumption for each subsystem. In addition to solving the problem of monitoring the triggering threshold continuously, the designed adaptive self-triggered mechanism allows the triggering intervals to be dynamically adjusted according to the tracking errors, which makes the proposed control protocol possible to coordinate the system performances and communication resources. By using the Lyapunov stability criterion, it is demonstrated that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

AB Accurate segmentation of the skin lesion region is crucial for diagnosing and screening skin diseases. However, skin lesion segmentation is challenging due to the indistinguishable boundaries of the lesion region, irregular shapes and hair interference. To settle the above issues, we propose a Multi-scale Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network for skin lesion segmentation named MDSC-Net. Specifically, a novel Multi-scale Depthwise Separable Residual Convolution Module is employed in skip connection, conveying more detailed features to the decoder. To compensate for the loss of spatial location information in down-sampling, we propose a novel Spatial Adaption Module. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-scale Decoding Fusion Module in the decoder to capture contextual information. We have performed extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed network on three public benchmark skin lesion segmentation datasets and one public benchmark polyp segmentation dataset, including ISIC-2017, ISIC-2018, PH2, and Kvasir-SEG datasets. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the proposed MDSC-Net achieves superior segmentation across five popularly used evaluation criteria. The proposed network reaches high-performance skin lesion segmentation, and can provide important clues to help doctors diagnose and treat skin cancer early.

ID JOINT PRODUCTION; DESIGN; COMPONENTS; SYSTEMS
AB The simultaneous regulation of production efficiency and equipment maintenance in intelligent production lines poses a challenging problem. Existing approaches addressing this issue often separate the regulation of equipment maintenance and load balancing, lacking dynamic indicators to characterize the operational status and equipment workload. Inspired by the cardiac electrical activity recorded from human electrocardiogram (ECG), the electric drive signal of the equipment is proposed as an analogous measure to monitor equipment performance and workload variations. Thereby, the implementation mechanism and working characteristics of equipment ECG (EECG) are put forward for reconfigurable mixed-model assembly. Moreover, the monitoring of equipment performance based on deep learning is explored, leveraging the EECG features combined with multi-source heterogeneous data. The variations of equipment workload are tracked through the construction of a population difference hash analysis of the ECG data flow, along with the characterization of equipment power through electric signals. Additionally, an EECG-driven synchronous mapping approach is proposed to address steady disturbance, considering both workload imbalance and the degeneracy effect of the equipment. The reconfigurability of the intelligent production line enables the proposed mechanism of similarity matching of EECG features through the reconfiguration of the software manufacturing system and hardware physical equipment. Finally, the EECG-based solution is validated on a laboratory-level prototype platform, demonstrating that the robust running of the assembly process can be ensured even in the presence of internal and external disturbances.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Image super-resolution; Unpaired data; Generative adversarial network;
   Adaptive weighting
AB Existing deep learning-based image super-resolution (SR) algorithms have made great achievements on synthetic LR-HR pairs in a fully supervised manner. However, the real image degradation process is complicated and unclear, leading to a domain gap between the synthetic LR images and real LR images. To address this issue, the most widely used alternatives are GAN-based methods trained with unpaired data. But most GAN-based methods tend to follow complex multi-stage pipelines and still suffer from the vast cost of hyperparameter tuning on the loss function. In this paper, in contrast to complicated two-stage or multi-stage GAN, a straightforward and simple one-stage GAN-based framework is proposed. Different from the current one-stage GAN, our approach exclusively fits the CycleGAN pattern without any other restrictions, fully leveraging images from unpaired datasets. Specifically, our framework consists of a DegradeNet and an SRNet, which implicitly models the degradation and SR process between the source LR domain and target HR domain. Such a simple one-stage GAN allows us to flexibly learn the data distribution without any assumptions, greatly reducing the model complexity and training difficulty. To further address the inherent practice of empirically setting hyperparameters in previous methods, we propose an adaptive weighting network to automatically learn the contribution weights of different losses in a meta-learning manner. This flexible strategy could shorten the gap between various losses and meanwhile help the model to adaptively optimize in an efficient way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of indicators and perceptual quality.

AB Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most efficient evolution algorithms (ES) for dealing with nonlinear, complicated and difficult global optimization problems. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized in three directions: Firstly, a novel crossover rate (CR) generation scheme based on the zscore value of fitness, named fcr, is introduced. For a minimization problem, the proposed CR generation strategy always assigns a smaller CR value to individual with smaller fitness value. Therefore, the parameters of individuals with better fitness are inherited by their offspring with high probability. In the second direction, the control parameters are adjusted by unused bimodal settings in which each parameter setting is selected according to the evolution status of individual. The third direction of our work is introducing the L1 norm distance as the weights for updating the mean value of crossover rate and scale factor. Theoretically, compared with L2 norm, L1-norm is more efficient to suppress outliers in the difference vector. These modifications are first integrated with the mutation strategy of JADE, then a modified version, named JADEfcr, is proposed. In addition, to improve the optimization ability further, another variant LJADEfcr by using a linear population reduction mechanism is considered. So as to confirm and examine the performance of JADEfcr and LJADEfcr, numerical experiments are conducted on 29 optimization problems defined by CEC2017 benchmark. For JADEfcr, its experimental results are made a comparison with twelve state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparative study demonstrates that in terms of robustness, stability and solution quality, JADEfcr are better and highly competitive with these well-known algorithms. For LJADEfcr, its results are compared with JADEfcr and other nine powerful algorithms including four recent algorithms and five top algorithms on CEC2017 competition. Experimental results indicate that LJADEfcr is superior and statistically competitive with these excellent algorithms in terms of robustness, stability and the quality of the obtained solutions.

TI Blind Image Quality Assessment via Multiperspective Consistency
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has made significant progress, but it remains a challenging problem due to the wide variation in image content and the diverse nature of distortions. To address these challenges and improve the adaptability of BIQA algorithms to different image contents and distortions, we propose a novel model that incorporates multiperspective consistency. Our approach introduces a multiperspective strategy to extract features from various viewpoints, enabling us to capture more beneficial cues from the image content. To map the extracted features to a scalar score, we employ a content-aware hypernetwork architecture. Additionally, we integrate all perspectives by introducing a consistency supervision strategy, which leverages cues from each perspective and enforces a learning consistency constraint between them. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on five representative datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both authentic and synthetic distortion image databases. Furthermore, our approach exhibits excellent generalization ability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gn-share/multi-perspective.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in the working environment which shifted the type of systems thinking skills needed for practitioners. These changes include the utilization of a digitalized work environment. To reliably assess practitioners' systems thinking (ST) skills/abilities in a digitalized environment, such as the case of COVID-19, we propose an evaluation approach based on the hybrid weight determination and extended VIKOR model to assess the systems skills of practitioners concerning 7-dimensions of systems thinking. The proposed methodology consists of three phases: the first phase uses a rough set theory to process the assessment data of candidates' systems thinking skills, the ideal interval references of seven systems thinking skills criteria (7-dimension) of practitioners required by an organization is extracted. The second phase is to build a comprehensive weight solution model based on BWM (best-worst method) and entropy weight method (EWM) and analyze the employer's needs under each systems thinking skills dimension. The third phase is to build a new group utility index based on the weight and digital reference and form an extended Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (E-VIKOR) model to complete the prioritization of practitioners' systems thinking skillset. A case study containing 108 practitioners is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making model and carry out sensitivity analysis and methods comparison. The results show that the proposed model provides more reliable and robust results for selecting the most appropriate practitioner for the required digitalized job requirements.

AB A facial expression recognition system has been proposed in this paper. The challenges of the facial expression recognition system lie due to low intra-class variance within a class of negative emotions, such as anger, disgust, and fear. A conventional Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model may extract discriminative features and has shown outstanding performance in various computer vision tasks. However, it is unable to extract the secondorder feature information that demonstrates the interaction between features in the image of wildenvironment datasets. This paper presents a novel method to solve the facial expression recognition problem by addressing several limitations concerning emotion recognition problems. A deep learning-based bilinear convolutional neural network framework has been proposed, termed an Fine-Grained Bilinear CNN (FgbCNN) model that consists of two branches with optimized CNN along with a normalization layer composed of batchnormalization, square-root normalization, L2-normalization, and drop-out layers. Here, local and holistic features have been aggregated using a dot-product layer to extract more discriminant features. Finally, experimenting with two wild-environments (SFEW 1.0 and SFEW 2.0) and two lab-controlled datasets (KDEF and CK+), it has been observed that the proposed model can minimize the intra-class variances and has attained outstanding performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) are commonly used tools for medical diagnostic assessment. Considering the ionizing radiation of CT imaging, estimating CT images from radiation-free MRI would be beneficial for medical diagnosis. Although state-of-art generative adversarial networks or end-to-end architecture models can generate realistic natural images, it is challenging to generate medical CT images with high signal-to-noise ratios and are paired with MRI. We propose a histogram-driven generative adversarial network (HisGAN) to address this issue, estimate CT images paired with MR, and develop a histogram-based dynamic scaling factor to facilitate learning different image styles. By employing an adversarial learning strategy to train the end-to -end generator, the generator better simulate the nonlinear mapping from source to target. For the generator, the proposed method applies multiple learnable parameters to adjust the overall weights of the dilated convolution layers to ensure sufficient expansive receptive fields for improved performance. Additionally, the method utilizes deep residual networks to train randomly smoothed generated images and employs adversarial loss to enhance the generation of the discriminator, achieving a balance between the generator and the discriminator. Our approach can synthesize image details at the pixel level in the target domain and has been evaluated using two datasets for MR to CT, T1 to T2, and Flair to T1ce modality synthesis tasks. The proposed method outperforms existing generative adversarial models applied to medical image synthesis. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the rapid development in the field of marine exploration, underwater robots play an increasingly important role in the military, fisheries, aquaculture, resource protection, etc. The main way for underwater robots to obtain information is underwater target detection, and the development of underwater robots is inseparable from the development of underwater target detection technology. Existing target detection algorithms have achieved good results on land, but are often unsatisfactory in actual underwater target detection. In this paper, based on the principle of plant intelligence and the target detection algorithm YOLOv5, our proposes the PILLO algorithm to adapt to the underwater environment with blurred imaging and insufficient light, and is specially used for underwater target detection. Specifically, the Swin Transformer is improved based on the principles of the multicore plant intelligence model, which then replaces part of the backbone network of the PILLO algorithm. The Shuffle Attention mechanism is improved based on the principles of the plant logical space transfer mechanism and added to the neck network of the PILLO algorithm. The SIOU loss function was improved based on the principle of the plant ecological regulation module and applied to the PILLO algorithm. The experimental results show that the PILLO model can improve the average accuracy (mAP) of underwater target detection by 87.1%, which is better than the common target detection model.

AB Background. Figures and captions in medical documentation contain important information. As a result, researchers are becoming more interested in obtaining published medical figures from medical papers and utilizing the captions as a knowledge source.Methods. This work introduces a unique and successful six-fold methodology for extracting figure-caption pairs. The A-torus wavelet transform is used to retrieve the first edge from the scanned page. Then, using the maximally stable extremal regions connected component feature, text and graphical contents are isolated from the edge document, and multi-layer perceptron is used to successfully detect and retrieve figures and captions from medical records. The figure-caption pair is then extracted using the bounding box approach. The files that contain the figures and captions are saved separately and supplied to the end useras theoutput of any investigation. The proposed approach is evaluated using a self-created database based on the pages collected from five open access books: Sergey Makarov, Gregory Noetscher and Aapo Nummenmaa's book "Brain and Human Body Modelling 2021", "Healthcare and Disease Burden in Africa"by Ilha Niohuru, "All-Optical Methods to Study Neuronal Function"by Eirini Papagiakoumou, "RNA, the Epicenter of Genetic Information"by John Mattick and Paulo Amaral and "Illustrated Manual of Pediatric Dermatology"by Susan Bayliss Mallory, Alanna Bree and Peggy Chern.Results. Experiments and findings comparing the new method to earlier systems reveal a significant increase in efficiency, demonstrating the suggested technique's robustness and efficiency.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In modern education, mental health problems have become the focus and difficulty of students' education. Painting therapy has been integrated into the school's art education as an effective mental health intervention. Deep learning can automatically learn the image features and abstract the low-level image features into high-level features. However, traditional image classification models are prone to lose background information, resulting in poor adaptability of the classification model. Therefore, this article extracts the lost colour of painting images based on K-means clustering and proposes a painting style classification model based on an improved convolutional neural network (CNN), where a modified Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is proposed to amplify the data. Then, the CNN network structure is optimized by adjusting the network's vertical depth and horizontal width. Finally, a new activation function, PPReLU, is proposed to suppress the excessive value of the positive part. The experimental results show that the proposed model has the highest accuracy in classifying painting image styles by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods, whose accuracy is up to 91.55%, which is 8.7% higher than that of traditional CNN.

DE Chinese; BERT; Syntax; Fine-tune; NLP
AB Pre-trained language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been applied to a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks and obtained significantly positive results. A growing body of research has investigated the reason why BERT is so efficient and what language knowledge BERT is able to learn. However, most of these works focused almost exclusively on English. Few studies have explored the language information, particularly syntactic information, that BERT has learned in Chinese, which is written as sequences of characters. In this study, we adopted some probing methods for identifying syntactic knowledge stored in the attention heads and hidden states of Chinese BERT. The results suggest that some individual heads and combination of heads do well in encoding corresponding and overall syntactic relations, respectively. The hidden representation of each layer also contained syntactic information to different degrees. We also analyzed the fine-tuned models of Chinese BERT for different tasks, covering all levels. Our results suggest that these fine-turned models reflect changes in conserving language structure. These findings help explain why Chinese BERT can show such large improvements across many language-processing tasks.

TI Structure-Aware DropEdge Toward Deep Graph Convolutional Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE DropEdge plus plus; feature-dependent (FD) sampler; graph convolutional
   network (GCN); layer-dependent (LD) sam-pler; mean-edge-number (MEN)
AB It has been discovered that graph convolutional networks (GCNs) encounter a remarkable drop in performance when multiple layers are piled up. The main factor that accounts for why deep GCNs fail lies in oversmoothing, which isolates the network output from the input with the increase of network depth, weakening expressivity and trainability. In this article, we start by investigating refined measures upon DropEdge-an existing simple yet effective technique to relieve oversmoothing. We term our method as DropEdge $++$ for its two structure-aware samplers in contrast to DropEdge: layer-dependent (LD) sampler and feature-dependent (FD) sampler. Regarding the LD sampler, we interestingly find that increasingly sampling edges from the bottom layer yields superior performance than the decreasing counterpart as well as DropEdge. We theoretically reveal this phenomenon with mean-edge-number (MEN), a metric closely related to oversmoothing. For the FD sampler, we associate the edge sampling probability with the feature similarity of node pairs and prove that it further correlates the convergence subspace of the output layer with the input features. Extensive experiments on several node classification benchmarks, including both full-and semi-supervised tasks, illustrate the efficacy of DropEdge $++$ and its compatibility with a variety of backbones by achieving generally better performance over DropEdge and the no-drop version.

AB Gesture recognition has drawn considerable attention from many researchers owing to its wide range of applications. Although significant progress has been made in this field, previous works always focus on how to distinguish between different gesture classes, ignoring the influence of inner-class divergence caused by gesture-irrelevant factors. Meanwhile, for multimodal gesture recognition, feature or score fusion in the final stage is a general choice to combine the information of different modalities. Consequently, the gesture-relevant features in different modalities may be redundant, whereas the complementarity of modalities is not exploited sufficiently. To handle these problems, we propose a hierarchical gesture prototype framework to highlight gesture-relevant features such as poses and motions in this article. This framework consists of a sample-level prototype and a modal-level prototype. The sample-level gesture prototype is established with the structure of a memory bank, which avoids the distraction of gesture-irrelevant factors in each sample, such as the illumination, background, and the performers' appearances. Then the modal-level prototype is obtained via a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based subnetwork, in which the modal-invariant features are extracted and pulled together. Meanwhile, the modal-specific attribute features are used to synthesize the feature of other modalities, and the circulation of modality information helps to leverage their complementarity. Extensive experiments on three widely used gesture datasets demonstrate that our method is effective to highlight gesture-relevant features and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Temporal graph neural network (GNN) has recently received significant attention due to its wide application scenarios, such as bioinformatics, knowledge graphs, and social networks. There are some temporal GNNs that achieve remarkable results. However, these works focus on future event prediction and are performed under the assumption that all historical events are observable. In real-world applications, events are not always observable, and estimating event time is as important as predict-ing future events. In this article, we propose MTGN, a missing event-aware temporal GNN, which uniformly models evolving graph structure and timing of events to support predicting what will happen in the future and when it will happen. MTGN mod-els the dynamic of both observed and missing events as two coupled temporal point processes (TPPs), thereby incorporating the effects of missing events into the network. Experimental results on several real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that MTGN significantly outperforms the existing methods with up to 89% and 112% more accurate time and link prediction. Code can be found on https://github.com/HIT-ICES/TNNLS-MTGN.

AB The design of real-time safety assessment (RTSA) approaches in nonstationary environments is meaningful to reduce the possibility of significant losses. However, several challenging problems are needed to be well considered. The performance of existing approaches will be negatively affected in the settings of imbalanced drifting streams. In this case, the model design with the incremental update should also be explored. Furthermore, the query strategy should also be well-designed. This article investigates a dynamic submodular-based learning strategy to address such issues. Specifically, an efficient incremental update procedure is designed with the structure of the broad learning system (BLS), which is beneficial to the detection of concept drift. Furthermore, a novel dynamic submodular-based annotation with an activation interval strategy is proposed to select valuable samples in imbalanced drifting streams. The lower bound of annotation value is also proven theoretically with a novel drift adaption mechanism. Numerous experiments are conducted with the realistic data of JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve better assessment accuracy than typical existing approaches.

AB This article investigates the adaptive optimal tracking problem for a class of nonlinear affine systems with asymmetric Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis nonlinearities based on actor-critic (A-C) learning mechanisms. Considering the huge obstacles arising from the uncertainty of hysteresis nonlinearity in actuators, we develop a scheme for the conflict between the construction of Hamilton functions and hysteresis nonlinearity. The actuator hysteresis forces the input into a hysteresis delay, thus preventing the Hamilton function from getting the current moment's input instantly and thus making optimization impossible. In the first step, an inverse model is constructed to compensate for the hysteresis model with a shift factor. In the second step, we compensate for the control input by designing a feedback controller and incorporating the estimation and approximation errors into the Hamilton error. Optimal control, the other part of the actual control input, is obtained by taking partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian function after the nonlinearities have been circumvented. At the end, a simulation is given to validate the developed solution.

AB The pedestrian trajectory prediction task is an essential component of intelligent systems. Its applications include but are not limited to autonomous driving, robot navigation, and anomaly detection of monitoring systems. Due to the diversity of motion behaviors and the complex social interactions among pedestrians, accurately forecasting their future trajectory is challenging. Existing approaches commonly adopt generative adversarial networks (GANs) or conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate diverse trajectories. However, GAN-based methods do not directly model data in a latent space, which may make them fail to have full support over the underlying data distribution. CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood of observations, which may cause the learned distribution to deviate from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing approaches often generate highly biased or inaccurate trajectories. In this article, we propose a novel generative flow-based framework with a dual-graphormer for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow). Different from previous approaches, our method can more precisely model the underlying data distribution by optimizing the exact log-likelihood of motion behaviors. Besides, our method has clear physical meanings for simulating the evolution of human motion behaviors. The forward process of the flow gradually degrades complex motion behavior into simple behavior, while its reverse process represents the evolution of simple behavior into complex motion behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-graphormer combined with the graph structure to more adequately model the temporal dependencies and the mutual spatial interactions. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves much better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Aiming at the nonlinear and non-stationarity of gearbox fault signals and the confusion among different fault categories, a gear fault diagnosis method combining variational mode decomposition, reconstruction and ResNeXt is proposed in this paper. In this paper, parameter K of VMD is determined according to the changing trend of sample entropy (SE), K modal components are obtained after decomposition, and the effective modal components are extracted and reconstructed according to Pearson autocorrelation coefficient, so as to remove redundant information from the original signal. Then the reconstructed signal is transformed by time-frequency and output two-dimensional time-frequency information, which is used as the input of ResNeXt model to extract the characteristics of different faults. Moreover, the model performance is improved by changing the learning rate decline rate, and a fault diagnosis model with high precision and good stability is established.

AB We present a comprehensive study on Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities for interval-valued functions that are h-preinvex, using the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. Our research extends and generalizes some existing results found in the literature. In addition, we provide accurate proofs for the main theorems originally derived by Srivastava et al. in their publication titled ''Hermite-Hadamard Type Inequalities for Interval-Valued Preinvex Functions via Fractional Integral Operators'' (Int. J. Comput. Int. Sys. 15(1):8, 2022). Finally, we illustrate our findings through a practical example to demonstrate the validity of our results.

ID ATTENTION
AB Bokeh effect is usually used to highlight major contents in an image. Limited by the small sensors, cameras on smartphones are less sensitive to the depth information and cannot directly produce bokeh effect as pleasant as digital single lens reflex cameras. To address this problem, a depth-guided deep filtering network, called DDFN, is proposed in this study. Specifically, the focused region detection block is designed to detect the salient areas, and the depth estimated block is introduced to estimate depth maps from full-focus images. Further, combining depth maps and focused features, an adaptive rendering block is proposed to synthesize bokeh effect with adaptive cross 1-D filters. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-theart methods in terms of rendering effects and has lower computational cost, e.g., 24.07 dB PSNR on EBB! dataset and 0.45 s inference times for a 512 x 768 image on a Snapdragon 865 mobile processor.

ID GESTURE RECOGNITION
AB A sign language recognition system can be applied to reduce a communication gap between deaf and normal persons. However, the Indian sign language recognition (ISL) systems are in the developing stage. Most of the recent ISL recognition systems use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) where applied convolution operation shifts a kernel to overlapping portions over the image. However, these kernels may learn redundant data since real-world images have very high correlations. The training process of neural networks is challenging for redundant image data. To overcome this limitation, an ISL recognition system has been proposed in this paper that uses the network deconvolution technique. This technique reduces not only pixel-wise correlation but also a channel-wise correlation in images. The proposed model is also augmented with a spatial transformer network to increase spatial invariance of convolution operations against spatial transformations. The proposed recognizer offers better accuracy most of the time than other experimented systems on two ISL datasets VUCS_ISL_I and created VUCS_ISL_II and standard datasets of other sign languages, i.e., American sign language, Arabic sign language, Spanish sign language.

AB In this paper, a novel distributed adaptive neurodynamic approach (DANA) based on proportional integral technique is proposed to solve distributed optimization problem on multi-agent systems. The goal is that all agents reach consensus in finite time and converge to the optimal solution of the global objective function in fixed time. In the proposed approach, the proportional technique drives all agents to reach consensus, and the integral technique is used to offset the influence of the gradient term of the objective function. On the other hand, in order to avoid the prior estimation of gain parameter and the global gradient information, as the main contribution of this paper, the adaptive idea is considered into proportional integral technique. The results show that the adaptive integral technique can automatically adjust the gain according to the maximum consensus error between agents, so as to ensure that agents can achieve consensus in finite time. Then the theoretical results are applied to voltage distribution and logistic regression. Numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness of DANA.

   disentanglement
AB Currently end-to-end deep learning based open-domain dialogue systems remain black box models, making it easy to generate irrelevant contents with data-driven models. Specifically, latent variables are highly entangled with different semantics in the latent space due to the lack of priori knowledge to guide the training. To address this problem, this paper proposes to harness the generative model with a priori knowledge through a cognitive approach involving feature disentanglement. Particularly, the model integrates the guided-category knowledge and open-domain dialogue data for the training, leveraging the priori knowledge into the latent space, which enables the model to disentangle the latent variables. Besides, this paper proposes a new metric for open-domain dialogues, which can objectively evaluate the interpretability of the latent space distribution. Finally, this paper validates our model on different datasets and experimentally demonstrate that our model is able to generate higher quality and more interpretable dialogues than other models.

In the considered problem, an extended stage cost function depending on the control inputs is introduced; in contrast to a stage cost of the conventional KL control problems in the Markov decision process cannot take into consideration the control inputs. An associated Bellman equation and a matrix-based iteration algorithm are presented. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed KL control results in an approximated form of conventional dynamic programming (DP). Furthermore, the convergence analysis is presented, with the weight parameter converging to zero and diverging to infinity. In practical application examples, a comparison of the conventional DP and proposed KL control is illustrated.

AB Medical images from different modalities, contrast sequences, and settings can provide diverse information in clinical applications and medical analysis. However, some modalities or contrast sequences may be missing or degraded due to strict timing and artifacts during acquisition, leaving many unpaired data. Therefore, it is meaningful to synthesize realistic medical images with unpaired data. This article proposed a general multi-task method for end-to-end cross-domain synthesis and segmentation network, named SSA-Net, based on cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN), using unpaired data for training. A gradient-consistency loss is introduced to supervise the synthesis around the contour, refining the boundaries in synthesized images. And a special shape-consistency term is designed to constrain the anatomical structure in synthesized images, guiding segmentation without target labels. Besides, we introduce the attention mechanism into the generators to focus on some hard-to-learn regions in the images. The FC-DenseNet is employed as a segmentation network to enhance segmentation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SSA-Net can achieve an S-score of 0.895 on CT images of the CHAOS dataset and a DSC of 0.838 for segmenting the liver, which is a significant increase compared to baseline CycleGAN. Experiment results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain synthesis and segmentation framework.

LRGN is composed of a sequential-variational generative adversarial network (SVGAN), a coupled SVGAN (Co-SVGAN), and a knowledge-aggregated SVGAN. First, the Co-SVGAN can learn domain-invariant latent representations to model dual-domain joint distribution of background data, which is usually sufficient in the source and target scenarios. Deceptive domain shifts are generated based on the domain-invariant latent representations without auxiliary information. Then, SVGAN models the changing knowledge by estimating the distribution of domain shifts. Furthermore, the knowledge-aggregated SVGAN can transfer the learned domain-invariant knowledge from Co-SVGAN for generalizing the latent representations through approximating the distribution of domain shifts. Accordingly, LRGN is trained by a four-phase optimization strategy for DG through generating target-scenario samples of concerned events based on the generalized latent representations. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through real-field experiments of perimeter security applications in two scenarios.

ID MARKETPLACE
AB This study focuses on the optimal pricing and product refurbishing decisions of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a retailer in a supply chain. The OEM sells the new product through a retailer, which serves as a reseller or selling agency, and then chooses whether to provide the refurbished product to consumers. By constructing four models, we obtain the following results. First, we show that the OEM and the retailer always prefer to sell a refurbished product as a monopoly. Second, competing refurbishments leads to a prisoner's dilemma in which both parties suffer greater losses compared to the no refurbishment scenario. This implies that competing refurbishments, except for product cannibalization, hinder the refurbishing industry. Finally, with different refurbishers, the OEM has different preferences for a new product's selling format. However, when the retailer serves as the sole refurbisher, the OEM always prefers agency mode.

AB This work aims at designing a novel evolving fuzzy prediction interval able to model nonlinear time-variant systems. To achieve this goal, we integrate a passive mechanism meant to update the model when new data are available with an active mechanism able to trigger ad-hoc adaptation mechanisms when changes are detected in the data-generating process. The base model considered for this proposal was the prediction interval based on fuzzy numbers, which allow handling the characterization of the uncertainty of a system through additional parameters focused on the computation of the interval width. The performance of the proposed solution has been tested on both synthetic and real data. In this work, the synthetic data was generated from a generic nonlinear time-variant system, while the real data correspond to measurements of solar power generation obtained from photovoltaic panels. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed evolving fuzzy prediction interval for modeling systems that present changes in their dynamics over time.

AB The fractional-order (FO) nonlinear differential system with state-dependent (SD) delayed impulses (DI) is considered in this brief. The considered impulses are related to the delayed state of the system and the delays are SD. A novel lemma for the monotonicity of the solution of Caputo's FO derivative equation is given. By means of linear matrix inequality (LMI) and several comparative arguments, criteria of uniform stability, uniform asymptotical stability, and Mittag-Leffler stability are obtained. Compared with other works on integer-order (IO) impulsive delayed systems with SD delays or fixed delays, how to impose constraints on parameters and impulses is explored, without imposing the boundedness on the state delays. Two examples are implemented to examine the practicality and sharpness of our theoretical analysis.

AB As the profit and safety requirements become higher and higher, it is more and more necessary to realize an advanced intelligent analysis for abnormity forecast of the synthetical balance of material and energy (AF-SBME) on aluminum reduction cells (ARCs). Without loss of generality, AF-SBME belongs to classification problems. Its advanced intelligent analysis can be realized by high-performance data-driven classifiers. However, AF-SBME has some difficulties, including a high requirement for interpretability of data-driven classifiers, a small number, and decreasing-over-time correctness of training samples. In this article, based on a preferable data-driven classifier, which is called a reinforced $k$ -nearest neighbor (R-KNN) classifier, a delicately R-KNN combined with expert knowledge (DR-KNN/CE) is proposed. It improves R-KNN in two ways, including using expert knowledge as external assistance and enhancing self-ability to mine and synthesize data knowledge. The related experiments on AF-SBME, where the relevant data are directly sampled from practical production, have demonstrated that the proposed DR-KNN/CE not only makes an effective improvement for R-KNN, but also has a more advanced performance compared with other existing high-performance data-driven classifiers.

AB Neural network models generally involve two important components, i.e., network architecture and neuron model. Although there are abundant studies about network architectures, only a few neuron models have been developed, such as the MP neuron model developed in 1943 and the spiking neuron model developed in the 1950s. Recently, a new bio-plausible neuron model, Flexible Transmitter (FT) model, has been proposed. It exhibits promising behaviors, particularly on temporal-spatial signals, even when simply embedded into the common feedforward network architecture. This paper attempts to understand the properties of the FT network (FTNet) theoretically. Under mild assumptions, we show that: i) FTNet is a universal approximator; ii) the approximation complexity of FTNet can be exponentially smaller than those of commonly-used real-valued neural networks with feedforward/recurrent architectures and is of the same order in the worst case; iii) any local minimum of FTNet is the global minimum, implying that it is possible to identify global minima by local search algorithms.

AB Forming deep feature embeddings is an effective method for few-shot learning (FSL). However, in the case of insufficient samples, overcoming the task complexity while improving the accuracy is still a major challenge. To address this problem, this article considers the consistency between similar data from the fractal perspective, introduces a priori knowledge, and proposes a fractal embedding model by combining FSL with fractal dimension theory for the first time. We improve the original fractal dimension algorithm used to describe image texture roughness to suit a neural network. Moreover, in accordance with the improved algorithm, prior knowledge of the quantized image is integrated into the features to reduce the impact of the data distribution on the model. Experimental results obtained on multiple image benchmark datasets show that the performance of the proposed model exceeds or matches that of previous state-of-the-art models. In addition, the proposed model achieves the best performance in cross-domain scenarios, further illustrating its robustness.

TI ATGAN: Adversarial training-based GAN for improving adversarial
   robustness generalization on image classification
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Image classification; Adversarial robustness; Generative adversarial
   networks; Adversarial training
AB Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are well-designed examples aiming to cause models to produce wrong outputs with high confidence. Although adversarial training is by so far the only effective adversarial defense method, adversarially trained models still suffer from the poor robustness generalization problem when the magnitude of perturbations is higher than the value used during training. In order to boost adversarial training against stronger perturbations, an Adversarially Trained GAN (ATGAN) is proposed in this paper. The advantages of the ATGAN are two folds: 1) the ATGAN adopts an image-to-image generator to map adversarial examples back onto the manifold of clean examples in order to reduce the power of adversarial examples. This transformation also has the effect of data augmentation, which increases the sample complexity of adversarial examples; 2) the ATGAN incorporates adversarial training into the standard GAN training procedure to remove obfuscated gradients which can lead to a false sense in defending against adversarial perturbations and are commonly observed in existing GANs-based adversarial defense methods. Extensive experiments are conducted in both white-box and black-box attacks scenarios on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method does not rely on obfuscated gradients and achieves better adversarial robustness generalization performance under strong adversarial perturbations compared to the state-of-the-art adversarial training-based defense methods.

AB Metric learning has emerged as a critical tool for analyzing the semantic similarities between objects. However, numerous existing methods are incapable of simultaneously maximizing the proximity of similar pairs and the separability between dissimilar ones to achieve the largest margin principle. Additionally, most graph Laplacian-based semi-supervised approaches fail to consider the valuable dissimilar information of unlabeled data, and they treat neighborhood graph construction and metric learning as separate procedures, thereby breaking the unified relationship between these two components. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable and efficient metric learning framework called Unified metric learNing based on maxIum enTropy (UNIT). UNIT attempts to unify supervised and semi-supervised metric learning into a framework by introducing the maximum entropy regularizer of the eigenvalues of the learned matrix. With the novel regularizer, UNIT can maximize the closeness of similar instances and the separability of dissimilar ones without encountering the trivial solution problem. Furthermore, the adaptive graph Laplacian, formulated by a similar graph as well as a dissimilar graph, is constructed to mine the rich discriminant information of the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that UNIT can be solved efficiently with the alternating direction method, with each sub-problem being solvable using a closed-form solution. To account for nonlinear data distribution, a kernelized version of UNIT is also provided. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through extensive supervised and semi-supervised experiments on various datasets.

DE Generative models; Assessment; Time series
AB Despite recent breakthroughs in the domain of implicit generative models, the task of evaluating these models remains a challenging task. With no single metric to assess overall performance, various existing metrics only offer partial information. This issue is further compounded for unintuitive data types such as time series, where manual inspection is infeasible. This deficiency hinders the confident application of modern implicit generative models on time series data. To alleviate this problem, we propose two new metrics, the InceptionTime Score (ITS) and the Frechet InceptionTime Distance (FITD), to assess the quality of class-conditional generative models on time series data. We conduct extensive experiments on 80 different datasets to study the discriminative capabilities of proposed metrics alongside two existing evaluation metrics: Train on Synthetic Test on Real (TSTR) and Train on Real Test on Synthetic (TRTS). Our evaluations reveal that the proposed assessment evaluation metrics, i.e., ITS and FITD in combination with TSTR, can accurately assess class-conditional generative model performance and detect common issues in implicit generative models. Our findings suggest that the proposed evaluation framework can be a valuable tool for confidently applying modern implicit generative models in time series analysis.

   Multi-scale rotated features; Embedding optimize loss
AB Fisheye cameras has a large field of view, so it is widely used in scene monitoring, robot navigation, intelligent system, virtual reality panorama, augmented reality panorama and other fields, but person detection under the overhead fisheye camera is still a challenge due to its unique radial geometry and barrel distortion. Generic object detection algorithms do not work well for person detection on panoramic images of the fisheye camera. Recent approaches either use radially aligned bounding boxes to detect persons or improve anchor-based methods to obtain rotated bounding boxes. However, these methods require additional hyperparameters (e.g., anchor boxes) and have low generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose a novel model called Group Equivariant Transformer (GET) which uses the Transformer to directly regress the bounding boxes and rotation angles. GET not need any additional hyperparameters and have generalization ability. In our GET, we uses the Group Equivariant Convolutional Network (GECN) and Multi-Scale Encoder Module (MEM) to extract multi-scale rotated embedding features of overhead fisheye image for Transformer, then we propose an embedding optimization loss to improve the diversity of these features. Finally, we use a Decoder Module (DM) to decode the rotated bounding boxes'information from embedding features. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark fisheye camera datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state of the art.

   neural architecture search; Encoder-decoder
AB Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is critical in enabling intelligent autonomous systems and has received considerable attention in recent years. Achieving both low latency and high accuracy in MDE is desirable but challenging to optimize, especially on edge devices. In this paper, we present a novel approach to balancing speed and accuracy in MDE on edge devices. We introduce FasterMDE, an efficient and fast encoder-decoder network architecture that leverages a multiobjective neural architecture search method to find the optimal encoder structure for the target edge. Moreover, we incorporate a neural window fully connected CRF module into the network as the decoder, enhancing fine-grained depth prediction based on coarse depth and image features. To address the issue of bad "local minimums" in the multiobjective neural architecture search, we propose a new approach for automatically learning the weights of subobjective loss functions based on uncertainty. We also accelerate the FasterMDE model using TensorRT and implement it on a target edge device. The experimental results demonstrate that FasterMDE achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets compared to previous methods. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through an ablation study and verify the real-time monocular depth estimation performance of FasterMDE in realistic scenarios. On the KITTI dataset, the FasterMDE model achieves a high frame rate of 555.55 FPS with 9.1% Abs Rel on a single NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU and 14.46 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

ID RELIABILITY
AB In the cervical region of middle-aged and elderly patients, cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is frequently recognized as the primary factor that contributes to spinal cord dysfunction. Numbness and gait disturbance are the main clinical manifestations of CSM, which exhibits as a stiff and spastic gait in comparison with that of healthy controls (HCs). Because it is difficult to screen CSM in the primary stage which easily leading to a delay in medication, the identification of CSM followed by treatment is urgent. The aim of this study is to develop an automated classification method for the screening of CSM, using fifty-four lower extremity kinematic parameters derived from three-dimensional gait analysis. The present study employs a deep neural network (DNN) model to automatically extract informative features from raw gait kinematic data. Hierarchically placed layers in the DNN produce deep feature maps that are used to screen CSM using multiple shallow classifiers. The proposed method is evaluated using a self-constructed gait database of patients diagnosed with CSM and HCs, both groups consisting of 45 individuals within a similar age range. Experimental results reveal that the combination of deep features and shallow classifiers yields remarkable accuracy rates for binary classification with twofold, tenfold, and leave-one-out cross-validation methods, all achieving an accuracy of 99.44 %. The data suggest that our approach is efficient in detecting the early onset CSM and performs better than other cutting-edge techniques.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown good performance in many practical applications. However, their high computational and storage requirements make them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel iterative structured pruning algorithm for CNNs based on the recursive least squares (RLS) optimization. Our algorithm combines inverse input autocorrelation matrices with weight matrices to evaluate and prune unimportant input channels or nodes in each CNN layer and performs the next pruning operation when the testing loss is tuned down to the last unpruned level. Our algorithm can be used to prune feedforward neural networks (FNNs) as well. The fast convergence speed of the RLS optimization allows our algorithm to prune CNNs and FNNs multiple times in a small number of epochs. We validate its effectiveness in pruning VGG-16 and ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and pruning a three-layer FNN on MNIST. Compared with four popular pruning algorithms, our algorithm can adaptively prune CNNs according to the learning task difficulty and can effectively prune CNNs and FNNs with a small or even no reduction in accuracy. In addition, our algorithm can prune the original sample features in the input layer.

AB The differential evolution algorithm based on multi-population mainly improves its performance through mutation strategy and grouping mechanism. However, each sub-population plays a different role in different periods of iterative evolution. If each sub-population is assigned the same computing resources, it will waste a lot of computing resources. In order to rationally distribute computational resources, an integrated differential evolution of multi-population based on contribution degree (MDE-ctd) is put forth in this work. In MDE-ctd, the whole population is divided into three sub-populations according to different update strategies: archival, exploratory, and integrated sub-populations. MDE-ctd dynamically adjusts computing resources according to the contribution degree of each sub-population. It can effectively use computing resources and speed up convergence. In the updating process of integrated sub-populations, a mutation strategy pool and two-parameter value pools are used to maintain population diversity. The experimental results of CEC2005 and CEC2014 benchmark functions show that MDE-ctd outperforms other state-of-art differential evolution algorithms based on multi-population, especially when it deals with highly complex optimization problems.

AB What are the relations between the edge weights and the topology in real-world graphs? Given only the topology of a graph, how can we assign realistic weights to its edges based on the relations? Several trials have been done for edge-weight prediction where some unknown edge weights are predicted with most edge weights known. There are also existing works on generating both topology and edge weights of weighted graphs. Differently, we are interested in generating edge weights that are realistic in a macroscopic scope, merely from the topology, which is unexplored and challenging. To this end, we explore and exploit the patterns involving edge weights and topology in real-world graphs. Specifically, we divide each graph into layers where each layer consists of the edges with weights at least a threshold. We observe consistent and surprising patterns appearing in multiple layers: the similarity between being adjacent and having high weights, and the nearly-linear growth of the fraction of edges having high weights with the number of common neighbors. We also observe a power-law pattern that connects the layers. Based on the observations, we propose PEAR, an algorithm assigning realistic edge weights to a given topology. The algorithm relies on only two parameters, preserves all the observed patterns, and produces more realistic weights than the baseline methods with more parameters.

TI Fast block-wise partitioning for extreme multi-label classification

AB Extreme multi-label classification aims to learn a classifier that annotates an instance with a relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Many existing solutions embed the label matrix to a low-dimensional linear subspace, or examine the relevance of a test instance to every label via a linear scan. In practice, however, those approaches can be computationally exorbitant. To alleviate this drawback, we propose a Block-wise Partitioning (BP) pretreatment that divides all instances into disjoint clusters, to each of which the most frequently tagged label subset is attached. One multi-label classifier is trained on one pair of instance and label clusters, and the label set of a test instance is predicted by first delivering it to the most appropriate instance cluster. Experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets reveal that BP pretreatment significantly reduces prediction time, and retains almost the same level of prediction accuracy.

AB Relations among multiple entities are prevalent in many fields, and hypergraphs are widely used to represent such group relations. Hence, machine learning on hypergraphs has received considerable attention, and especially much effort has been made in neural network architectures for hypergraphs (a.k.a., hypergraph neural networks). However, existing studies mostly focused on small datasets for a few single-entity-level downstream tasks and overlooked scalability issues, although most real-world group relations are large-scale. In this work, we propose new tasks, datasets, and scalable training methods for addressing these limitations. First, we introduce two pair-level hypergraph-learning tasks to formulate a wide range of real-world problems. Then, we build and publicly release two large-scale hypergraph datasets with tens of millions of nodes, rich features, and labels. After that, we propose PCL, a scalable learning method for hypergraph neural networks. To tackle scalability issues, PCL splits a given hypergraph into partitions and trains a neural network via contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that hypergraph neural networks can be trained for large-scale hypergraphs by PCL while outperforming 16 baseline models. Specifically, the performance is comparable, or surprisingly even better than that achieved by training hypergraph neural networks on the entire hypergraphs without partitioning.

AB Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or the Time of Failure (ToF) is the main concern of predictive maintenance. Accurately predicting the RUL for systems with small datasets is challenging. To solve the problem of low RUL prediction accuracy in such cases, a novel approach based on machine learning is proposed to accurately predict the RUL of systems with limited data. The proposed system implements a self-adaptive Neural Network (NN), where a feedback mechanism is added to the NN architecture to improve the model training with updated features. The prognosis system is validated using real data collected from oil and gas wells during production to predict the ToF of a Subsurface Safety Valve system. To simulate the tool being in service, only fractions of data are given to the prediction model, the predictions are fitted using a curve-fitting function to estimate the intersection between the estimation and the x-axis (ToF). Experimental results showed the positive effect of the proposed approach in improving prediction accuracy for systems with insufficient data; experimental evaluation has been conducted in terms of Mean Square Error and RUL absolute estimation error showing an improvement compared to the baseline approach.

ID QUANTITATIVE MODEL; PREDICTION; PLANT; IDENTIFICATION
AB The study and development of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems are relevant tasks for industrial processes. Another prominent field is applying deep learning (DL) models to solve engineering problems, such as FDD systems' design. Often, the preliminary tests are conducted using simulated datasets to verify the chosen methodology and avoid unnecessarily disturbing the real process. Even if the data used come from a computer simulation, it must remain as realistic as possible. In several studies, researchers have used the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark for addressing the application of DL models to build effective FDD frameworks. However, most of them use preexisting datasets, and this presents some drawbacks that can negatively impact the DL model's training stage. In addition, none of them have evaluated how to adjust the existing FDD model when the process control strategy is changed. This paper presents various topologies of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model a FDD system for the TEP benchmark using new datasets. For the first time, we investigate the performance of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) in the TEP study case. Additionally, we apply transfer learning (TL) to surpass the model inadequacy when the data distribution changes due to an alteration in the process' closed-loop system.

AB The Induction Motor (IM) is one of the most frequently used prime movers in most industrial and transportation systems. The motor's stable and safe operation directly influences the secure and reliable operation of such prime movers. Developing an intelligent fault diagnosis system for such motors is very significant. This paper presents an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on the improved functionality of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) through its hyperparameter optimization using a nature-inspired Artificial Bee Colony Optimization (ABCO) algorithm. The proposed diagnostic method introduces and analyses various possible mechanical and electrical faults in the IM. The validation of the proposed method is presented with three different modalities, including vibration, acoustic, and infrared thermography, with their comparative performance analysis. Vibration and acoustic-based detection are done with time-frequency scalograms using Constant Q Transform (CQT), which provides enhanced time resolution for lower and higher frequencies. The obtained result indicates that the infrared thermography-based anomaly detection outperforms the vibration and acoustic-based diagnosis with 100% classification accuracy. The results signify the potential to diagnose different mechanical and electrical faults in IM with substantial reliability and robustness.

AB The exponential growth in the use of smartphones means that users must constantly be concerned about the security and privacy of mobile data because the loss of a mobile device could compromise personal information. To address this issue, continuous authentication systems have been proposed, in which users are monitored transparently after initial access to the smartphone. In this study, the authors address the problem of user authentication by considering human activities as behavioural biometric information. The authors convert the behavioural biometric data (considered as time series) into a 2D colour image. This transformation process keeps all the characteristics of the behavioural signal. Time series does not receive any filtering operation with this transformation, and the method is reversible. This signal-to-image transformation allows us to use the 2D convolutional networks to build efficient deep feature vectors. This allows them to compare these feature vectors to the reference template vectors to compute the performance metric. The authors evaluate the performance of the authentication system in terms of Equal Error Rate on a benchmark University of Californy, Irvine Human Activity Recognition dataset, and they show the efficiency of the approach.

AB To segment noisy and multi-target images, an active contour model based on a hybrid signed pressure force function that fuses global and local information of the image is proposed. Firstly, a local signed pressure force function is defined using the local area information of the image. Then, it is combined with the existing global grey density function to construct a new signed pressure force function. Finally, the selective binary and Gaussian filtering regularized level set are modified using the newly defined function. Extensive experiments and comparisons on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to noise and can handle noisy and multi-target images with high accuracy.

AB Facial expression recognition technology has become a powerful tool for conveying human emotions and intentions and is widely used in areas such as assisted driving and intelligent medical care. Due to the limited computing power of current hardware devices and the real-time requirements of application scenarios, this paper proposes a high-performance and lightweight framework for real-time facial expression recognition framework to solve the problem of real-time completion of expression recognition tasks under low hardware costs. To address these issues, this paper first designs a RepVGG and mobileNetV2 dual-channel structure in the feature extraction. It is then input into the MobileViT Block for global feature modelling. Finally, the position vector of the capsule network is used to replace the output of the global pooling, preserving the spatial relationship of the salient features and enhancing the classification effect. Compared with the mainstream facial expression recognition algorithm that cannot get good classification results under low complexity conditions, the model has a significant accuracy improvement while ensuring lightweight. With only 294.60M FLOPS and 0.95M parameters, it achieved an accuracy of 97.53% on the KDEF dataset and 85.56% on the RAF-DB, demonstrating the advanced nature of the algorithm.

AB The effect of snowfall on an image is not only the interference of snow particles but also snow streaks and masking effects (similar to haze). Snowy weather severely reduces the accuracy of computer vision systems. There is a lot of interest in how to effectively remove snow while preserving as much of the original image information as possible. Based on this, the authors propose an effective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) snow removal algorithm for single images to solve the snow removal failure problem caused by irregular snow particles and snow streaks. Specifically, the authors improve the original GAN network as follows: A novel Transformer module, the Contextual Transformer (CoT) module, is adopted in the residual modules based generator. It effectively uses the contextual information of the snow streaks neighbourhood to restore the texture and information in the noisy image as much as possible based on the focus on snow streaks features. Also, using learnable Regionalized Normalization (RN-L), potentially corrupted and undamaged regions are automatically detected for separate normalization, and global affine transformations are performed to enhance their fusion. In addition, a multi-scale discriminator is used in the discriminator to make the discrimination more adequate and retain more details. Extensive experiments have shown that the authors' GAN network snow removal algorithm outperforms various current networks on snow removal studies in terms of evaluation metrics on both synthetic and real datasets.

AB In an increasingly multilingual digital world, information management tools must support the simultaneous use and matching of multiple natural languages. A prerequisite for this is that the underlying database engine seamlessly processes multilingual data across languages. However, most natural language processing-based techniques have focused on developing monolingual matching algorithms, often ignoring context knowledge and external domain-based sources, which lead to incomplete and inaccurate matching results in a multilingual environment. The purpose of this study is to propose an adaptive semantic matching method with context knowledge and user involvement as two new dimensions for matching the semantically related entities ontologies. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our solution by applying it in a multilingual e-commerce platform case study, which performed well on matching accuracy.

AB Federated learning is an emerging collaborative learning paradigm of Machine learning involving distributed and heterogeneous clients. Enormous collections of continuously arriving heterogeneous data residing on distributed clients require federated adaptation of efficient mining algorithms to enable fair and high-quality predictions with privacy guarantees and minimal response delay. In this context, we propose a federated adaptation that mitigates discrimination embedded in the streaming data while handling concept drifts (FAC-Fed). We present a novel adaptive data augmentation method that mitigates client-side discrimination embedded in the data during optimization, resulting in an optimized and fair centralized server. Extensive experiments on a set of publicly available streaming and static datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt towards fairness-aware federated adaptation for stream classification, therefore, to prove the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art, we compare the centralized version of our proposed method with three centralized stream classification baseline models (FABBOO, FAHT, CSMOTE). The experimental results show that our method outperforms the current methods in terms of both discrimination mitigation and predictive performance.

DE Biomedical event causal relation extraction; External knowledge; Graph
   edge-cluster attention network; Cause-effect direction
AB Biomedical Event Causal Relation Extraction (BECRE) is a challenging task in biological information extraction and plays a crucial role to serve for knowledge base and knowledge graph construction. Here a biomedical cause-effect relation is defined as an association between two events and requires that the cause-event must occur before the effect-event. Some current advances tend to apply deep learning for the BECRE task and have achieved comparable performances. However, because most of event causal relations are implicitly stated, the performances of these works based on contextual semantics and syntactics might be limited. This fact suggests that it is necessary to introduce external cues to improve the performance of the implicit BECRE especially in the low source scenario. To improve the potential of the designed model, an intuitive idea is to introduce hierarchical knowledge from biological knowledge bases to supplement domain cues for the contexts. Nevertheless, it is difficult to learn the hierarchy and cause-effect direction of knowledge in the model and also few works focus on this issue. Thus, to better fuse knowledge, we propose a Graph Edge-Cluster Attention Network (GECANet) for the BECRE task. Specifically, we introduce external knowledge and build hierarchical knowledge graphs for the contexts. Also, the proposed GECANet effectively aggregates the context and hierarchical knowledge semantics under the guidance of cause-effect direction. The experimental results confirm that fusing external knowledge can effectively guide the model to identify event causal relations and facilitate our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performances respectively on the Hpowell and BioCause datasets.

AB There is a growing interest in the large area, lightweight, low-power electronic skin (e-Skin), consisting of a multitude of sensors over conformable surfaces. The use of multifunctional sensors is always challenging, especially when their energy requirements are considered. Herein, the heterogeneous integration of custom-made flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is demonstrated with a large area touch sensor array. The OPV can offer power density of more than 0.32 & mu;W cm(-2) at 1500 lux, which is sufficient to meet the instantaneous demand of the array of touch sensors. In addition to energy harvesting, it is shown that the OPVs can perform shadow sensing for proximity and gesture recognition, which are crucial features needed in the e-Skin, particularly for safe interaction in the industrial domain. Along with pressure sensing (sensitivity of up to 0.26 kPa(-1) in the range of 1-10 kPa) and spatial information, the touch sensors made of indium tin oxide and monolayer graphene have shown >70% transparency, which allow light to pass through them to reach the bottom OPV layer. With better resource management and space utilization, the presented stacked integration of transparent touch-sensing layer and OPVs can evolve into a futuristic energy-autonomous e-Skin that can "see" and "feel."

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting women worldwide. In this paper, we analyse physical and mental health factors affecting PCOS in women. We collected data in the form of questionnaires from women belonging to diverse backgrounds and performed a sensitivity analysis to find which factors are significant in determining the presence or absence of PCOS in women and further predict the severity of the symptoms. We implemented four types of methods for determining significant physical and mental health factors affecting the presence and degree of PCOS in women. Our analysis showed that menstrual period cycle length, menstrual period duration, regularity of menstrual periods, menstrual period flow, hair growth, eating pattern, and sleep pattern are the most significant physical health factors and feeling of worthlessness, depression, feeling of hopelessness, not able to be calm, sad and can't cheer up, can't sit still and restlessness are the most significant mental health factors in determining the presence or absence of PCOS in an individual, as well as the degree of PCOS. Furthermore, physical factors are more significant than mental health factors in determining PCOS presence and degree in the cohort of female individuals considered for the analysis.

AB The 2D-Cascade-Transeform-Logistic-Sine Map (2D-CTLSM) with good randomness and large parameter chaos range is obtained by improving the Logistic and Sine map in a cascade manner. By combining the chaotic map with DNA coding, an efficient encryption algorithm based on a chaotic map with chunking dislocation and alternate row diffusion is designed. The shortcomings of zigzag itself are overcome by performing different zigzag transformations in chunks while combining DNA encoding to accomplish the diffusion operation. Due to the excellent properties of DNA encoding, the diffusion operation is performed by the DNA computation method with alternate row diffusion so that each value can complete the diffusion operation twice. The simulation experimental results and security analysis show that the algorithm can effectively resist various typical attacks, such as the information entropy is close to the expected value of 8, the correlation coefficient is close to 0, and the NPCR and UACI values can meet the critical value range, and so on. This is a safe and reliable image encryption algorithm.

AB The basic aim of this study is to introduce an innovative concept of bipolar T-spherical fuzzy set (BTSFS) which is a hybrid structure of bipolar fuzzy set (BFS) and T-spherical fuzzy Set (TSFS). BTSFS is a unique type of fuzzy set that works with bipolarity of all membership grades (MGs), that is, truth MG, abstained MG and non-membership grade (NMG). This paper scrutinizes a few basic characteristics and essential operations of BTSFSs. The proposed results are compared with the existing fuzzy structures and also the importance of the proposed work is discussed. Further, the idea of new distance measures of BTSFSs has been presented to investigate the geometrical properties of BPFSs. An example related to pattern recognition (PR) based on new distance measures have been examined in the article. Furthermore, some new similarity measures (SMs) based on BTSFSs such as Dice SM and weighted Dice SM have been initiated. We have also studied the propositions related to proposed SMs. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method based on proposed SMs for BSTSFSs has also been presented in this article. Then, in the end, to check capability and viability, a practical demonstration of the planned approach has also been explained.

AB The present paper introduces a new model of three-way conflict analysis with similarity degree on an issue set. Specifically, we introduce an evaluation of similarity degree, from a relative quantitative point of view, to evaluate the attitude similarity between any two agents. Based on similarity degree, we define a trisection of all pairs of agents on an issue set, and propose a three-level conflict model induced by such a trisection. More importantly, we solve the threshold-selection problem for three-level conflict analysis on multiple issues. We prove that the trisection model (resp. the three-level conflict model) defined in this paper is a conservative extension of the corresponding trisection model (resp. three-level conflict model) defined in Yao 2019 on multiple issues. Therefore, the present paper extends and improves the results of Yao 2019 on multiple issues.

AB The network representation learning task of fusing node multi-dimensional classification information aims to effectively combine node multi-dimensional classification information and network structure information for representation learning, thereby improving the performance of network representation. However, the existing methods only consider multi-dimensional classification information as priori features, which assists the representation learning of the network structure information, lacks the coping mechanism in the case of missing data, and have low robustness in the case of incomplete information. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a representation learning model based on stochastic perturbation and homophily constraint, called IMCIN. On the one hand, the data transformation is carried out through the random perturbation strategy to improve the adaptability of the model to incomplete information. On the other hand, in the process of learning fusion representation vectors, an attribute similarity retention method based on the principle of homogeneity is designed to further mine the effective semantic information in the incomplete information. Experiments show that our method can effectively deal with the problem of incomplete information and improve the performance of node classification and link prediction tasks.

AB Coevolutionary algorithms have demonstrated high performance on many constrained multi-objective prob-lems. However, on some problems with fraudulent constraints or small feasible regions, they may fail to converge to the Pareto front (PF) or even fail to find a feasible solution. To search for feasible solutions robustly for various problems and obtain solutions approaching the PF as possible, this paper proposes a coevolutionary algorithm assisted by two archives. To be specific, a population for minimizing constraint violation and a population for optimizing objectives without constraints coevolve to find a feasible solution first. Then, the feasible solutions are improved by the population with constrained dominance principle and an archive consisting of inversely-updated infeasible solutions. In addition to searching in the feasible regions found so far, the unconstrained population continues searching the objectives without constraints, expecting that new feasible regions can be spotted in the promising regions. To mitigate the issues that small feasible regions may be missed by the unconstrained population, a diversity archive is updated in a larger objective space than the unconstrained population to enhance exploration. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms on 67 problems to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method is very robust in finding feasible solutions and obtains better or competitive performance on most problems.

AB This paper addresses feature selection for regression of high dimensional data, typically spectrometry measure-ments. In some contexts, prior (but partial) knowledge may be available to guide the selection towards some dimensions a priori assumed to be more relevant. We propose a feature selection method making use of this partial supervision. It extends previous works on feature selection with sparsity-enforcing regularised linear models for classification. In the current regularisation context, a practical approximation of this technique reduces to standard Support Vector Regression learning with iterative re-scaling of the inputs. The scaling factors depend here on the prior knowledge but the final selection may depart from it. Practical results on two data sets show the benefits of the proposed approach on the stability, relevance and interpretability of the selected features, as well as regression performances.

AB Automatic vertebral body contour extraction (AVBCE) from heterogeneous spinal MRI is indispensable for the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases. However, AVBCE is challenging due to data heterogeneity, image characteristics complexity, and vertebral body morphology variations, which may cause morphology errors in semantic segmentation. Deep active contour-based (deep ACM-based) methods provide a promising complement for tackling morphology errors by directly parameterizing the contour coordinates. Extending the target contours' capture range and providing morphology-aware parameter maps are crucial for deep ACM-based methods. For this purpose, we propose a novel Attractive Deep Morphology-aware actIve contouR nEtwork (ADMIRE) that embeds an elaborated contour attraction term (CAT) and a comprehensive contour quality (CCQ) loss into the deep ACM-based framework. The CAT adaptively extends the target contours' capture range by designing an all-to-all force field to enable the target contours' energy to contribute to farther locations. Furthermore, the CCQ loss is carefully designed to generate morphology -aware active contour parameters by simultaneously supervising the contour shape, tension, and smoothness. These designs, in cooperation with the deep ACM-based framework, enable robustness to data heterogeneity, image characteristics complexity, and target contour morphology variations. Furthermore, the deep ACM -based ADMIRE is able to cooperate well with semi-supervised strategies such as mean teacher, which enables its function in semi-supervised scenarios. ADMIRE is trained and evaluated on four challenging datasets, including three spinal datasets with more than 1000 heterogeneous images and more than 10000 vertebrae bodies, as well as a cardiac dataset with both normal and pathological cases. Results show ADMIRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, which proves ADMIRE's accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability.

AB The optimal scheduling of energy in a smart grid is crucial to the energy consumption of the entire grid. In fact, for larger grids, intelligent scheduling may result in substantial energy savings. Herein, we introduce an enhanced dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) that utilizes two state variables to derive the optimal power supply schedule. The algorithm accounts for the dynamic states of both batteries and supercapacitors in the power supply system to augment the performance of the dynamic programming model. Additionally, this study incorporates a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model, which integrates various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation to predict grid power consumption. This serves as a mid-point pre-processing step for smart grid energy consumption scheduling. Our simulation experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces energy consumption, surpassing similar grid energy consumption scheduling algorithms. This is critical for the establishment of smart grids and the reduction of energy consumption and emissions.

AB Convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in computer vision, but incorrect predictions would be output when applying intended perturbations on original input. These human-indistinguishable replicas are called adversarial examples, which on this feature can be used to evaluate network robustness and security. White-box attack success rate is considerable, when already knowing network structure and parameters. But in a black-box attack, the adversarial examples success rate is relatively low and the transferability remains to be improved. This article refers to model augmentation which is derived from data augmentation in training generalizable neural networks, and proposes resizing invariance method. The proposed method introduces improved resizing transformation to achieve model augmentation. In addition, ensemble models are used to generate more transferable adversarial examples. Extensive experiments verify the better performance of this method in comparison to other baseline methods including the original model augmentation method, and the black-box attack success rate is improved on both the normal models and defense models.

AB With the continuous development of new technologies, the scale of training data is also expanding. Machine learning algorithms are gradually beginning to be studied and applied in places where the scale of data is relatively large. Because the current structure of learning algorithms only focus on the identification of dependencies and ignores the direction of dependencies, it causes multiple labeled samples not to identify categories. Multiple labels need to be classified using techniques such as machine learning and then applied to solve the problem. In the environment of more training data, it is very meaningful to explore the structure extension to identify the dependencies between attributes and take into account the direction of dependencies. In this article, Bayesian network structure learning, analysis of the shortcomings of traditional algorithms, and binary evolutionary algorithm are applied to the randomized algorithm to generate the initial population. In the optimization process of the algorithm, it uses a Bayesian network to do a local search and uses a depth-first algorithm to break the loop. Finally, it finds a higher score for the network structure. In the simulation experiment, the classic data sets, ALARM and INSURANCE, are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. Compared with NOTEARS and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the weight evaluation index of this article was 4.5% and 7.3% better than other schemes. The clustering effect was improved by 13.5% and 15.2%. The smallest error and the highest accuracy are also better than other schemes. The discussion of Bayesian reasoning in this article has very important theoretical and practical significance. This article further improves the Bayesian network structure and optimizes the performance of the classifier, which plays a very important role in promoting the expansion of the network structure and provides innovative thinking.

DT Article
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are highly computationally efficient artificial intelligence methods due to their advantages in having a biologically plausible computational framework. Recent research has shown that SNN trained using backpropagation (SNN-BP) exhibits excellent performance and has shown great potential in tasks such as image classification and security detection. However, the backpropagation method limits the dynamics and biological plausibility of the neural models in SNN, which will limit the recognition and simulation performance of SNN. In order to make neural models more similar to biological neurons, this study proposes a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with dense intralayer connections, as well as efficient forward and backward processes in BP training. The new model will make the interaction between neurons within the layer more frequent, enhancing the intrinsic information exchange capability of SNN. An effective probabilistic spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) method is also proposed to reduce the overweighted connections between neurons, as well as a hybrid training method using BP and probabilistic STDP. The training method combines the advantages of BP and STDP to improve the performance of SNN models. An intralayer-connected SNN with hybrid training (ISNN-HY) is proposed with the combination of these improvements. The proposed model was evaluated on three static image datasets and one neuromorphic dataset. The results showed that the performance of ISNN-HY is superior to that of other SNN-BP models. The proposed method also makes it possible to accurately simulate biological neural systems.

TI Anomaly Prediction over Human Crowded Scenes via Associate-Based Data
   Mining and K-Ary Tree Hashing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Anomaly detection and behavioral recognition are key research areas widely used to improve human safety. However, in recent times, with the extensive use of surveillance systems and the substantial increase in the volume of recorded scenes, the conventional analysis of categorizing anomalous events has proven to be a difficult task. As a result, machine learning researchers require a smart surveillance system to detect anomalies. This research introduces a robust system for predicting pedestrian anomalies. First, we acquired the crowd data as input from two benchmark datasets (including Avenue and ADOC). Then, different denoising techniques (such as frame conversion, background subtraction, and RGB-to-binary image conversion) for unfiltered data are carried out. Second, texton segmentation is performed to identify human subjects from acquired denoised data. Third, we used Gaussian smoothing and crowd clustering to analyze the multiple subjects from the acquired data for further estimations. The next step is to perform feature extraction to multiple abstract cues from the data. These bag of features include periodic motion, shape autocorrelation, and motion direction flow. Then, the abstracted features are mapped into a single vector in order to apply data optimization and mining techniques. Next, we apply the associate-based mining approach for optimized feature selection. Finally, the resultant vector is served to the k-ary tree hashing classifier to track normal and abnormal activities in pedestrian crowded scenes.

TI Geometric Degree Reduction of Wang-Ball Curves
SO APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING

DT Article
ID MULTI-DEGREE REDUCTION; BEZIER CURVES; CONSTRAINTS
AB There are substantial methods of degree reduction in the literature. Existing methods share some common limitations, such as lack of geometric continuity, complex computations, and one-degree reduction at a time. In this paper, an approximate geometric multidegree reduction algorithm of Wang-Ball curves is proposed. G(0)-, G(1)-, and G(2)-continuity conditions are applied in the degree reduction process to preserve the boundary control points. The general equation for high-order (G(2) and above) multidegree reduction algorithms is nonlinear, and the solutions of these nonlinear systems are quite expensive. In this paper, C-1-continuity conditions are imposed besides the G(2)-continuity conditions. While some existing methods only achieve the multidegree reduction by repeating the one-degree reduction method recursively, our proposed method achieves multidegree reduction at once. The distance between the original curve and the degree-reduced curve is measured with the L-2-norm. Numerical example and figures are presented to state the adequacy of the algorithm. The proposed method not only outperforms the existing method of degree reduction of Wang-Ball curves but also guarantees geometric continuity conditions at the boundary points, which is very important in CAD and geometric modeling.

AB We investigate the consensus problems for uncertain multi-agent systems (MASs) via a neural network (NN) adaptive control approach. However, it is quite difficult because of the existence of NN approximation errors. Unlike existing works that use discontinuous functions to eliminate the effects of NN approximation errors, a novel continuous function is proposed by utilizing the idea of time varying boundary layer technique. Firstly, we design a continuous NN adaptive controller with dynamic coupling strengths for the case with time invariant topology. It is shown that asymptotical consensus can be achieved without requiring any global information. Secondly, we consider time varying communication networks and design a continuous NN adaptive controller with fixed coupling strength. It is shown that the consensus error is ultimately uniformly bounded if the average dwell time is larger than a positive scalar. Finally, two examples are studied to verify the theoretical results, respectively.

AB A lightweight and compliant manipulator design has been considered crucial in safe physical human-robot interaction. Remote actuation relocating the massive parts to the robot base and transmitting power to the distal joint minimizes the actuator inertia and provides series elasticity to the actuator. Rolling diaphragm hydrostatic transmission (RDHT), one of the remote actuation, has recently been studied in physically interacting robots, which can tackle the remaining issues in hydraulic actuation, such as low backdrivability and fluid leakage. However, existing RDHTs are challenging to achieve the desired safety and control performance simultaneously due to their fixed stiffness. This article presents a stiffness-switchable hydrostatic transmission (SwHST) consisting of an RDHT and valve-controlled pneumatic springs. The SwHST has a wide stiffness range of 15-290 N . m/rad and a fast response in stiffness transition of less than 50 ms without any complex stiffness tuning mechanism. It is one of the most efficient transmissions in remote actuation and stiffness adjustment. Its static friction is less than 0.4% of full-range torque, and the stiffness-switching module consumes only 6 W of power when valves are open. The dynamic characteristics of the SwHST are experimentally scrutinized under various operational conditions. Safety performance is verified in unconstrained and constrained collision tests, demonstrating that the SwHST can effectively mitigate the clamping force of more than 50% for both the tests. Control performance is evaluated on position tracking tests. We foresee the proposed SwHST being utilized in human-robot collaboration without jeopardizing con-trol performance through a rapid and efficient stiffness-switching mechanism.

AB A Digital Twin (DT) is a frequently updated virtual representation of a physical or a digital instance that captures its properties of interest. Incorporating both cyber and physical parts to build a digital twin is challenging due to the high complexity of the requirements that should be addressed and satisfied during the design, implementation and operation. In this context, we introduce the MADTwin (Multi-Agent Digital Twin) framework driven by a Multi-agent Systems (MAS) paradigm and supported by flexible architecture and extendible upper ontology for modelling agent-based digital twins. A comprehensive case study of a smart warehouse supported by multi-robots has been presented to show the feasibility and applicability of this framework. The introduced framework powered by intelligent agents integrated with enabler technologies enabled us to cope with parts of the challenges imposed by modelling and integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with digital twins for multi-robots of the smart warehouse. In this framework, different components of CPS (robots) are represented as autonomous physical agents with their digital twin agents in the digital twin environment. Agents act autonomously and cooperatively to achieve their local goals and the objectives of the whole system. Eventually, we discuss the framework's strengths and identify areas of improvement and plans for future work.

TI Expectations over Unspoken Alternatives Predict Pragmatic Inferences
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALAR IMPLICATURE
AB Scalar inferences (SI) are a signature example of how humans interpret language based on unspoken alternatives. While empirical studies have demonstrated that human SI rates are highly variable-both within instances of a single scale, and across different scales-there have been few proposals that quantitatively explain both cross- and within-scale variation. Furthermore, while it is generally assumed that SIs arise through reasoning about unspoken alternatives, it remains debated whether humans reason about alternatives as linguistic forms, or at the level of concepts. Here, we test a shared mechanism explaining SI rates within and across scales: context-driven expectations about the unspoken alternatives. Using neural language models to approximate human predictive distributions, we find that SI rates are captured by the expectedness of the strong scalemate as an alternative. Crucially, however, expectedness robustly predicts cross-scale variation only under a meaning-based view of alternatives. Our results suggest that pragmatic inferences arise from context-driven expectations over alternatives, and these expectations operate at the level of concepts.(1)

AB Human skeletal muscle is widely considered to be the most efficient actuator, leading to extensive research on developing artificial muscles. Bioinspired technologies such as soft robotics and biomimetics are used to produce artificial muscles with performance characteristics similar to those of their biological counterpart. Despite the complexity of human skeletal muscle, advanced engineering materials and unique approaches can help develop an artificial muscle that replicates its kinematic motions. Herein, biomimetic modular artificial muscle (BiMAM), which is the culmination of different design strategies, is presented, and fabrication methods aimed at developing this BiMAM. This chemically driven modular artificial muscle uses shape memory alloy coated with nanomaterials and nano-catalysts. Herein, a high-energy density fuel is employed to actuate this artificial muscle, enabling fast and efficient outputs. Multiple performance characteristics are determined by conducting controlled experiments. Various methods are demonstrated to control the fuel-based valve system and the actuation of the chemically driven artificial muscle. Lastly, to evaluate its functionality, the curling movement of a robotic finger using BiMAM is demonstrated.

TI Learning with noisy labels via logit adjustment based on gradient prior

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Label noise; Loss functions; Gradient prior; Logit adjustment
AB Robust loss functions are crucial for training models with strong generalization capacity in the presence of noisy labels. The commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss function tends to overfit noisy labels, while symmetric losses that are robust to label noise are limited by their symmetry conditions. We conduct an analysis of the gradient of CE and identify the main difficulty posed by label noise: the imbalance of gradient norm among samples. Inspired by long-tail learning, we propose a gradient prior (GP)-based logit adjustment method to mitigate the impact of label noise. This method makes full use of the gradient of samples to adjust the logit, enabling DNNs to effectively ignore noisy samples and instead focus more on learning hard samples. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of CE and outperforms existing methods, especially in the case of symmetric noise. Experiments on the object detection dataset Pascal VOC further verify the plug-and-play and effective robustness of our method.

ID EFFICIENCY; RESOLUTION
AB Although deep-learning based video super-resolution (VSR) studies have achieved excellent progress in recent years, the majority of them do not take into account the impact of lossy compression. A large number of real-world videos are characterized by compression artifacts (e.g., blocking, ringing, and blurring) due to transmission bandwidth or storage capacity limitations, which makes the VSR task more challenging. To balance compression artifacts reduction and detail preservation, this paper proposes a nonlocal-guided enhanced interaction spatial-temporal network for compressed video super-resolution (EISTNet). EISTNet consists of the nonlocal-guided enhanced interaction feature extraction module (EIFEM) and the attention-based multi-channel feature self-calibration module (MCFSM). The pixel-shuffle-based nonlocal feature guidance module (PNFGM) is designed to explore the nonlocal similarity of video sequences and then it is used to guide the extraction and fusion of inter-frame spatial-temporal information in EIFEM. Considering that compression noise and video content are strongly correlated, MCFSM introduces features from the compression artifacts reduction stage for recalibration and adaptive fusion, which closely associates the two parts of the network. To reduce the computational memory pressure on nonlocal modules, we add pixel-shuffle operation to PNFGM, which also expands its receptive field. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared to the existing methods.

ID MODEL
AB At present, image completion models are often used to handle images in public datasets and are not competent for tasks in practical scenarios such as USV scenes. On one hand, the practical missing regions are often located at the boundaries, which presents a challenge for the model to extract image features. On the other hand, real images are often blurred, and filling the content without optimizing the image quality will limit the application of completed images. To address these challenges, a novel image completion model using an attention mechanism and a joint enhancive discriminator, which can effectively fill in the missing and enhance the image quality in various missing situations, has been proposed in this paper. First, an attention mechanism is used as the condition of the generator to extract the related missing information according to different weights. To ensure that the output of the algorithm is semantically consistent with the original image and has a higher quality than the original image, a joint discriminator is introduced to constrain the conditional generator from different aspects. In particular, the cloud model (a cognitive model) in the joint enhancive discriminator can promote the quality and practicability of the generated images. Experimental results show that our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art models in both qualitative and quantitative measurements on four public datasets and one USV real dataset. Compared with the baselines, our method has an average improvement of 4.90% and 1.00% in image completion evaluation and image quality evaluation, respectively. We also verify the performance of our model for practical application in real scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/wrq-cqupt/IC.

AB Traffic volume (i.e., the volumes of cars, bikes and crowds) demonstrates real-time traffic hotspots and city transportation movement patterns, whose prediction is of great significance in traffic management and urban construction. The accurate prediction of traffic volume, however, is a challenging problem, and is essentially a spatiotemporal phenomenon affected by complex factors. In this paper, in addition to the spatiotemporal correlations between adjacent space and time, three significant traffic volume prediction observations are concluded: (1) variations in traffic volume in different directions have different regularities; (2) point of interests (POIs) have great impact on the variations of traffic volume in the spatial dimension; and (3) the rule of daily changes significantly affects short-term traffic volume in the temporal dimension. Inspired by the above observations, a novel multidirectional spatiotemporal network (MDSTN) is proposed for short-term traffic volume prediction. Specifically, traffic volume is divided into four directions, i.e., heading upwards, leftwards, downwards and rightwards, and all further analyses are performed in four directions. Meanwhile, traffic volume is combined with POI signals and time signals to augment the spatial and temporal characteristics. In particular, a POI attention mechanism is designed to adaptively extract the contribution of different POIs to traffic volume, and 3D convolutions are adopted to address the temporal variations in traffic volume. In addition, residual units are employed to eliminate gradient vanishing and exploding caused by the network depth increment, and batch normalization is adopted to adaptively remove the correlation between parallel neural units. Comparison experiments with real-life electric bicycle trajectories and the NYCBike dataset demonstrate that MDSTN vastly outperforms all baselines.

AB Robustness of modern information confidentiality algorithm depends on its individual components. Modern block ciphers highly depend on two components namely confusion and diffusion. These two main characteristics in any modern cipher are achieved by substitution and permutation boxes. In this article, a decision-making algorithm is utilized for the selection of optimum substitution box (S-box), which plays a significant role in the field of information confidentiality. For this purpose, an interval-based Pythagorean fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (IVPF-TOPSIS) method is introduced to get the desired nonlinear confusion component of block cipher namely S-box. In this manner, we performed cryptographic analyses of standard S-boxes namely nonlinearity (NL), strict avalanche criterion (SAC), bit-independent criterion (BIC), absolute indicator (ABI), the sum of square and absolute indicator (SSAI), algebraic degree (AD), algebraic immunity (AI), transparency order (TO), composite algebraic immunity (CAI), robustness (RB), signal to noise ratio (SNR), confusion coefficient of variance (CCV). With these cryptographic characteristics, we have used interval-valued based Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making technique to classify standard S-boxes suitable for construction of modern block ciphers.

AB The augmented randomized complete block design (ARCBD) is widely used in plant breeding programs to screen numerous new treatments. The error variance is estimated based on the replicated control treatments run over a randomized complete block design and is used to test the new treatments that are administrated each once in the extended units of the blocks. However, one or more observations corresponding to the control treatments may be missed in experiments, making difficulties, e.g., biased estimates. An approximate common approach to deal with this problem is the imputation of the estimated value which is with some uncertainties. Moreover, in real-life experiments, there are more sources of uncertainty that cause conflict-indeterminate, vague, imprecise, and erroneous data that increases the complexity of the analysis. In this paper, an exact scheme is utilized to deal with a missing control treatment in ARCBD. To overcome the problem of indeterminacies in data, a novel neutrosophic analysis approach is proposed. Specifically, the problem of a missing value in an ARCBD for an uncertain environment is resolved analytically by considering an augmented incomplete block design in the framework of neutrosophic statistics so-called neutrosophic augmented randomized complete block design (NARCBD). In this approach, by proposing the neutrosophic model, the neutrosophic estimations as well as the mathematical neutrosophic adjusted sums of squares are derived and the analysis of variance table is provided. The new model is applied to the neutrosophic genotype data example of safflower and assessed by a simulation study. Furthermore, a code in the R software was written to analyze the data based on the proposed approach to fill the calculation gap for data analysis in NARCBD with a missing value. In light of the results observed, it can be concluded that the neutrosophic exact proposed method performs better than the classic in the presence of uncertainty.

AB Large-scale multi-objective feature selection problems are widely existing in the fields of text classification, image processing, and biological omics. Numerous features usually mean more correlation and redundancy between features, so effective features are usually sparse. SparseEA is an evolutionary algorithm for solving Large-scale Sparse Multi-objective Optimization Problems (i.e., most decision variables of the optimal solutions are zero). It determines feature Scores by calculating the fitness of individual features, which does not reflect the correlation between features well. In this manuscript, ReliefF was used to calculate the weights of features, with unimportant features being removed first. Then combine the weights calculated by ReliefF with Scores of SparseEA to guide the evolution process. Moreover, the Scores of features remain constant throughout all runs in SparseEA. Therefore, the fitness values of excellent and poor individuals in each iteration are used to update the Scores. In addition, difference operators of Differential Evolution are introduced into SparseEA to increase the diversity of solutions and help the algorithm jump out of the local optimal solution. Comparative experiments are performed on large-scale datasets selected from scikit-feature repository. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the original SparseEA and the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Security of Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) networks has evolved as a vital issue in recent years. The IoMT networks are designed to link patients with caregivers. All reports, data, and medical signals are transferred over these networks. Hence, these networks require robust and secure access strategies for patients to send their vital data or reports. Hence, hacking of these networks may lead to harmful effects on patients. One of the vulnerable points to hacking in these networks is the access point. Access to these networks could be performed with biometrics. The popular biometric traits for this purpose are biomedical signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as they are continuously monitored and measured for patients. A common thread between all biometric authentication systems is the possibility of losing the biometric traits forever if hacking attempts manage to concur the biometric template storage. A new trend in the field of biometric authentication is to avoid the utilization of original biometrics in access control processes. A possible alternative is to use cancelable biometrics instead. Cancelable biometrics can be generated through encryption schemes or non-invertible transforms. This paper adopts both strategies in a unified framework for cancelable ECG signal recognition that can be used in the access step of IoMT networks. The proposed framework begins with applying a non-invertible transformation on the ECG signals through fuzzy logic to change the dynamic range of the signals. As this process is non-invertible in nature, it prevents the recovery of the original ECG signals from the processed versions, which is the main target of cancelable biometric systems. After that, lightweight encryption through XOR operation with user-specific patterns is implemented. Here, the high complexity of full encryption schemes that need a large processing burden is eliminated. The addition of the encryption stage enhances the security of cancelable biometric traits, allowing a hybrid nature of the proposed cancelable biometric framework through the merging of non-invertible transforms and encryption algorithms. Moreover, an FPGA hardware implementation is introduced for real implementation of the proposed ECG-based cancelable biometric recognition framework. This hardware can accompany the user to allow access of the IoMT network when requested. Experimental results show a promising performance of the proposed framework with a large Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AROC) of 99.5% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.058%.

AB Efficient allocating and scheduling emergency rescue tasks are a primary issue for emergency management. This paper considers emergency scheduling of rescue tasks under stochastic deterioration of the injured. First, a mathematical model is established to minimize the average mathematical expectation of all tasks' completion time and casualty loss. Second, an improved multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (IMEDA) is proposed to solve this problem. In the IMDEA, an effective initialization strategy is designed for obtaining a superior population. Then, three statistical models are constructed, which include two tasks existing in the same rescue team, the probability of first task being processed by a rescue team, and the adjacency between two tasks. Afterward, an improved sampling method based on referenced sequence is employed to efficiently generate offspring population. Three multi-objective local search methods are presented to improve the exploitation in promising areas around elite individuals. Furthermore, the parameter calibration and effectiveness of components of IMEDA are tested through experiments. Finally, the comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms demonstrates that IMEDA is a high-performing approach for the considered problem.

   Uncertainty guided learning; Pre-training student
AB Recovering the global accurate complex physics field from limited sensors is critical to the measurement and control of the engineering system. General reconstruction methods for recovering the field, especially the deep learning with more parameters and better representational ability, usually require large amounts of labeled data which is unaffordable in practice. To solve the problem, this paper proposes uncertainty guided ensemble self-training (UGE-ST), using plentiful unlabeled data to improve reconstruction performance and reduce the required labeled data. A novel self-training framework with the ensemble teacher and pre-training student designed to improve the accuracy of the pseudo-label and remedy the impact of noise is first proposed. On the other hand, uncertainty guided learning is proposed to encourage the model to focus on the highly confident regions of pseudo-labels and mitigate the effects of wrong pseudo-labeling in self-training, improving the performance of the reconstruction model. Experiments including the airfoil velocity and pressure field reconstruction and the electronic components' temperature field reconstruction indicate that our UGE-ST can save up to 90% of the data with the same accuracy as supervised learning.

ID EQUALITIES
AB We study a constraint propagation algorithm to detect infeasibility of a system of linear inequalities over continuous variables, which we call activity propagation. Each iteration of this algorithm chooses a subset of the inequalities and if it infers that some of them are always active (i.e., always hold with equality), it turns them into equalities. We show that this algorithm can be described as chaotic iterations and its fixed points can be characterized by a local consistency, in a similar way to traditional local consistency methods in CSP such as arc consistency. Via complementary slackness, activity propagation can be employed to iteratively improve a dual-feasible solution of large-scale linear programs in a primal-dual loop - a special case of this method is the Virtual Arc Consistency algorithm by Cooper et al. As our second contribution, we show that this method has the same set of fixed points as block-coordinate descent (BCD) applied to the dual linear program. While BCD is popular in large-scale optimization, its fixed points need not be global optima even for convex problems and a succinct characterization of convex problems optimally solvable by BCD remains elusive. Our result may open the way for such a characterization since it allows us to characterize BCD fixed points in terms of local consistencies.

AB According to the fact that single-modal data usually contain limited information, a great deal of effort has been devoted to making use of the complementary information contained in the multi-modal data on various patterns. Thus, this paper is concerned with an object detection method that can fully utilize multi-modal data. First, the method introduces the transformer mechanism to realize the fusion of intra-modal and inter-modal features of different modal data. The aim is to take advantage of the complementarity of data between modalities, which helps to improve the performance of multi-modal object detection. Second, a contrastive loss suitable for contrastive learning is applied. This enables the authors to effectively utilize label information. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple object detection datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices are connected in edge-cloud environment, and spectrum scarcity has become a major bottleneck for the employment of IoT devices in the end side of cloud computing. In addition, due to the broadcast nature of RF link, the potential eavesdropper may be presented in the wireless environment. To improve spectrum efficiency (SE) and ensure safe transmission of the users, in this paper, the two-way relay cooperative Cognitive Radio Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (CR-NOMA) with massive multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) is proposed. Our objective is to maximize the security energy efficiency (SEE) of the cognitive system subject to the quality of service (QoS) of users. Specifically, the multi-objective optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., the optimization of transmit power, power allocation, and antenna selection, respectively. The Lagrange dual algorithm based on the first-order Taylor series expansion function is proposed to solve the non-convex problem. Moreover, a novel orthogonal antenna selection algorithm is proposed to decrease the cost of radio frequency chains and limit the interference to the primary user. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has significant performance gain on SEE. It can effectively increase the number of access for cloud computing edge IoT users. In addition, due to the impact of correlation between the antennas, as the number of relay antennas increases, the SEE converges to a specific value, which exists the optimal number of antenna.

ID STATISTICS
AB Despite remarkable success has been achieved by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), there still exist many challenges in improving the performance of IQA for authentically distorted images. An important factor is that the insufficient annotated data limits the training of high-capacity CNNs to accommodate diverse distortions, complicated semantic structures and high-variance quality scores of these images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical curriculum learning (HCL) framework for NR-IQA. The main idea of the proposed framework is to leverage the external data to learn the prior knowledge about IQA widely and progressively. Specifically, as a closely-related task with NR-IQA, image restoration is used as the first curriculum to learn the image quality related knowledge (i.e., semantic and distortion information) on massive distorted-reference image pairs. Then multiple lightweight subnetworks are designed to learn human scoring rules on multiple available synthetic IQA datasets independently, and a cross-dataset quality assessment correlation (CQAC) module is proposed to fully explore the similarities and diversities of different scoring rules. Finally, the whole model is fine-tuned on the target authentic IQA dataset to fuse the learned knowledge and adapt to the target data distribution. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard authentic IQA datasets. Moreover, the generalization of our model is fully validated by the cross-dataset evaluation and the gMAD competition. In addition, extensive analyses prove that the proposed HCL framework is effective in improving the performance of our model.

TI Hierarchical Attention-Based Sensor Fusion Strategy for Depth Estimation

DE Adaptive sensor fusion; depth estimation; diverse weather; attention
   mechanism
ID LASER; LIDAR
AB In this paper, we propose a hierarchical attention-based sensor fusion strategy for depth estimation under various weather conditions. Multiple-sensor fusion is proven as a promising solution for predicting accurate depth maps in diverse weather conditions, especially for extreme weather conditions. However, most of the current studies simply fuse the information from different sensors without jointly considering the difference in their performance at the sensor level and feature level. To fill this gap, our hierarchical attention-based fusion strategy uses two attention mask-generation modules that weigh sensor data from branches (i.e. different sensors) and features. With the cooperation of these two masks, our system is able to determine the adaptive contribution of each sensor as well as the individual contribution of each feature in the sensor regarding their performance in different weather. We compare the proposed methods with the baseline, i.e. the late fusion Sparse-to-Dense model, and two extended models individually with the branch-wise-only and feature-wise-only masks. The results show a robust and superior performance of our methods even in clear environments where the baseline already performs well enough. Moreover, we investigate the performance of RGB camera, radar, and LiDAR in foggy environments comprehensively by visualizing the generated mask. Our results show a significantly increased importance of radar sensors in extreme weather conditions, e.g. dense fog.

DE Video captioning; memory-augmented transformer; attention mechanisms;
   hierarchical graph-based video summarization
AB A coherent description is an ultimate goal regarding video captioning via a couple of sentences because it might also affect the consistency and intelligibility of the generated results. In this context, a paragraph describing a video is affected by the activities used to both produce its specific narrative and provide some clues that can also assist in decreasing textual repetition. This work proposes a model, named Hierarchical time-aware Summarization with an Adaptive Transformer (HSAT), that uses a strategy to enhance the frame selection reducing the amount of information that needed to be processed along with attention mechanisms to enhance a memory-augmented transformer. This new approach increases the coherence among the generated sentences, assessing data importance (about the video segments) contained in the self-attention results and uses that to improve readability using only a small fraction of time spent by the other methods. The test results show the potential of this new approach as it provides higher coherence among the various video segments, decreasing the repetition in the generated sentences and improving the description diversity in the ActivityNet Captions dataset.

TI Class-Aware Pseudo-Labeling for Non-Random Missing Labels in
   Semi-Supervised Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEMANTIC COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Semi-supervised learning; missing label not at random
AB Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a classic missing label problem. Existing SSL algorithms always rely on the basic assumption, label missing completely at random (MCAR), where both labeled and unlabeled data share the same class distribution. Compared to MCAR, the label missing not at random (MNAR) problem is more realistic. In MNAR, the labeled and unlabeled data have different class distributions resulting in biased label imputation, which leads to the performance degradation of SSL models. Existing SSL algorithms can hardly perform well on tail classes (the classes with few training examples) in MNAR setting, since the pseudo-labels learned from unlabeled data tend to be biased toward head classes (the classes with a large number of training examples). To alleviate this issue, we propose a class-aware pseudo-labeling (CAPL) for non-random missing labels in SSL, which utilizes the unlabeled data by dynamically adjusting the threshold for selecting pseudo-labels. Under various MNAR settings, our method achieves up to 15.0% overall accuracy gain upon FixMatch in CIFAR-10 compared with existing baselines.

AB In this work, we proposed and developed an approach for markerless object detection and registration in augmented reality. Our system enables the superimposition of videos or 3D graphics on natural objects in a real-time tracking process. The object of interest is detected within a sequence of images using the feature points and their invariant descriptors. The matching process between the test image and the training images is calculated using a 2D homography to generate the projective transformation for the video registration part. Further, the 3D graphic is overlaid into the scene by estimating the real camera pose and solving transformations relating the virtual and the real reference frames. The conducted experiments provided accurate and time effective results. Our approach detects and tracks markerless objects in real-time and enables video and 3D models registration for augmented reality experiences.

AB This study proposes a dynamic simulation-based framework that utilizes swarm intelligence algorithms to optimize the design of hybrid assembly lines in the automotive industry. Two recent discrete versions of Whale Optimization Algorithm (named VNS-DWOA) and Gorilla Troops Optimizer (named DGTO) were developed to solve the assembly line balancing problem. The effectiveness of these algorithms was compared to six conventional meta-heuristics as well as the solution proposed by process design experts. The experimental results show that our methods outperform the conventional meta-heuristics and achieve comparable or better results than the experts' solution. Particulary, VNS-DWOA, being the top performer, has consistently provided averagely remarkable enhancements of cycle time, ranging from 7% when compared to the process expert's solution to 20% maximum improvement compared to all other methods. The findings of this study highlight the effectiveness of utilizing swarm intelligence algorithms and dynamic simulation-based frameworks as well as the potential benefits of implementing these digital methods in industrial settings, as they can significantly accelerate and enhance the optimization of assembly line design particularly and reduce time to market generally.

AB Urban traffic congestion is of utmost importance for modern societies due to population and economic growth. Thus, it contributes to environmental problems like increasing greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution. Improved traffic flow in urban networks relies heavily on traffic signal control. Hence, optimizing cycle timing at many intersections is paramount to reducing congestion and increasing sustainability. This paper introduces an alternative to conventional traffic signal control, EcoLight+, which incorporates future noise predictions with the deep dueling Q-network reinforcement Learning algorithm to reduce noise levels, CO2 emissions, and fuel consumption. An innovative data fusion approach is also proposed to improve our LSTM-based noise prediction model by integrating heterogeneous data from different sources. Our proposed solution allows the system to achieve higher efficiency than its competitors based on real-world data from Tallinn, Estonia.

AB In China, post-loan management is usually executed in the form of a visit survey conducted by a credit manager. Through a quarterly visit survey, a large number of loan audit short texts, which contain valuable information for evaluating the credit status of small and micro enterprises, are collected. However, methods for analysing this type of short text remain lacking. This study proposes a method for processing short loan audit texts called fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA). This method first transforms short texts into a fuzzy matrix through lexical analysis; it then calculates the similarity between records based on each fuzzy matrix and constructs an association graph with this similarity. Finally, it uses a prism minimum spanning tree to extract clusters based on different a cuts. Experiments using actual data from a commercial bank in China revealed that the FCA yields suitable clustering results when handling loan audit briefs. Moreover, it exhibited superior performance compared to BIRCH, k-means, and fuzzy c-means.

TI Masked transformer through knowledge distillation for unsupervised text
   style transfer
SO NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING

DT Article; Early Access
DE Evaluation; Machine learning; Natural language generation; Style
   transfer
AB Text style transfer (TST) aims at automatically changing a text's stylistic features, such as formality, sentiment, authorial style, humor, and complexity, while still trying to preserve its content. Although the scientific community has investigated TST since the 1980s, it has recently regained attention by adopting deep unsupervised strategies to address the challenge of training without parallel data. In this manuscript, we investigate how relying on sequence-to-sequence pretraining models affects the performance of TST when the pretraining step leverages pairs of paraphrase data. Furthermore, we propose a new technique to enhance the sequence-to-sequence model by distilling knowledge from masked language models. We evaluate our proposals on three unsupervised style transfer tasks with widely used benchmarks: author imitation, formality transfer, and polarity swap. The evaluation relies on quantitative and qualitative analyses and comparisons with the results of state-of-the-art models. For the author imitation and the formality transfer task, we show that using the proposed techniques improves all measured metrics and leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in content preservation and an overall score in the author imitation domain. In the formality transfer domain, we paired with the SOTA method in the style control metric. Regarding the polarity swap domain, we show that the knowledge distillation component improves all measured metrics. The paraphrase pretraining increases content preservation at the expense of harming style control. Based on the results reached in these domains, we also discuss in the manuscript if the tasks we address have the same nature and should be equally treated as TST tasks.

AB The integration of demand response programs (DRPs) into the energy management (EM) system of microgrids (MGs) helps in improving the load characteristics by allowing consumers to interoperate for achieving techno-economic advantages. In this paper, an improved algorithm is called LINFO is proposed for modifying search ability of the original weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) algorithm as well as avoiding its weaknesses like trapping in a local optima. The improved algorithm's efficiency is confirmed by comparing its results with those obtained by the original INFO and other optimization techniques using different standard benchmark test functions. Moreover, this improved algorithm and the original version are applied for solving the EM problem with the aim of optimizing the operation cost of the MGs in the presence DRPs. They are used to solve day-ahead EM problem for optimal operation of renewable energy resources, the optimal generation from a conventional diesel engines (DEs); taking into account the participation of customers in DRP for minimizing MG operating cost, which includes the cost of DEs fuel and the power transactions cost with the main grid. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LINFO, simulation results are compared with the results of well-known and newly developed optimization techniques.

DE Cross-lingual passage re-ranking; Domain adaptation; Knowledge
   distillation; Adversarial learning
AB For a given query, the objective of Cross-lingual Passage Re-ranking (XPR) is to rank a list of candidate passages in multiple languages, where only a portion of the passages are in the query's language. Multilingual BERT (mBERT) is often used for the XPR task and achieves impressive performance. Nevertheless, there still exist two essential issues to be addressed in mBERT, including the performance gap between high- and low-resource languages, and the lack of explicit embedding distribution alignment. Regarding each language as a separated domain, we theoretically explore how these problems lead to errors in XPR under the guidance of domain adaptation. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel framework that comprises two modules, namely knowledge distillation and adversarial learning. The former enables the knowledge to be transferred from high-resource languages to low-resource ones, narrowing their performance gap. The latter encourages mBERT to align the embedding distributions across different languages by utilizing a novel language-distinguish task and adversarial training. Extensive experiments on in-domain and out-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework and show that it can outperform state-of-the-art methods.

ID EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION
AB Accurate financial time series forecasting is important in financial markets. However, for financial time series with low fluctuation, there is an unusual forecasting phenomenon in the popular recurrent network model forecasting, with the predictive value lagging the truth value. We call this phenomenon the lagging problem. This study proposes new evaluation measures for assessing the lagging problem, including lagging relative error, lagging value error, and lagging trend error. Moreover, the state analysis method and linear fitting model are developed to explain the causes of the lagging problem. Experimental results show that all popular recurrent network models adopted suffer from the lagging problem. This problem is caused by the failure of the nonlinear function in the prediction model and the linear degeneration of the prediction model thereafter, resulting in the suppression of the nonlinear fitting ability.

AB One of the most reliable indicators of the amount and condition of organic matter in a basin is the total organic carbon (TOC) content of rock samples. The manual estimation primarily involves inspecting rock samples for organic carbon analysis. However, this method is costly and time-consuming due to the necessity of collecting samples from a wide range of well intervals within the source rocks. Consequently, studies have been conducted to facilitate this process. Emerging alternative methods for estimating TOC involve utilizing well logs and stratigraphic analysis data in conjunction with machine learning (ML) algorithms. Recent studies advocate for the application of ML algorithms in estimating TOC. The model parameters were selected using a metaheuristics approach and cross-validation to enhance the model's flexibility. This computational technique enables the identification of models with greater generalization potential. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), extreme learning machines, Elastic Net, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were employed for the estimation of TOC. The suggested data intelligent framework was validated using samples from various sedimentary basins. In several metrics investigations, the CNN model exhibits notable distinctions against the other models, highlighting its potential to assist geologists in predicting concentrations of total organic carbon.

AB Multi-objective optimization (MOO) issues that are encountered in the realm of real engineering applications are characterized by the curse of economically or computationally expensive objectives, which can strike insufficient performance evaluations for optimization methods to converge to Pareto optimal front (POF). To address these concerns, this paper develops a guided multi-objective golden jackal optimization (MOGJO) to promote the coverage and convergence capabilities toward the true POF while solving MOO issues. MOGJO embeds four reproduction stages during the seeking process. Firstly, the population of golden jackals is initialized according to the operational search space and then the updating process is performed. Secondly, an opposition-based learning scheme is adopted to improve the coverage of the Pareto optimal solutions. Thirdly, an elite-based guiding strategy is incorporated to guide the leader golden jackal toward the promising areas within the search space and then promote the convergence propensity. Finally, the crowding distance is also integrated to provide a better compromise among the diversity and convergence of the searched POF. To evaluate the MOGJO's performance, it is analyzed against sixteen frequently utilized unconstrained MOO issues, five complex constrained problems, four constrained engineering designs, and real dynamic economic-emission power dispatch (DEEPD) problem. The experimental results are performed using the generational distance (GD), hypervolume (HV), spacing (SP) metrics to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods, which affirms the progressive and competitive performance compared to thirteen state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the results of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with reference to GD and HV exhibited that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the compared methods, with a 95% significance level. Furthermore, the results of the nonparametric Friedman test were performed to detect the significant of average ranking among the compared algorithm, where the results confirmed that the proposed MOGJO outperforms the best algorithm among thirteen state-of-the-art algorithms by an average rank of Friedman test greater than 41% while outperforming the worst one, MOALO, by 84% for ZDT and DTLZ1 suits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm saved the overall energy cost and total emission of the DEEPD problem by 1.89%, and 1.48%, respectively, compared with the best existing results and thus, it is commended to adopt for new applications.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB The information transfer mechanism within the population is an essential factor for population-based multiobjective optimization algorithms. An efficient leader selection strategy can effectively help the population to approach the true Pareto front. However, traditional population-based multiobjective optimization algorithms are restricted to a single global leader and cannot transfer information efficiently. To overcome those limitations, in this paper, a multiobjective bacterial colony optimization with dynamic multi-leader co-evolution (MBCO/DML) is proposed, and a novel information transfer mechanism is developed within the group for adaptive evolution. Specifically, to enhance convergence and diversity, a multi-leaders learning mechanism is designed based on a dynamically evolving elite archive via direction-based hierarchical clustering. Finally, adaptive bacterial elimination is proposed to enable bacteria to escape from the local Pareto front according to convergence status. The results of numerical experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with related population-based multiobjective optimization algorithms on 24 frequently used benchmarks. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our dynamic leader selection in information transfer for improving both convergence and diversity to solve multiobjective optimization problems, which plays a significant role in information transfer of population evolution. Furthermore, we confirm the validity of the co-evolution framework to the bacterial-based optimization algorithm, greatly enhancing the searching capability for bacterial colony.

AB In many practical situations, the theory of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets has proven to be a more effective tool for handling high levels of uncertainty than intuitionistic, Pythagorean, and Fermatean fuzzy sets; as a result, it is a fundamental part of many mathematical hybrid decision-making models for handling such challenging decisive situations. The fuzzy parameterized soft sets and their extensions are more effective at handling situations where some of the parameters are strongly preferred over others, which allows for more precise decision-making. Similar to this, soft expert sets, as an effective approach, offer the capability of taking into account many experts' opinions in one place for multiattribute group decision-making situations. The goal of this study is to substantially improve decision-makers' capacity for collecting their judgment over a wider range of situations. To accomplish this, we present the idea of the n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy soft expert set (n,m-ROFSES) model by combining n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy sets and soft expert sets in order to handle more generalized information. The created model is a successful extension of fuzzy parameterized q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft expert sets (FPq ROFSESs). In addition, several of its fundamental concepts, such as subset, complement, union, and intersection are discussed and demonstrated with examples. Due to its benefits over other warm production methods and the world's rapidly expanding population, heating technology is having an ever-growing global influence. As a result of the increased demand for heating systems, numerous new manufacturers have emerged. Choosing the best technology solution is a difficult decision for suppliers or sale dealers. In order to tackle these issues, we offer a multi-criteria group decision-making algorithm whose authenticity and efficacy are carefully verified. We investigate the use of this approach in reality, that is, the selection of a suitable brand of heating system. At last, a comparison of the initiated model with some existing approaches is presented to verify its advantages over them.

AB Arguably, a desirable feature of a learner is that its performance gets better with an increasing amount of training data, at least in expectation. This issue has received renewed attention in recent years and some curious and surprising findings have been reported on. In essence, these results show that more data does actually not necessarily lead to improved performance-worse even, performance can deteriorate. Clustering, however, has not been subjected to such kind of study up to now. This paper shows that k-means clustering, a ubiquitous technique in machine learning and data mining, suffers from the same lack of so-called monotonicity and can display deterioration in expected performance with increasing training set sizes. Our main, theoretical contributions prove that 1-means clustering is monotonic, while 2-means is not even weakly monotonic, i.e., the occurrence of nonmonotonic behavior persists indefinitely, beyond any training sample size. For larger k, the question remains open.

TI Canonical mean filter for almost zero-shot multi-task classification
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Adaptation; Feature reuse; Support set
AB The support set plays a key role in providing conditional prior for fast adapting the feature extractors in few-shot tasks. The representative few-shot method CNAPs used a simple conditional feature encoder to extract the prior, which was a conditional feature of the task-specific support set. However, the strict form required by the support set makes its construction difficult in practical applications. Motivated by ANIL, we first investigate the role of the adaption in CNAPs by designing Almost Zero-Shot (AZS) tasks in which a fixed support set is used across all tasks instead of the task-specific support set. The AZS experimental results indicate that the adaptation contributes little to the feature extractor. Nevertheless, simply removing the adaptation from CNAPs will cause severe performance drop on some sub-datasets of the Meta-Dataset. To alleviate this problem, we further proposed a Canonical Mean Filter (CMF) module that maps any support set to a canonical form. The CMF yields a stable conditional feature, and hence allows for CNAPs to perform well without the conditional feature encoder and the parameter adaptation network at the test stage. CNAPs embedded with CMF significantly outperform the vanilla CNAPs for the AZS tasks, and even achieve comparable performance to one-shot tasks but with 40.48% parameter reduction and without task-specific support sets at the test stage.

DE Fault diagnosis; Few-shot; Cross-domain; Deep subdomain adaptation;
   Convolutional neural network
AB Most existing cross-domain intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms rely on many samples and only consider the global alignment of all faults. It is not practical to obtain numerous fault samples under actual working conditions. Therefore, it is a great challenge to fully utilize the fine-grained information of each type of fault to improve the fault diagnosis performance of the model under few-shot conditions. To ease this challenge, we develop a novel deep subdomain adaptation intelligent fault diagnosis (DSAIFD) model. First, a convolutional neural network is pretrained using the source domain to extract cross-domain invariant features. Second, we propose an effective class center alignment method to facilitate deep subdomain adaptation, which improves the fault diagnosis performance of the model. By combining the class center alignment method with conditional adversarial networks, the proposed model can fully utilize the fine-grained information of subclasses and reduce the distribution discrepancy between two domains. Last, high-confidence samples are selected from the target domain by setting an adaptive threshold. These selected samples are combined with the training samples from the source domain to train a classifier, which alleviates the problem of insufficient sample size. The experiments show that DSAIFD achieves significant results on two validation datasets.

AB Timely and accurate detection and diagnosis of heart disorders is a significant problem in the medical community since the mortality rate is increasing. Pulsing of cardiac structures and blood turbulence creates heart sounds recorded and detected through Phonococardiogram (PCG). As a non-invasive technique, PCG signals have a strong ability to be used for designing automatic classification of possible heart disorders. This paper presents an expert system design for the detection and classification of PCG signals for five classes, namely, healthy, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and mitral valve prolapse. In this work, a single-channel PCG signal is first decomposed using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) into different modes known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Manual signal analysis is applied to identify the relevant IMFs to construct a preprocessed signal. We proposed an automated energy-based signal reconstruction through IMFs. The proposed algorithms automatically identify the relevant IMFs and added them together to form a preprocessed signal. After preprocessing, the first nine features of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) were computed and passed to several classification methods such as Fine Tree, Quadratic Discriminant, Kernel Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Fine K-Nearest Neighbours (Fine-KNN), Ensemble Bagged Trees and Neural Network. The best performance of 99.3% accuracy was obtained via Fine-KNN using 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed method was evaluated on a publicly available dataset of heart sounds. The proposed method demonstrated improved performance as compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, a new approach to visual geo-localization for natural environments is proposed. The digital elevation model (DEM) data in virtual space is rendered and construct a panoramic skyline database is constructed. By combining the skyline database with real-world image data (used as the "queries" to be localized), visual geo-localization is treated as a cross-modal image retrieval problem for panoramic skyline images, creating a unique new visual geo-localization benchmark for the natural environment. Specifically, the semantic segmentation model named LineNet is proposed, for skyline extractions from query images, which has proven to be robust to a variety of complex natural environments. On the aforementioned benchmarks, the fully automatic method is elaborated for large-scale cross-modal localization using panoramic skyline images. Finally, the compound index is delicately designed to reduce the storage space of the positioning global descriptors and improve the retrieval efficiency. Moreover, the proposed method is proven to outperform most state-of-the-art methods.

AB With the rapid development of image editing technology, tampering with images has become easier. Maliciously tampered images lead to serious security problems (e.g., when used as evidence). The current mainstream methods of image tampering are divided into three types which are copy-move, splicing and removal. Many image tampering detection methods can only detect one type of image tampering. Additionally, some methods learn features by suppressing image content, which can result in false positives when identifying tampered areas. In this paper, the authors propose a novel framework named the dual supervision neural network (DS-Net) to localize the tampered regions of images tampered by the three tampering methods mentioned above. First, to extract richer multiscale information, the authors add skip connections to the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module. Second, a channel attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically weigh the results generated by ASPP. Finally, the authors build additional supervised branches for high-level features to further enhance the extraction of these high-level features before fusing them with low-level features. The authors conduct experiments on various standard datasets. Through extensive experiments, the results show that the AUC scores reach 86.4%, 95.3% and 99.6% for CASIA, COVERAGE and NIST16 datasets, respectively, and the F1 scores are 56.0%, 73.4% and 82.7%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the authors' method can accurately locate tampered regions and achieve better performance on various datasets than other methods of the same type.

AB An inherent problem in software engineering is that competing prediction systems have been found to produce conflicting results. Yet accurate prediction is crucial because the complexity and quality of software requirements have dramatically changed in recent years, and consumers have become considerably more demanding in terms of the cost, timeframe, and quality of software solutions. Moreover, these variables may also be in direct conflict and can only be resolved by the optimum development of software by using reliable software engineering strategies. In this paper, a novel method based on the integration of the mine blast algorithm (MBA) and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is used to create input connection weights and biases for a back propagation neural network (BPNN) for the purpose of addressing the software fault prediction problem (SFP). The aim of hybridizing the MBA and SA is to find a way to efficiently explore and manipulate the search space. The proposed MBA-SA was tested on 18 datasets for SFP. The results indicated that the MBA-SA outperformed the MBA on all datasets. These results were subjected to additional statistical validity, boxplot distribution, and convergence analysis. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation of MBA-SA against twenty state-of-the-art methods for various output metrics was performed, and the result indicated that the hybrid MBA-SA outperformed most other state-of-the-art methods in the majority of datasets.

AB Graph visualization contributes to an efficient understanding of interconnected properties in graph data. However, the exponential growth of interconnections poses great challenges to the efficient visual cognition of graph data. Generation of expressive graph visualization requires investigations of the cognitive process of exploring graph visualization, which can be revealed through the analysis of gaze behaviors. In this paper, we propose GazeGraphVis, a visual analytics system, to analyze gaze behaviors for path tracing tasks. Specifically, GazeGraphVis visualizes gaze behaviors at multiple levels of graph, node and edge with overview + detail techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of human cognitive processes when finishing path tracing tasks. The insights of gaze behaviors for path tracing tasks are revealed using an integrated multiple-view interface. Domain experts in visualization and eye tracking analysis gave high praise to GazeGraphVis for its capability of obtaining the overall search tendencies and deeply analyzing the factors that affect gaze behaviors.

AB Increasing optimizing criteria in modern power systems promotes the birth of many-objective optimal power flow (Ma-OPF) problems in which more than three optimizing objective functions are considered. The increasing optimizing objectives as well as complex constraints of power balance and other system limits bring a decrease in selection pressure and challenges of constraint handling techniques for traditional multi-objective evaluation algorithms. Aiming at the solving difficulties of Ma-OPF problems, an improved NSGA-III integrating eliminating strategy and dynamic constraint relaxation mechanism (NSGA-III-EDR) is proposed. In the proposed approach, a new elimination strategy that eliminates the associated points having the largest angle with the corresponding reference line is employed to increase the selection pressure of the algorithm. An integrated constraint handling method, which employs a repair strategy based on assigning decision variables to feasible values and a penalty function approach together to handle power flow equality constraints, is also introduced into the NSGA-III-EDR. Aiming at lacking feasible solutions of the algorithm in the early searching stage, a strategy of relaxing constraint violations as well as a dynamic updating strategy for the tolerated threshold value of distinguishing feasible and infeasible solutions at the early evolution is proposed. Moreover, an improved domination sorting rule based on the proposed constraint handling method and the relaxing strategy to constraint violations is employed to promote the generation of feasible solutions. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed improved NSGA-III-EDR approach are studied and evaluated on different test cases of a famous standard IEEE 30-bus power system as well as the larger power systems of IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus. The numerical results show that the proposed NSGA-III-EDR method can provide solutions to many-objective OPF problems with tremendous potential compared with the traditional NSGA-III and other algorithms illustrated in the literature.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Solar PV generation is renewable energy source that in the last years has contributed to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Controlling the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) installations is essential in order for its use to spread. Deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated their efficiency in this context. The purpose of this work is to show a methodology to optimised deep learning models and show a specific application of the optimised model to characterise PV installations. The estimations yielded by this model are obtained without the need for real PV data to the training process; synthetic data are used. The built multivariate neural network is optimised through the use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm and the use of a feature engineering tool based on functional data analysis (FDA) clustering. This method was applied on synthetic data and on a PV installation located in north-western Spain, where the number of parallel modules, the azimuth and the slope in the installation are estimated. The results show that the model optimised using the non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the customised dataset with FDA, achieve lower errors or in the same range by reducing the complexity of the model or the complexity of the dataset used. Specifically, the bests models generates estimations with an average error between 6% and 18% on synthetic data and between 6% and 12% on real data.

AB In today's age of big data and information, large-scale group decision-making has become an essential aspect of modern economy, science, and technology. This paper proposes a large-scale group decision-making method that leverages group-oriented rough dominance relation to identify the worst group when addressing complex issues that involve a large number of decision-makers. The proposed method entails building a set -valued ordered information system that utilizes clustering learning to reduce data dimensions and reduce the dimensions of decision space, thereby improving the efficiency of the decision-making process. Additionally, it proposes a novel group-oriented rough dominance relation based on dominance-based rough set theory. By clarifying this advantage relationship, more targeted focus is placed on the group that needs improvement, thereby improving decision-making effectiveness. The proposed method calculates the advantage degree of alternative group plans to select the worst group. The main purpose is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different groups by defining a metric that quantifies the rough dominance relation between groups, thereby improving the objectivity and repeatability of the decision-making process. Finally, the study applies the proposed method to a case study aimed at improving various types of services in European scenic spots, and the benefits of the method are discussed. Experimental analysis shows that the method in this study can screen the groups that should be improved most in this case, showing the benefits and applicability of the proposed method, and providing valuable insights for complex decision-making problems involving multiple decision-makers.

AB Supply chain service platform (SCSP) plays an indispensable role in omni-fulfillment supply chain network services in the digital economy era. In this context, this paper studies the omni-fulfillment supply chain network design considering cost, service, and resilience tradeoffs. The problem is modeled as a multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MOMINLP) model based on omni-fulfillment services. To improve the solving efficiency, the model is linearized, and a tailored multi-objective optimization algorithm is developed. The significant advantage of this algorithm is that the multi-loop skipping mechanism is embedded in the Epsilonconstraint method to obtain the Pareto front faster. The effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework is verified by real-case data. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms AUGMECON2 algorithm in terms of problem size and computational time. In the case of order segmentation, the shorter the delivery time of goods, the higher the cost of the supply chain network. Furthermore, implementing capacity redundancy in the central warehouse can mitigate the impact of different disrupting scenarios.

AB This article is concerned with the projective quasi-synchronization of non-identical complex-valued recurrent neural networks (CVRNNs) with proportional delays and mismatched parameters. The nonlinear Lipschitz activation functions under Lyapunov stability criteria and matrix measure approach have been employed. By designing a suitable controller, a sufficient condition for projective quasi-synchronization criteria of the non-identical CVRNNs model has been derived through the proper description of the matrix measure approach. A significant result for the CVRNNs with mismatched parameters and proportional delays is provided. Finally, a numerical simulation result is given to validate the usefulness and persistence of the theoretical results. The results for different particular cases are displayed graphically.

AB The detection of anomalies in streaming data faces complexities that make traditional static methods unsuitable due to computational costs and nonstationarity. We test and evaluate eight state of the art algorithms against prominent challenges related to streaming data. Results show insights regarding accuracy, memory-dependency, parameterization, and pre-knowledge exploitation, thus revealing the high impact of some data characteristics to establish a most appropriate algorithm, namely: locality (i.e., whether outlierness is relative to local contexts), relativeness (i.e., if past data defines outlierness), and concept drift (if it is expected, its intensity and frequency). In most applied cases, such factors can be inferred in advance through the use of historical data and domain knowledge. Assuming the viability of the studied methods in terms of time efficiency, this work discloses key findings to achieve optimal designs of streaming data anomaly detection in real-life applications.

AB Modern multifloor hybrid (MFH) buildings usually have complex structures and intense closeness, significantly increasing difficulties for the safe evacuation of people in the event of an accidental fire occurrence. Facing the incapacities of traditional evacuation strategies in pointing out the most reasonable evacuation paths in such MFH buildings, it is necessary to study the intelligent evacuation process considering the fire propagation, architectural features, optimal path, and dynamic guidance. To determine the optimal dynamic evacuation strategy after an accidental fire occurrence in MFH buildings, this study proposes a fire propagation-driven dynamic intelligent evacuation (FPDDIE) model. The FPDDIE model includes the optimal path planning method, evacuation time prediction model based on the stacking integration strategy and framework design of active instructions. Among them, the evacuation time prediction model can help people choose safe paths. Finally, a large gymnasium is taken as a real case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method. The results obtained from the numerical analysis and simulations indicate that the overall evacuation time of the crowd is reduced, the prediction error of individual evacuation time is acceptable and the path replanning can ensure evacuation safety in some fire scenarios.

AB Experience replay (ER) is a widely-adopted neuroscience-inspired method to perform lifelong learning. Nonetheless, existing ER-based approaches consider very coarse memory modules with simple memory and rehearsal mechanisms that cannot fully exploit the potential of memory replay. Evidence from neuroscience has provided fine-grained memory and rehearsal mechanisms, such as the dual-store memory system consisting of PFC-HC circuits. However, the computational abstraction of these processes is still very challenging. To address these problems, we introduce the Dual-Memory (DuAL-MEM) model emulating the memorization, consolidation, and rehearsal process in the PFC-HC dual-store memory circuit. DuAL-MEM maintains an incrementally updated short-term memory to benefit current-task learning. At the end of the current task, short-term memories will be consolidated into long-term ones for future rehearsal to alleviate forgetting. For the DuAL-MEM optimization, we propose two learning policies that emulate different memory retrieval strategies: Direct Retrieval Learning and Mixup Retrieval Learning. Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks demonstrate that DuAL-MEM delivers compelling performance while maintaining high learning and memory utilization efficiencies under the challenging experience-once setting.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent developments in various domains have led to a growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance our lives and environments. In particular, the application of artificial intelligence in the management of complex human diseases, such as cancer, has garnered significant attention. The evolution of artificial intelligence is thought to be influenced by multiple factors, including human intervention and environmental factors. Similarly, tumors, being heterogeneous and complex diseases, continue to evolve due to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological environment. Additionally, the concept of cellular intelligence within biological systems has been recognized as a potential attribute of biological entities. Therefore, it is plausible that the tumor intelligence present in cancer cells of affected individuals could undergo super-evolution due to changes in the pro-tumor environment. Thus, a comparative analysis of the evolution of artificial intelligence and super-complex tumor intelligence could yield valuable insights to develop better artificial intelligence-based tools for cancer management.

TI Neural Net-Enhanced Competitive Swarm Optimizer for Large-Scale

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM
AB The competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) classifies swarm particles into loser and winner particles and then uses the winner particles to efficiently guide the search of the loser particles. This approach has very promising performance in solving large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). However, most studies of CSOs ignore the evolution of the winner particles, although their quality is very important for the final optimization performance. Aiming to fill this research gap, this article proposes a new neural net-enhanced CSO for solving LMOPs, called NN-CSO, which not only guides the loser particles via the original CSO strategy, but also applies our trained neural network (NN) model to evolve winner particles. First, the swarm particles are classified into winner and loser particles by the pairwise competition. Then, the loser particles and winner particles are, respectively, treated as the input and desired output to train the NN model, which tries to learn promising evolutionary dynamics by driving the loser particles toward the winners. Finally, when model training is complete, the winner particles are evolved by the well-trained NN model, while the loser particles are still guided by the winner particles to maintain the search pattern of CSOs. To evaluate the performance of our designed NN-CSO, several LMOPs with up to ten objectives and 1000 decision variables are adopted, and the experimental results show that our designed NN model can significantly improve the performance of CSOs and shows some advantages over several state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms as well as over model-based evolutionary algorithms.

AB Landslides refer to occurrences of massive ground movements due to geological (and meteorological) factors, and can have disastrous impacts on property, economy, and even lead to the loss of life. The advances in remote sensing provide accurate and continuous terrain monitoring, enabling the study and analysis of land deformation which, in turn, can be used for land deformation prediction. Prior studies either rely on predefined factors and patterns or model static land observations without considering the subtle interactions between different point locations and the dynamic changes of the surface conditions, causing the prediction model to be less generalized and unable to capture the temporal deformation characteristics. To address these issues, we present DyLand, a dynamic manifold learning framework that models the dynamic structures of the terrain surface. We contribute to the land deformation prediction literature in four directions. First, DyLand learns the spatial connections of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements and estimates the conditional distributions on a dynamic terrain manifold with a novel normalizing flow-based method. Second, instead of modeling the stable terrains, we incorporate surface permutations and capture the innate dynamics of the land surface while allowing for tractable likelihood estimations on the manifold. Third, we formulate the spatiotemporal learning of land deformations as a dynamic system and unify the learning of spatial embeddings and surface deformation. Finally, extensive experiments on curated real-world InSAR datasets (land slopes prone to landslides) show that DyLand outperforms existing benchmark models.

ID FRAMEWORK; AFFINE
AB Nonrigid registration of medical images is formulated usually as an optimization problem with the aim of seeking out the deformation field between a referential-moving image pair. During the past several years, advances have been achieved in the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based registration of images, whose performance was superior to most conventional methods. More lately, the long-range spatial correlations in images have been learned by incorporating an attention-based model into the transformer network. However, medical images often contain plural regions with structures that vary in size. The majority of the CNN-and transformer-based approaches adopt embedding of patches that are identical in size, disallowing representation of the inter-regional structural disparities within an image. Besides, it probably leads to the structural and semantical inconsistencies of objects as well. To address this issue, we put forward an innovative module called region-based structural relevance embedding (RSRE), which allows adaptive embedding of an image into unequally-sized structural regions based on the similarity of self-constructing latent graph instead of utilizing patches that are identical in size. Additionally, a transformer is integrated with the proposed module to serve as an adaptive region-based transformer (ART) for registering medical images nonrigidly. As demonstrated by the experimental outcomes, our ART is superior to the advanced nonrigid registration approaches in performance, whose Dice score is 0.734 on the LPBA40 dataset with 0.318% foldings for deformation field, and is 0.873 on the ADNI dataset with 0.331% foldings.

TI Emotion-Semantic-Aware Dual Contrastive Learning for Epistemic Emotion
   Identification of Learner-Generated Reviews in MOOCs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

DE Dual contrastive learning (DualCL); emotional-semantic features;
   epistemic emotion identification; massive open online courses (MOOCs)
AB Identifying the epistemic emotions of learner-generated reviews in massive open online courses (MOOCs) can help instructors provide adaptive guidance and interventions for learners. The epistemic emotion identification task is a fine-grained identification task that contains multiple categories of emotions arising during the learning process. Previous studies only consider emotional or semantic information within the review texts alone, which leads to insufficient feature representation. In addition, some categories of epistemic emotions are ambiguously distributed in feature space, making them hard to be distinguished. In this article, we present an emotion-semantic-aware dual contrastive learning (ES-DCL) approach to tackle these issues. In order to learn sufficient feature representation, implicit semantic features and human-interpretable emotional features are, respectively, extracted from two different views to form complementary emotional-semantic features. On this basis, by leveraging the experience of domain experts and the input emotional-semantic features, two types of contrastive losses (label contrastive loss and feature contrastive loss) are formulated. They are designed to train the discriminative distribution of emotional-semantic features in the sample space and to solve the anisotropy problem between different categories of epistemic emotions. The proposed ES-DCL is compared with 11 other baseline models on four different disciplinary MOOCs review datasets. Extensive experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of epistemic emotion identification, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods in learning more discriminative sentence representations.

TI XTQA: Span-Level Explanations for Textbook Question Answering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Explanation extracting (EE); question answering
AB Textbook question answering (TQA) is the task of correctly answering diagram or nondiagram (ND) questions given large multimodal contexts consisting of abundant essays and diagrams. In real-world scenarios, an explainable TQA system plays a key role in deepening humans' understanding of learned knowledge. However, there is no work to investigate how to provide explanations currently. To address this issue, we devise a novel architecture toward span-level eXplanations for TQA (XTQA). In this article, spans are the combinations of sentences within a paragraph. The key idea is to consider the entire textual context of a lesson as candidate evidence and then use our proposed coarse-to-fine grained explanation extracting (EE) algorithm to narrow down the evidence scope and extract the span-level explanations with varying lengths for answering different questions. The EE algorithm can also be integrated into other TQA methods to make them explainable and improve the TQA performance. Experimental results show that XTQA obtains the best overall explanation result mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 52.38% on the first 300 questions of CK12-QA test splits, demonstrating the explainability of our method (ND: 150 and diagram: 150). The results also show that XTQA achieves the best TQA performance of 36.46% and 36.95% on the aforementioned splits. We have released our code in https://github.com/dr-majie/opentqa.

ID BAYESIAN-INFERENCE
AB Standard Bayesian learning is known to have suboptimal generalization capabilities under misspecification and in the presence of outliers. Probably approximately correct (PAC)-Bayes theory demonstrates that the free energy criterion minimized by Bayesian learning is a bound on the generalization error for Gibbs predictors (i.e., for single models drawn at random from the posterior) under the assumption of sampling distributions uncontaminated by outliers. This viewpoint provides a justification for the limitations of Bayesian learning when the model is misspecified, requiring ensembling, and when data are affected by outliers. In recent work, PAC-Bayes bounds-referred to as PAC(m)-were derived to introduce free energy metrics that account for the performance of ensemble predictors, obtaining enhanced performance under misspecification. This work presents a novel robust free energy criterion that combines the generalized logarithm score function with PAC(m) ensemble bounds. The proposed free energy training criterion produces predictive distributions that are able to concurrently counteract the detrimental effects of misspecification-with respect to both likelihood and prior distribution-and outliers.

AB Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is one of the most challenging tasks and active fields in natural language processing (NLP). MRC systems aim to enable a machine to understand a given context in natural language and to answer a series of questions about it. With the advent of bi-directional deep learning algorithms and large-scale datasets, MRC achieved improved results. However, these models are still suffering from two research issues: textual ambiguities and semantic vagueness to comprehend the long passages and generate answers for abstractive MRC systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Extended Generative Pretrained Transformers-based Question Answering (ExtGPT-QA) model to generate precise and relevant answers to questions about a given context. The proposed architecture comprises two modified forms of encoder and decoder as compared to GPT. The encoder uses a positional encoder to assign a unique representation with each word in the sentence for reference to address the textual ambiguities. Subsequently, the decoder module involves a multihead attention mechanism along with affine and aggregation layers to mitigate semantic vagueness with MRC systems. Additionally, we applied syntax and semantic feature engineering techniques to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed model. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, a comprehensive empirical analysis is carried out using three benchmark datasets including SQuAD, Wiki-QA, and News-QA. The results of the proposed ExtGPT-QA outperformed state of art MRC techniques and obtained 93.25% and 90.52% F1-score and exact match, respectively. The results confirm the effectiveness of the ExtGPT-QA model to address textual ambiguities and semantic vagueness issues in MRC systems.

AB Server logs are always essential in website maintenance. The services maintained may encounter various problems, and the logs generated by the server are the core data for locating the problem. However, existing log storage systems are susceptible to single points of failure, which can lead to potential log leakage. Meanwhile, external adversaries can tamper with logs to avoid tracking, and administrators can also tamper with logs to evade responsibility. In order to solve these tough shortcomings effectively, introducing blockchain networks seems to be an appropriate solution due to their immutability and decentralized nature. Traditional blockchains lack scalability in storing large files, but this can be tackled by storing log data in the interplanetary file system (IPFS). In this paper, we propose a log data storage scheme combined with blockchain networks and the IPFS technique. First, we utilize the IPFS to store extensive file log data and combine blockchain systems to realize decentralized log data storage in a secure manner. Second, to optimize the query efficiency of log data, we propose two improved Merkle tree methods, providing rapid queries of log data with a timestamp as query keywords (only one-third of the BBT in range query time). Finally, our comprehensive experimental results show that the two proposed methods have better log retrieval efficiency.

AB With the advent of pervasive, dependable, and near-instant wireless connectivity for humans and machines, Blockchain technology is serving as the backbone of digital revolution of this era. For ensuring successful and secured communication in Blockchain databases, an accurate extraction of abnormal communication features is imperative and innovative mechanisms are required to achieve the seamless communication for Blockchain-enabled transactions. In order to achieve this objective, a novel feature extraction method for anomalous communication is proposed in this article for secured Blockchain-enabled transactions. In the proposed technique, wavelet transformation is employed to deconstruct the aberrant network communication signals in high and low frequency bands to detect the anomaly. The corresponding parameters for phase space reconstruction and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are devised based on the distribution features of the data in the frequency range. Using the KPCA approach (which combines principal component analysis and kernel learning), the wavelet packet decomposition coefficients are recreated after noise reduction to achieve nonlinear noise of abnormal signals as well as abnormal data. The high-dimensional feature space is mapped to the de-noised abnormal communication to protect the data in Blockchain-based transactions. The principal component is analyzed according to the nonlinear function in the mapped feature space, and the nonlinear function is resolved by using the self-organizing neural network. The results reveal that the proposed strategy works with 92 percent accuracy and have practical implication in real-time Blockchain-based transaction to find the anomalies in the data for safeguarding the Blockchain-based transactions.

AB This study proposes a trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method to evaluate agricultural risk management tools. The weighted centroids based on AHP is used in the proposed method to defuzzify the fuzzy weighted ratings of each alternative versus each criterion. By this way, this method considers all centroid values of the upper and lower membership functions and uses the weight as a parameter to consider the relative importance of controid values of the upper and lower membership functions. Additionally, the left and the right upper membership function and lower membership function of the multiplication of two positive trapezoidal IT2FNs can be developed based on the & alpha;-cuts. The proposed method is applied to help farmers compare agricultural risk management tools and select the most suitable one. This is the first study using fuzzy decision-making methods to help farmers evaluate agricultural risk management tools. To show the proposed method's feasibility, a numerical example is displayed. Finally, some comparisons are made to show the advantages of the proposed method, and an experiment is conducted to show the robustness of the proposed method.

ID INTERVAL TYPE-2; MODEL; SETS
AB Computing with words is a soft computing technique in which computational objects are natural words and propositions are taken from some natural language. It offers a significant ability of computing human knowledge/information present in natural language. The main idea of computing with words is based on the remarkable ability of human beings to deal with several types of real-world decision-making problems without any measurements or computations. One of the most significant and fundamental fuzzy optimisation problems that appear as a sub-problem in several real-world applications is the fuzzy environment-oriented transportation problem, sometimes known as the fuzzy transportation problem. In fuzzy transportation problems, we use type-1 fuzzy set or fuzzy numbers to represent the transportation cost, supply or demand. However, humans describe these variables in their daily life using terms like large, medium, small, some, etc., which do not supply any real or fuzzy number. In this article, the motivation is to find an algorithm for transportation problems that is simple enough and effective in real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose an algorithm to solve the transportation problem based on computing with words, where some realistic words (e.g. large, medium, small, or tiny) are considered for representing transportation cost, supply, and demand. The efficiency of our suggested approach is demonstrated with a few numerical examples.

AB Local governments are willing to use their activities and resources in accordance with the changing and transforming conditions. Especially with the increasing importance of sustainability, economic, social, and environmental strategies are redefining. Thus, a sustainable corporate governance model that includes a systematic and analytical approach should be used to solve the decision-making problem of local governments regarding changing corporate and environmental sustainability strategies. In particular, new measurement methods are required to define the sustainability outputs/strategies of local governments. In this context, it is clear that there is a need for a more holistic approach that focuses not only on the immediate effects at the local government level but also on the positive effects on the entire system. While the study fills this gap, it also evaluates the long-term and sustainable impacts of the organization. The study also contributes to a methodological framework that can help advance future research on the practice of monitoring sustainable development by local governments. This study aims to determine the best corporate sustainability strategy by evaluating environmental sustainability from the perspective of local governments. For this purpose, the criteria were evaluated using trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy SWARA, and the alternatives were ranked through trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy COPRAS methods. The findings show that net-zero targets and sustainable production are more crucial criteria. Additionally, it has been determined that social and environmental strategies have priority in the selection of alternative criteria related to corporate sustainability. The main finding of this study is that local governments include responsible production criteria in their priority policies. The results obtained contribute to the literature on measuring sustainable development outcomes in local government organizations and identify strategies and improvement opportunities that can lead to better practices.

AB This article combines a Gaussian mixture model with SUSAN edge recognition operator to detect moving targets. This method extracts foreground targets through Gaussian composite model background subtraction and extracts the approximate contour of moving targets through morphological processing such as corrosion and dilation. At the same time, this frame image is processed through SUSAN edge detection. In practical applications, there is an urgent need for a flexible and efficient processing method and means to construct a traffic statistical feature dataset that meets one's own needs. The IoT data preprocessing method based on data devices proposed in this article can effectively extract traffic statistical features. Compared with existing technologies, it has faster extraction speed, higher degree of automation, and strong universality. Using this method can flexibly construct traffic statistical features in different classification demand scenarios, greatly improving the preprocessing efficiency of original network flow data. The experimental results show that when the camera is stationary, the method used in this paper and the traditional basketball motion object detection method based on Gaussian mixture model can not only effectively detect moving objects, but also overcome the effects of shadows, light, and noise. In the case of camera motion, it can effectively improve the accuracy of camera motion component estimation and accurately detect basketball motion images. This article applies the Gaussian mixture model and SUSAN edge recognition operator to the detection of moving objects in basketball motion images, promoting the vigorous development of basketball.

AB The process of establishing contact with a computer through gestures still faces many bottlenecks that need to be solved, one of which is how to accurately recognize dynamic gestures. The traditional 3D convolution operation is transformed into a separable convolution operation based on separable convolution. The larger convolution kernel is transformed into smaller convolution and point convolution operations in the depth direction of the input data. The purpose of extracting and modeling the features of the input data is achieved, as well as the purpose of reducing the amount of calculation for the 3D convolution operation. Therefore, a long and short time memory network (which is more sensitive to temporal features) is introduced in the underlying network structure to memorize and model the relevant temporal information. Additionally, in order to overcome the adverse effects of the external background environment, an attention mechanism is also introduced into the structure to achieve suppression of the irrelevant background. On the basis of the existing research, by fusing the information of different modalities, the designed related experiments verify that the fusion operation is better than the recognition effect of single-modal information in dynamic gesture tasks. The experimental results show that three network structures, the efficient extraction of dynamic gesture features, and better recognition performance on the validation set of the IsoGD dataset can all be achieved. We propose a new method for dynamic gesture recognition, and the proposed model effectively improves the accuracy of gesture recognition.

AB With the surge of searching and reading online health-based articles, maintaining the quality and credibility of online health-based articles has become crucial. The circulation of deceptive health information on numerous social media sites can mislead people and can potentially cause adverse effects on people's health. To address these problems, this work uses deep learning approaches to automate the assessment and scoring of online health-related articles' credibility. The paper proposed an Attention-based Recurrent Multichannel Convolutional Neural Network (ARMCNN) model. The proposed model incorporates a BiLSTM layer, a multichannel CNN layer, and an attention layer and predicts the credibility of online health information. To perform a reliable evaluation of the presented model, we utilize the health articles reviewed by the experts, compiled in a labeled dataset termed "Pubhealth," which consists of thousands of health articles. The results are evaluated using five performance measures, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Furthermore, we extensively compared the proposed model with different deep learning and machine learning models such as Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, CNN (Convolutional neural network), and RNN-CNN. The experimental results showed that the proposed model produced state-of-the-art performance on the used dataset by achieving an accuracy of 0.88, precision of 0.92, recall of 0.87, f1-score of 0.90, and AUC of 0.94. Further, the proposed model yielded better performance than other benchmarked techniques for the credibility assessment of online health articles.

AB The COVID-19 outbreak, which has a devastating impact on the health and well-being of the global population, is a respiratory disease. It is vital to determine, isolate and treat people with the disease as soon as possible to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, the accuracy of which is about 63%, seems to be a good option for determining COVID-19, it is a disadvantage is that test kits are few, are difficult to obtain in remote rural areas and have low accuracy. Chest X-ray (CXR) has become essential for rapidly diagnosing the rapidly spreading COVID-19 disease worldwide, so it is urgent to develop an online system that will help specialists identify infected patients with CXR images. In this study developed a transfer learning-based diagnosis system for online diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using CXR images. Transfer learning-based deep learning models VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet121 and DenseNet201 were used for the experimental studies. We explored the COVID-19 radiography database from Kaggle, which is open to the public, using image preprocessing techniques and data augmentation. The images captured by the various terminals are transferred to the web server in the created system. Similar to the ensemble learning approach, the percentage accuracy of the model with the highest prediction value among the eight deep learning models is displayed on the screen. The results show that the proposed online diagnosis system performs better than others with the highest accuracy, precision, recall and F1 values of 98%, 99%, 97% and 97%, respectively. The results show that deep learning models help to increase the efficiency of chest radiograph scanning and have promising potential in predicting COVID-19 cases. The online diagnostic system will be a helpful tool for radiologists as it diagnoses COVID-19 quickly and with high accuracy.

AB Face photo-sketch recognition plays an important role in law enforcement, particularly in narrowing down the search for potential suspects based on limited sketch information. However, the issues of large modality gap and having a relatively small number of sketch samples for training remained a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel feature descriptor network for automated face photo-sketch recognition that is suitable for modality discrepancy and small dataset learning. By stacking a multi-directional image difference operation over a pooling projection in a multilayer fashion, our proposal forms an interpretable learning system that does not show obvious overfitting on limited training data. Extensive evaluation using three public face photo-sketch databases shows competing rank-1 recognition accuracy of the proposed method comparing with state-of-the-art methods. In terms of average ranking on the three experimented databases, the proposed method has the top average rank of 2 among 17 algorithms with the runner-up LFDA algorithm having an average rank of 2.83.

AB In an industrial control system, a programmable logic controller (PLC) plays a vital role in maintaining the stable operation of the system. Cyber-attacks can affect the regular operation by tampering with the data stored in the PLC, thereby damaging to the system. Thus, it is particularly important to develop an efficient cyber-attacks recovery method. However, owing to the impact of unknown factors in theoretical methods, poor scalability of automaton theory, and a lack of constraints during the training process of deep learning network models, the restoration accuracy and stability are low. Therefore, it is a significant challenge to design an appropriate method to improve the accuracy and stability of cyber-attacks recovery. In this study, the generative adversarial networks were applied to the problem of cyber-attacks recovery; furthermore, a multi-stage generative adversarial networks was designed. The model consisted of a Variational Autoencoder and two conditional energy-based generative adversarial networks (CEBGANs). Then the second CEBGAN uses the fitted random noise appending with the data generated by the previous stage and the historical data as additional information to obtain the restoration results. Moreover, a self-adaptive decision policy was established to enhance the restoration accuracy and stability. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method in this manuscript could effectively improve the accuracy of cyber-attacks data recovery and reduce the possibility of outliers in data recovery.

AB Deep neural network has achieved promising results for automatic glaucoma detection on fundus images. Nevertheless, the intrinsic discrepancy across glaucoma datasets is challenging for the data-driven neural network approaches. This discrepancy leads to the domain gap that affects model performance and declines model generalization capability. Existing domain adaptation-based transfer learning methods mostly fine-tune pretrained models on target domains to reduce the domain gap. However, this feature learning-based adaptation method is implicit, and it is not an optimal solution for transfer learning on the diverse glaucoma datasets. In this paper, we propose a mixup domain adaptation (mixDA) method that bridges domain adaptation with domain mixup to improve model performance across divergent glaucoma datasets. Specifically, the domain adaptation reduces the domain gap of glaucoma datasets in transfer learning with an explicit adaptation manner. Meanwhile, the domain mixup further minimizes the risk of outliers after domain adaptation and improves the model generalization capability. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our mixDA on several public glaucoma datasets. Moreover, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four glaucoma datasets: REFUGE, LAG, ORIGA, and RIM-ONE.

DE Technologies for personnel selection; Fairness auditing; Recruitment;
   Discrimination; AI Act; Data trust
AB The use of technologies in personnel selection has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, revealing their potential to amplify existing inequalities in recruitment processes. To date, however, there has been a lack of comprehensive assessments of respective discriminatory potentials and no legal or practical standards have been explicitly established for fairness auditing. The current proposal of the Artificial Intelligence Act classifies numerous applications in personnel selection and recruitment as high-risk technologies, and while it requires quality standards to protect the fundamental rights of those involved, particularly during development, it does not provide concrete guidance on how to ensure this, especially once the technologies are commercially available. We argue that comprehensive and reliable auditing of personnel selection technologies must be contextual, that is, embedded in existing processes and based on real data, as well as participative, involving various stakeholders beyond technology vendors and customers, such as advocacy organizations and researchers. We propose an architectural draft that employs a data trustee to provide independent, fiduciary management of personal and corporate data to audit the fairness of technologies used in personnel selection. Drawing on a case study conducted with two state-owned companies in Berlin, Germany, we discuss challenges and approaches related to suitable fairness metrics, operationalization of vague concepts such as migration* and applicable legal foundations that can be utilized to overcome the fairness-privacy-dilemma arising from uncertainties associated with current laws. We highlight issues that require further interdisciplinary research to enable a prototypical implementation of the auditing concept in the mid-term.

AB Finding valid correspondences is of considerable significance to image matching, which has been regarded as the key of numerous vision-based tasks. Current methods usually have drawbacks in sets with high proportion of outliers. To address the problem, given a set of putative correspondences in two images, this paper proposes a novel framework (named SAH-Net) to remove outliers and recover camera pose through essential matrix using an end-to-end network. The proposed SAH-Net is hierarchical with a multi-scale structure, which consists of correspondence level and cluster level. First, correspondence level takes advantage of two-view geometry to learn correspondence features. Next, in order to integrate structural information of the scene, correspondences are pooled via a self-attention method. Additionally, SAH-Net applies a spatial correlation operation after the clustering, separating features into segments and learning the spatial characteristics of clustered nodes. Finally, clusters have been integrated with spatial information, and they are recovered to original scale via a learned upsampling operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on remote sensing image registration, general image matching (outdoor and indoor image datasets respectively) and loop closure detection, which demonstrate the excellence of SAH-Net in mismatch removal and relative pose estimation compared to other state-of-the-art competitors.

AB As an auxiliary loss function, the mutual information constraint is widely used in various deep learning tasks, such as deep reinforcement learning and representation learning. However, the degree of mutual information constraint is not concerned in many tasks. This paper discusses a situation in which mutual information must be constrained within an appropriate range. In this situation, it is challenging to calculate mutual information accurately. There is still an error between the obtained and ideal features when using mutual information constraints. Therefore, how to reduce this error is a problem worthy of study. This paper proposes a new method to utilize mutual information constraints to more precisely constrain features. This method, called the Adversarial Training-based Mutual Information Constraint (ATMIC) method, can be constructed using different mutual information estimation methods and widely applied in various tasks. ATMIC extracts noise from the obtained feature to attack the original mutual information constraint. The noise can force the encoder to reduce the error between the obtained and ideal features. Experiments show that our ATMIC method achieves better results than other mutual information constraint methods in permutation-invariant MNIST, fair learning, multimodal sentiment analysis, and GLUE tasks.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL
AB This paper proposes an adaptive fractional-order sliding mode controller to control and stabilize a nonlinear uncertain disturbed robotic manipulator in fixed-time. Fractional calculus is used to construct a fractional-order sliding mode controller (FtNTSM) that suppresses chattering to help the robotic manipulator converge to equilibrium in a fixed-settling time based on fixed-time stability theory. Then, adaptive control is introduced and combined with FtNTSM to overcome the unknown system dynamics. The convergence time of the proposed fixed-time fractional-order sliding mode controller (AFtNTSM) is independent of beginning circumstances and can be precisely assessed, unlike the finite-time control approach. Finally, numerical simulations show that the adaptive fractional-order sliding mode controller outperforms finite-time sliding mode controller.

ID VESSEL SEGMENTATION; PARTICLE SWARM; NETWORKS
AB Designing reasonable architectures of convolutional neural network (CNN) for specific image segmentation remains a challenging task, as the determination of the structure and hyperparameters of CNN depends heavily on expertise and requires a great deal of time. Evolutionary algorithm (EA) has been successfully applied to the automatic design of CNNs; however, the inherent stochastic search of EA tends to cause "experience loss" and requires very large computational resources. To deal with this problem, a maximal sparse convex surrogate model with updated empirical information is proposed in this paper to guide the evolutionary process of CNN design. This sparse convex function is transformed from a non-convex function to a maximized sparse convex function, which can better utilize the prior empirical knowledge to assist the evolutionary search. In addition, a balance strategy between computational resources and accuracy is proposed in the selection of reasonable network architectures. The proposed fully automatic design method of CNN is applied to the segmentation of steel microstructure images, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with the existing state-of-the-art methods.

ID DESIGN
AB Mobile cable-driven parallel robots (MCDPRs) offer expanded motion capabilities and workspace compared to traditional cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) by incorporating mobile bases. However, additional mobile bases introduce more degree-of-freedom (DoF) and various constraints to make their motion planning a challenging problem. Despite several motion planning methods for MCDPRs being developed in the literature, they are only applicable to known environments, and autonomous navigation in unknown environments with obstacles remains a challenging issue. The ability to navigate autonomously is essential for MCDPRs, as it opens up possibilities for the robot to perform a broad range of tasks in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, this study proposes an online motion planning method for MCDPRs based on the pipeline of rapidly exploring random tree (RRT). The presented approach explores unknown environments efficiently to produce high-quality collision-free trajectories for MCDPRs. To ensure the optimal execution of the planned trajectories, the study introduces two indicators specifically designed for the mobile bases and the end-effector. These indicators take into account various performance metrics, including trajectory quality and kinematic performance, enabling the determination of the final following trajectory that best aligns with the desired objectives of the robot. Moreover, to effectively handle unknown environments, a vision-based system utilizing an RGB-D camera is developed, allowing for precise MCDPR localization and obstacle detection, ultimately enhancing the autonomy and adaptability of the MCDPR. Finally, the extensive simulations conducted using dynamic simulation software (CoppeliaSim) and the on-board real-world experiments with a self-built MCDPR prototype demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE Deep learning; Deepfakes; Face recognition; Face forgery detection;
   Domain invariant representations
AB With the rapid development of deep learning, face forgery detection methods have also achieved remarkable progress. However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation on low-quality compressed face images. It is due to: (a) The image artifacts will be blurred in the process of image compression, resulting in the model learning insufficient artifact traces; (b) Low-quality images will introduce a lot of noise information, and minimizing the training error causes the model to absorb all correlations in the training dataset recklessly, leading to the over-fitting problem. To solve the above problems, we consider learning domain invariant representations to inscribe the correct relevance, i.e., artifacts, to improve the robustness of low-quality images. Specifically, we propose a novel face forgery detector, called DIFLD. The model has the following components: (1) a high-frequency invariant feature learning module(hf-IFLM), which effectively retrieves the blurred artifacts in low-quality compressed images; and (2) a high-dimensional feature distribution learning module(hd-FDLM), that guides the network to learn more about the consistent features of distribution. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discriminative correct artifact features in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method is more robust to image quality variations, especially in low-quality images. Our proposed method achieves a 3.67% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging dataset NeuralTextures.

AB The appearance of complex attention-based language models such as BERT, RoBERTa or GPT-3 has allowed to address highly complex tasks in a plethora of scenarios. However, when applied to specific domains, these models encounter considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter, an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex language, where each message requires careful evaluation to be understood even by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this scenario, language specific nuances get lost in translation. To face these challenges we present BERTuit, the largest transformer proposed so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230 M Spanish tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown with applications, in this case: an unsupervised methodology to visualize groups of hoaxes; and supervised profiling of authors spreading disinformation.

AB Environmental information disclosure, an essential way of making business information transparent, can enable enterprises to reduce their financing costs and improve financing efficiency in the green financing market. This study used a green information disclosure quality evaluation system comprising 24 indicators, followed by the entropy weight method, grey relation analysis method and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to provide a comprehensive green information disclosure quality evaluation method for enterprises in the green financing market. Subsequently, we empirically analyzed Chinese listed companies. The results revealed that indicators, such as pollutant emissions, environmental protection concepts, and environmental protection goals, are important factors in the evaluation of green information quality. The overall quality of green information disclosed by the sample companies was poor and varied significantly. For heavily polluting enterprises, the evaluation results obtained via the proposed method matched perfectly with the corporate environmental rating results published by the Chinese environmental social governance rating agency, China ChengXin Green Finance. Moreover, compared with the traditional method, the integrated method could reflect the overall evaluation differences such that the green information disclosure quality of green enterprises could be evaluated more reasonably and effectively. This provides relevant directions for institutional developers and incentives for companies to disclose environmental information.

AB In reality, data is always arranged at multiple granularity levels. Multi-scale information tables were introduced from the viewpoint of granular computing to represent such types of data sets. In the present paper, we focus on acquisition of if-then rules in incomplete multi-scale decision tables (IMSDT for short). The notion of generalization reducts is proposed to achieve the desired goal. By firstly considering the generalization reducts of an IMSDT and then calculating the generalization reducts for each object, a collection of optimal decision rules can be thus obtained. During the entire process of generalization reducts, both the number and the generalization ability of the original attribute set are taken into consideration. It is shown that a more general and simple set of decision rules can be obtained by using generalization reducts, compared with the approaches in the literature. Lastly, an explanatory example is employed to show the advantage of our approach, and an experiment is designed for performing a comparative study between different approaches.

ID CONTACTLESS; NETWORK
AB Improving interoperability in contactless-to-contact fingerprint matching is a crucial factor for the mainstream adoption of contactless fingerphoto devices. However, matching contactless probe images against legacy contact-based gallery images is very challenging due to the presence of heterogeneity between these domains. Moreover, unconstrained acquisition of fingerphotos produces perspective distortion. Therefore, direct matching of fingerprint features suffers severe performance degradation on cross-domain interoperability. In this study, to address this issue, the authors propose a coupled adversarial learning framework to learn a fingerprint representation in a low-dimensional subspace that is discriminative and domain-invariant in nature. In fact, using a conditional coupled generative adversarial network, the authors project both the contactless and the contact-based fingerprint into a latent subspace to explore the hidden relationship between them using class-specific contrastive loss and ArcFace loss. The ArcFace loss ensures intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, whereas the contrastive loss minimises the distance between the subspaces for the same finger. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the methods and two top-performing commercial-off-the-shelf SDKs, that is, Verifinger v12.0 and Innovatrics. In addition, the authors also introduce a multi-finger score fusion network that significantly boosts interoperability by effectively utilising the multi-finger input of the same subject for both cross-domain and cross-sensor settings.

AB Reducing material waste and computation time are primary objectives in cutting and packing problems (C & P). A solution to the C & P problem consists of many steps, including the grouping of items to be nested and the arrangement of the grouped items on a large object. Current algorithms use meta-heuristics to solve the arrangement problem directly without explicitly addressing the grouping problem. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline for the nesting problem that starts with grouping the items to be nested and then arranging them on large objects. To this end, we introduce and motivate a new concept, namely the Geometrical Compatibility Index (GCI). Items with higher GCI should be clustered together. Since no labels exist for GCIs, we propose to model GCIs as bidirectional weighted edges of a graph that we call geometrical relationship graph (GRG). We propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based framework, which consists of two graph neural networks trained in an actor-critic-like fashion to learn GCIs. Then, to group the items into clusters, we model the GRG as a capacitated vehicle routing problem graph and solve it using meta-heuristics. Experiments conducted on a private dataset with regularly and irregularly shaped items show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in computation time (30% to 48%) compared to an open-source nesting software while attaining similar trim loss on regular items and a threefold improvement in trim loss on irregular items.

DE Hierarchical classification; Incremental learning; Neural collapse
AB Incremental learning models need to update the categories and their conceptual understanding over time. The current research has placed more emphasis on learning new categories, while another common but under-explored incremental scenario is the updating and refinement of category labels. In this paper, we present the Hierarchical Task-Incremental Learning (HTIL) problem, which emulates the human cognitive process of progressing from coarse to fine. While the model learns the fine categories, it gains a better understanding of the perception of coarse categories, thereby enhancing its ability to differentiate between previously encountered classes. Inspired by neural collapse, we propose to initialize the coarse class prototypes and update the new fine class using hierarchical relations. We conduct experiments on diverse hierarchical data benchmarks, and the experiment results show our method achieves excellent results.

ID DENSE NETWORK
AB High-performance convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stack many convolutional layers to obtain powerful feature extraction capability, which leads to huge storing and computational costs. The authors focus on lightweight models for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, so a novel lightweight criss-cross large kernel convolutional neural network (LiteCCLKNet) is proposed. Specifically, a lightweight module containing two 1D convolutions with self-attention mechanisms in orthogonal directions is presented. By setting large kernels within the 1D convolutional layers, the proposed module can efficiently aggregate long-range contextual features. In addition, the authors effectively obtain a global receptive field by stacking only two of the proposed modules. Compared with traditional lightweight CNNs, LiteCCLKNet reduces the number of parameters for easy deployment to resource-limited platforms. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed LiteCCLKNet outperforms the previous lightweight CNNs and has higher storage efficiency.

ID OUTLIER DETECTION; GRAPH
AB Rumor detection has been a hot issue in current online public opinion governance. Most of the recent rumor detection methods tend to be supervised learning, while research about unsupervised detection methods is relatively rare, which focuses on deep learning models. For both interpretability and high performance, an unsupervised rumor detection method based on neighborhood information transmission (NIT) is proposed. Firstly, the initial importance regarded as the initial information of the object is evaluated from the perspective of local and global heterogeneous distance. Then the neighborhood information graph is constructed based on the neighborhood relationship on mixed data. On the neighborhood graph, NIT performs information transmission between neighbors and constantly updates the importance score by paying attention to the correlation between objects. Finally, the rumor object can be sought out by importance score ranking. In addition, to enhance the rumor identification effect, a propagation-based enhancement strategy is proposed to improve the performance of the unsupervised rumor detection algorithm by the propagation index of each object. Experiments were conducted on two UCI datasets and Weibo real-world rumor dataset, and the results proved the effectiveness of the NIT algorithm and the feasibility of the enhancement strategy.

AB The pressing issue of climate change has led to a growing concern for low-carbon energy transformation. Urban energy internet (UEI) provides a means to facilitate renewable energy consumption by leveraging modern energy grid, smart energy services, and cyber-physical systems. However, the implementation of UEI entails complex and unknown risks arising from energy supplies, cyber-attacks, and defective equipment. To address this challenge, we propose an improved decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory based on knowledge graph and complex network (KG-CN-DEMATEL). Specifically, we employ a knowledge graph with Gaussian embedding (KG2E) to vectorize text information related to the risks. The vectors are combined with experts' scores, which evaluate the importance and cohesion of the complex network. We then analyze the significance and interrelations of the risks by computing their reason and central degree. Our results demonstrate that (1) the improved model offers higher accuracy and convenience than the conventional DEMATEL, (2) the 15 risks are ranked based on their importance, with R1 (Renewable energy's uncertainty), R6 (Generation technology), and R2 (Cyber-physical degree) being the most significant, with central degrees of 2.913, 2.635, and 2.566, respectively, and (3) the risks can be classified into six causal and nine effect elements, with their interrelations analyzed.

AB Microblogging services, such as Twitter and Sina Weibo, are popular media for information dissemination in cyberspace. Predicting this information dissemination (i.e., users' retweet behavior) is essential in various applications, such as applications for content recommendations and public opinion analyses. Most state-of-the-art models use deep representation methods to learn about the features of the input variables (e.g., social relationships and retweet history) and obtain predictions based on the association between the features and retweet behavior. However, these models ignore the inherent confounding association, which can cause models to learn spurious relationships in the data, thereby decreasing their generalizability. To solve this problem, this paper devises a novel causal-enriched deep attention (CEDA) framework for (1) evaluating the causal effects of input variables on retweet behaviors by blocking the confounding association and (2) assigning appropriate attention weights to different variables with causal effects when training models and obtaining predictions. Specifically, the CEDA uses a hidden variable to represent factors that are difficult to observe but can influence user behavior. This ensures that the model can more realistically portray a given microblogging service. Moreover, the score function of the CEDA can overcome the over-suppression problem that may arise from the causal inference. It avoids the loss of predictive information due to the elimination of the confounding association. The results of testing the CEDA on several public datasets indicate that the CEDA improves the performance (F1-score) of a retweet prediction model by an average of 3.73%.

DE Multimodal; Object detection; Document layout analysis; Deep learning
AB In document layout analysis, both computer vision based and natural language processing based methods are employed individually or integrated to enrich the feature information resources and to enforce object detection. To simultaneously leverage visual and textual modalities, this paper proposes a hierarchical multimodal (HiM) network to aggregate representative features from multi-source inputs with the introduction of complementary semantics and non-local context dependencies across grained scales. Different channel and spatial attention mechanisms are adapted to different modalities. The visual modality is based on conventional convolution network, while the textual modality focuses on embedding hierarchical textual vectors and positioning. The feature representations from multiple modalities are then integrated adaptively in feature pyramid network for subsequent region proposal processing. We have made database adaptation on PubLayNet, including inserting semi-structure elements and extending ground truth annotations by parsing PDF pages. On three popular benchmarks, including Article Regions, PubLayNet and DocBank, extensive experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of HiM.

DE Multi-label ship recognition; Complex background; Joint learning;
   Circular attention mechanism
AB Multi-label ship recognition is a more challenging task than single-label ship recognition, mainly due to the complexity of the ship target location space. Environmental factors, such as inclement weather and uneven illumination, can negatively affect the acquisition of detailed features of each ship target. Unfortunately, existing multi-label ship recognition methods tend to focus more on high-level semantic features, neglecting the importance of low-level contour texture details in the target area. These methods also overlook the correlation between high-level semantic features and low-level contour texture details, resulting in insufficient information in the feature embedding space of the target area. To tackle these problems, we propose joint learning networks of low-level and high-level features for multi-label ship recognition in complex backgrounds(LHJL). Our proposed method consists of a circular attention guided(CAG) CNN module, which enriches the high-level semantic features of target regions and reduces the impact of complex environmental information. We also use low-level features after high-level deconvolution(AHDF) to output important contour texture details of the target area by weighting the key pixel values of the local detail features. Finally, joint learning of high-level features outputted by circular attention guides the CNN, and low-level features yielded by covariance pooling reduce the impact of complex environments, which can improve the mapping ability of detailed features of each ship target in complex spatial positions and complete multi-label ship recognition in complex backgrounds. We conducted experiments on public datasets such as Seaships and SMD and collected images of complex natural environments containing 59 ship categories. The results show that our proposed LHJL method outperforms other existing methods.

In multivariate time series data, one feature is chosen as the target feature and the other is seen as auxiliary information. These features have very complex spatial dependencies, and most of the existing models put all features together for spatial feature extraction, which is an undifferentiated feature extraction process. It can not distinguish the importance of different features to the target feature. Thus, the spatial feature extraction of data is insufficient. To solve the problems mentioned above, based on the Gated Recurrent Neural Network, we design a new architecture named Auxiliary Information-GRU (AI-GRU) to extract deep temporal and spatial features and combined it into Auxiliary Information-deep Transition Network (Al-DTN). AI-GRU added three gating units, auxiliary information gate controls the amount of auxiliary information flowing into AI-DTN, fusion information gate controls the degree of fusion of target feature and auxiliary information, linear transformation gate isolates the target features from the auxiliary information. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the representative baseline models on the two benchmark datasets.

AB Fuel cell is the best suggestion to replace internal combustion engines. Fuel cell systems have no pollution and no moving parts. The efficiency of fuel cells is more than three times that of internal combustion engines. Modeling the behavior of solid oxide fuel cells has special complications, and determining its performance according to its structural characteristics is one of the required parameters to further understand the behavior of solid oxide fuel cells. In this study, a new methodology is presented for optimal parameters estimation of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) model. This paper's major goal was to provide a novel, efficient method for estimating the SOFC model's unknown parameters. To achieve this, the sum of squared errors between the output voltage of the proposed model and the experimental voltage measurements should be as little as possible. To reduce the error value, this study developed a better metaheuristic algorithm dubbed the Self-adaptive Henry Gas Solubility Optimizer. The developed method was then used with a 96-cell SOFC stack, and the sensitivity analysis was carried out while using various optimization algorithms at various temperatures and pressures. When 150 data points from a temperature sensitivity analysis at five temperatures, including 625 & DEG;C, 675 & DEG;C, 725 & DEG;C, and 775 & DEG;C under constant pressure, values of 3 atm, were taken into consideration, the smallest error was 9.41 e-5 for 575 & DEG;C. For pressure variations between 1 and 5 atm at constant temperatures of 775 & DEG;C, the lowest inaccuracy was 8.21 e-3 for 1 atm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more effective than the other techniques as an identifying tool.

AB Millimetre-wave radar offers high ranging accuracy and can capture subtle vibration information of the human heart. This study proposes a heartbeat prediction method based on the transformer model using millimetre-wave radar. Firstly, the millimetre-wave radar was used to collect the heartbeat data and conduct normalisation processing. Secondly, a position coding was introduced to assign sine or cosine variables to input data and extract their relative position relationship. Subsequently, the transformer encoder was adopted to allocate attention to input data through the multi-head attention mechanism, using a mask layer before the decoding layer to prevent the leakage of future information. Finally, we employ the fully connected layer was employed in the linear decoder for regression and output the predicted results. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transformer model achieves nearly 30% higher prediction accuracy than traditional long short-term memory models while improving both the prediction accuracy and convergence rate. The proposed method has great potential in predicting the heartbeat state of elderly and sick patients.

ID GRADIENT DESCENT
AB Over the past few decades, a lot of new neural network architectures and deep learning (DL)-based models have been developed to tackle problems more efficiently, rapidly, and accurately. For classification problems, it is typical to utilize fully connected layers as the network head. These dense layers used in such architectures have always remained the same - they use a linear transformation function that is a sum of the product of output vectors with weight vectors, and a trainable linear bias. In this study, we explore a different mechanism for the computation of a neuron's output. By adding a new feature, involving a product of higher order output vectors with their respective weight vectors, we transform the conventional linear function to higher order functions, involving powers over two. We compare and analyze the results obtained from six different transformation functions in terms of training and validation accuracies, on a custom neural network architecture, and with two benchmark datasets for image classification (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). While the dense layers perform better in all epochs with the new functions, the best performance is observed with a quadratic transformation function. Although the final accuracy achieved by the existing and new models remain the same, initial convergence to higher accuracies is always much faster in the proposed approach, thus significantly reducing the computational time and the computational resources required. This model can improve the performance of every DL architecture that uses a dense layer, with remarkably higher improvement in larger architectures that incorporate a very high number of parameters and output classes.

SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-view stereo; Depth estimation; Edge clues; 3D reconstruction
AB Deep learning has made great improvements in multi-view stereo. Recent approaches typically adopt raw images as input and estimate depth through deep networks. However, as a primary geometric cue, edge information, which captures the structures of scenes well, is ignored by the existing multi-view stereo networks. To this end, we present an Edge-aware Spatial Propagation Network, named ESPDepth, a novel depth estimation network that utilizes edges to assist in the understanding of scene structures. To be exact, we first generate a coarse initial depth map with a shallow network. Then we design an Edge Information Encoding (EIE) module, to encode edge-aware features from the initial depth. Subsequently, we apply the proposed Edge-Aware spatial Propagation (EAP) module, to guide the iterative propagation on cost volumes. Finally, the edge optimized cost volumes are utilized to obtain the final depth map, serving as a refinement process. By introducing the edge information in the propagation of cost volumes, the proposed method performs well when capturing geometric shapes, thus alleviating the negative effects of the greatly changed depth on edges of real scenes. Experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate our method produces precise depth estimation, gaining improvements both on global structures and detailed regions.

ID CARE MEASURE; OFFENDERS; CONSULTATION; NEUROSCIENCE; VALIDATION
AB Dialogue systems, from Virtual Personal Assistants such as Siri, Cortana, and Alexa to state-of-the-art systems such as BlenderBot3 and ChatGPT, are already widely available, used in a variety of applications, and are increasingly part of many people's lives. However, the task of enabling them to use empathetic language more convincingly is still an emerging research topic. Such systems generally make use of complex neural networks to learn the patterns of typical human language use, and the interactions in which the systems participate are usually mediated either via interactive text-based or speech-based interfaces. In human-human interaction, empathy has been shown to promote prosocial behaviour and improve interaction. In the context of dialogue systems, to advance the understanding of how perceptions of empathy affect interactions, it is necessary to bring greater clarity to how empathy is measured and assessed. Assessing the way dialogue systems create perceptions of empathy brings together a range of technological, psychological, and ethical considerations that merit greater scrutiny than they have received so far. However, there is currently no widely accepted evaluation method for determining the degree of empathy that any given system possesses (or, at least, appears to possess). Currently, different research teams use a variety of automated metrics, alongside different forms of subjective human assessment such as questionnaires, self-assessment measures and narrative engagement scales. This diversity of evaluation practice means that, given two DSs, it is usually impossible to determine which of them conveys the greater degree of empathy in its dialogic exchanges with human users. Acknowledging this problem, the present article provides an overview of how empathy is measured in human-human interactions and considers some of the ways it is currently measured in human-DS interactions. Finally, it introduces a novel third-person analytical framework, called the Empathy Scale for Human-Computer Communication (ESHCC), to support greater uniformity in how perceived empathy is measured during interactions with state-of-the-art DSs.

AB There is a large class of real-world problems, such as warehouse transport, at different scales, swarm densities, etc., that can be characterized as Central Place Foraging Problems (CPFPs). We contribute to swarm engineering by designing an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model that strives to capture the underlying behavioral dynamics of the CPFP in these application areas. Our simulation results show that a hybrid ODE modeling approach combining analytic parameter calculations and post-hoc (i.e., after running experiments) parameter fitting can be just as effective as a purely post-hoc approach to computing parameters via simulations, while requiring less tuning and iterative refinement. This makes it easier to design systems with provable bounds on behavior. Additionally, the resulting model parameters are more understandable because their values can be traced back to problem features, such as system size, robot control algorithm, etc. Finally, we perform real-robot experiments to further understand the limits of our model from an engineering standpoint.

AB Occlusion has always been a challenging research topic in the field of multi-target tracking. The invisibility of the target in full occlusion increases the difficulty of continuous tracking, which makes the recovery failure when the target is re-visible, and ultimately leads to a decrease in tracking accuracy. To address full occlusion problem, an effective multi-object tracking algorithm with full occlusion handle and adaptive fusion features is proposed. Firstly, a spatio-temporal model is established for full occlusion, and a simple, efficient and training-free method is proposed to find full occluded targets. Secondly, local high discrimination features with better stability and independence is proposed to realize effective correlation between targets before and after the full occlusion. Finally, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is proposed, which can adjust feature structure dynamically according to the occlusion state. The experimental results show that most evaluation metrics of the proposed algorithm are superior to those of some typical algorithms proposed in recent years under full occlusion tracking scenes. The proposed algorithm can realize accurate occluded targets identification and improve tracking robustness under short-term, long-term and frequent full occlusion.

AB Clinical records frequently include assessments of the characteristics of patients, which may include the completion of various questionnaires. These questionnaires provide a variety of perspectives on a patient's current state of well-being. Not only is it critical to capture the heterogeneity given by these perspectives, but there is also a growing demand for developing cost-effective technologies for clinical phenotyping. Filling out many questionnaires may be a strain for the patients and therefore, costly. Our goal is then to provide a strategy that refrains from the more expensive questionnaires while maintaining phenotype quality. In this work, we propose COBALT-a cost-based layer selector model for detecting phenotypes using a community detection approach. Our goal is to minimize the number of features used to build these phenotypes while preserving its quality. We test our model using questionnaire data from chronic tinnitus patients and represent the data in a multi-layer network structure. The model is then evaluated by predicting post-treatment data using baseline features (age, gender, and pre-treatment data) as well as the identified phenotypes as a feature. For some post-treatment variables, prediction models using phenotypes from COBALT as features outperformed those using phenotypes detected by traditional clustering methods. Moreover, using phenotype data to predict post-treatment data proved beneficial in comparison with prediction models that were solely trained with baseline features.

AB Time series forecasting models are gaining traction in many real-world domains as valuable decision support tools. Stock market analysis is a challenging domain, characterized by a complex multi-variate and time-evolving nature, with high volatility, and multiple correlations with exogenous factors. Autoregressive, machine learning, and deep learning models for temporal data have been adopted thus far to solve this task. However, they are usually limited to the analysis of a single data source or modality, and do not collectively deal with all the inherent challenges and complexities presented by stock market data. In this paper, inspired by the promising learning capabilities of hybrid ensemble methods, we propose a novel stacking ensemble approach for stock market prediction that jointly considers news headlines, multi-variate time series data, and multiple base models as predictors. By taking multiple factors into consideration, our model is able to learn historical patterns leveraging multiple data sources and models. Our experiments showcase the ability of our model to outperform popular baselines on next-day stock market trend prediction. A portfolio analysis reveals that our method is also able to yield potential gains or capital preservation capabilities when its predictions are exploited for trading decisions.

ID PRIVACY
AB Federated Learning (FL) improves the privacy of local training data by exchanging model updates (e.g., local gradients or updated parameters). Gradients and weights of the model have been presumed to be safe for delivery. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that gradient leakage attacks can reconstruct the input images at the pixel level, which belong to deep leakage. In addition, well understanding gradient leakage attacks are beneficial to model inversion attacks. Furthermore, gradient leakage attacks can be performed in a covert way, which does not hamper the training performance. It is significant to study gradient leakage attacks deeply. In this paper, a systematic literature review on gradient leakage attacks and privacy protection strategies. Through carefully screening, existing works about gradient leakage attacks can be categorized into three groups: (i) bias attacks, (ii) optimization-based attacks, and (iii) linear equation solver attacks. We propose one privacy attack system, i.e., single-sample reconstruction attack system (SSRAS). Furthermore, rank analysis index (RA-I) can be introduced to provide an overall estimate of the security of the neural network. In addition, we propose an Improved R-GAP Algorithm, this improved algorithm can carry out image reconstruction regardless of whether the label can be determined. Finally, experimental results show the superiority of the attack system over some other state-of-the-art attack algorithms.

Also, the information for owners who are trustworthy, traceable, secure ownership for the medical data that created seriousness in the security issues. The techniques and systems were centralized made difficult for sharing the medical data that have increased the single point of failure. The blockchain technology enabled the transparent, dependable, and auditable computing in various industries that used the decentralized network in the public ledger. The main objective is to exchange data in a safe and secure manner by using unalterable logs. To achieve and to improve the transparency, security and privacy, the verifiable digital signature with controlled blockchain enabled data records (DVS-CBDR) is introduced. Performance study of the proposed system has been assessed by a number of studies, examining throughput (170 tx/s), transaction response time (21 s), latency (5 s), memory usage (200 MB), and CPU utilization (98 Hz) which is better than patient-controlled blockchain enabled electronic health records for healthcare (PcBEHR).

AB Despite the enormous achievements of Deep Learning (DL) based models, their non-transparent nature led to restricted applicability and distrusted predictions. Such predictions emerge from erroneous In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, which results in disastrous effects in the medical domain, specifically in Medical Image Segmentation (MIS). To mitigate such effects, several existing works accomplish OOD sample detection; however, the trustworthiness issues from ID samples still require thorough investigation. To this end, a novel method TrustMIS (Trustworthy Medical Image Segmentation) is proposed in this paper, which provides the trustworthiness and improved performance of ID samples for DL-based MIS models. TrustMIS works in three folds: IT (Investigating Trustworthiness), INT (Improving Non-Trustworthy prediction) and CSO (Classifier Switching Operation). Initially, the IT method investigates the trustworthiness of MIS by leveraging similar characteristics and consistency analysis of input and its variants. Subsequently, the INT method employs the IT method to improve the performance of the MIS model. It leverages the observation that an input providing erroneous segmentation can provide correct segmentation with rotated input. Eventually, the CSO method employs the INT method to scrutinise several MIS models and selects the model that delivers the most trustworthy prediction. The experiments conducted on publicly available datasets using well-known MIS models reveal that TrustMIS has successfully provided a trustworthiness measure, outperformed the existing methods, and improved the performance of state-of-the-art MIS models.

TI Logistic Regression Matching Pursuit algorithm for text classification

DT Article
DE Text classification; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Strong Wolfe condition
AB Text classification is a challenging problem due to the high dimensionality of the text, which can limit classification performance. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is one of the most popular sparse recovery algorithms. An OMP based text classification algorithm, called the Logistic-OMP algorithm, was recently proposed by Skianis et al.. Simulation tests indicate that Logistic-OMP has excellent performance in text dimensionality reduction. This paper optimizes the Logistic-OMP algorithm, and proposes a new text classification algorithm called the Logistic Regression Matching Pursuit (LRMP) algorithm. The LRMP algorithm defines a new loss function and residual update function. It requires only one iteration to solve the negative log likelihood minimization problem, and its classification performance is guaranteed by the strong Wolfe condition, which makes it optimizes the classification accuracy while significantly speeding up the training speed. Simulation tests on topic classification and sentiment analysis from 20Newsgroups, Amazon product reviews, and movie reviews datasets show that the LRMP algorithm has a shorter computation time of a single iteration than the Logistic-OMP algorithm, with a total training time of 8.08%-21.16% shorter than that of the Logistic-OMP algorithm, and the memory usage is 3.20%-6.21% lower than that of the Logistic-OMP algorithm. Furthermore, the average Accuracy and F1-Score of the LRMP algorithm are improved by 1.61%-26.55% and 1.83%-25.46%, respectively, compared with the benchmark classifier. Compared with the advanced classifiers (including Logistic-OMP), the average Accuracy and F1-Score of the LRMP algorithm are improved by 0.46%-8.97% and 0.57%-9.40%, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cause of Death estimation from Verbal Autopsies: Is the Open Response
   redundant or synergistic?
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Civil registration and vital statistics systems capture birth and death events to compile vital statistics and to provide legal rights to citizens. Vital statistics are a key factor in promoting public health policies and the health of the population. Medical certification of cause of death is the preferred source of cause of death information. However, two thirds of all deaths worldwide are not captured in routine mortality information systems and their cause of death is unknown. Verbal autopsy is an interim solution for estimating the cause of death distribution at the population level in the absence of medical certification. A Verbal Autopsy (VA) consists of an interview with the relative or the caregiver of the deceased. The VA includes both Closed Questions (CQs) with structured answer options, and an Open Response (OR) consisting of a free narrative of the events expressed in natural language and without any pre-determined structure. There are a number of automated systems to analyze the CQs to obtain cause specific mortality fractions with limited performance. We hypothesize that the incorporation of the text provided by the OR might convey relevant information to discern the CoD. The experimental layout compares existing Computer Coding Verbal Autopsy methods such as Tariff 2.0 with other approaches well suited to the processing of structured inputs as is the case of the CQs. Next, alternative approaches based on language models are employed to analyze the OR. Finally, we propose a new method with a bi-modal input that combines the CQs and the OR. Empirical results corroborated that the CoD prediction capability of the Tariff 2.0 algorithm is outperformed by our method taking into account the valuable information conveyed by the OR. As an added value, with this work we made available the software to enable the reproducibility of the results attained with a version implemented in R to make the comparison with Tariff 2.0 evident.

ID PROCESSOR; CHIP
AB Robotics faces a long-standing obstacle in which the speed of the vision system's scene understanding is insufficient, impeding the robot's ability to perform agile tasks. Consequently, robots must often rely on interpolation and extrapolation of the vision data to accomplish tasks in a timely and effective manner. One of the primary reasons for these delays is the analog-to-digital conversion that occurs on a per-pixel basis across the image sensor, along with the transfer of pixel-intensity information to the host device. This results in significant delays and power consumption in modern visual processing pipelines. The SCAMP-5-a general-purpose Focal-plane Sensor-processor array (FPSP)-used in this research performs computations in the analog domain prior to analog-to-digital conversion. By extracting features from the image on the focal plane, the amount of data that needs to be digitised and transferred is reduced. This allows for a high frame rate and low energy consumption for the SCAMP-5. The focus of our work is on localising the camera within the scene, which is crucial for scene understanding and for any downstream robotics tasks. We present a localisation system that utilise the FPSP in two parts. First, a 6-DoF odometry system is introduced, which efficiently estimates its position against a known marker at over 400 FPS. Second, our work is extended to implement BIT-VO-6-DoF visual odometry system which operates under an unknown natural environment at 300 FPS.

AB There is extensive literature dating back to the Markowitz model on portfolio optimization. Recently, with the introduction of deep models in finance, there has been a shift in the trend of portfolio optimization toward data-driven models, departing from the traditional model-based approaches. However, deep portfolio models often encounter issues due to the non-stationary nature of data, giving unstable results. To address this issue, we advocate the utilization of graph neural networks to incorporate graphical knowledge and enhance model stability, thereby improving results in comparison with state-of-the-art recurrent architectures. Moreover, we conduct an analysis of the algorithmic risk-return trade-off for deep portfolio optimization models, offering insights into risk for fully data-driven models.

AB Siamese-based trackers have achieved outstanding tracking performance. However, these trackers in complex scenarios struggle to adequately integrate the valuable target feature information, which results in poor tracking performance. In this paper, a novel shared-encoder dual-pipeline Transformer architecture is proposed to achieve robust visual tracking. The proposed method integrates several main components based on a hybrid attention mechanism, namely the shared encoder, the feature enhancement pipelines with functional complementarity, and the pipeline feature fusion head. The shared encoder is adopted to process template features and provide useful target feature information for the feature enhancement pipeline. The feature enhancement pipeline is responsible for enhancing feature information, establishing feature dependencies between the template and the search region, and employing global information adequately. To further correlate the global information, the pipeline feature fusion head integrates the feature information from the feature enhancement pipelines. Eventually, we propose a robust Siamese-based Repformer tracker, which incorporates a concise tracking prediction network to obtain efficient tracking representations. Experiments show that our tracking method surpasses numerous state-of-the-art trackers on multiple tracking benchmarks, with a running speed of 57.3 fps.

ID IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; NETWORK; REDUCTION
AB Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is desirable due to ionizing radiation, but the resulting images suffer from serious streak artifacts and spot noise. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives for medical image processing. However, most DL-based methods are built intuitively and lack interpretability, and it is difficult to effectively separate the artifacts and noise in LDCT images. Obtaining diagnostically useful images, especially when using a low-dose scanner protocol, remains an open challenge. To improve the quality of LDCT images, we developed a novel processing network called the sparse autorepresentation U-Net (SureUnet). First, inspired by multilayer convolutional sparse coding (CSC), we constructed a sparse autorepresentation encoder to sufficiently capture and represent hierarchical image features. Then, we chose the widely used U-Net model for sparse autorepresentation block applications and designed SureUnet by adding a feature decoding block. Therefore, every module has well-defined interpretability in our network. Additionally, hybrid loss functions were specifically designed, including the mean absolute error, edge loss and perceptual loss. Through the cooperation of multiple loss functions, the noise artifact suppression effect of the network was improved. The visual results obtained on the MAYO and UIH datasets show that the proposed method's noise artifact suppression effect was more significant. The quantitative results showed promising improvement levels compared to those of the other state-of-the-art methods. The SureUnet model significantly outperformed the compared methods on two datasets, with margins of 0.4 dB for the PSNR, 0.007 for the SSIM, and 1.6 for the FID on the MAYO dataset and margins of 0.5 dB for the PSNR, 0.004 for the SSIM and 2.9 for the FID on the UIH dataset. This work paves the way for sparse autorepresentation in DL for processing LDCT images. Experimental results have demonstrated the competitive performance of SureUnet in terms of noise suppression, structural fidelity and visual impression improvement.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal kinds of cancer, so early detection is critical. Three datasets, namely CNN transfer learning with discrete wavelet transform (DWT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), and support vector machines (SVMs), were used to find CRC. In these instances, a quick and precise visual diagnosis of polyps is needed in the current scenario. The proposed process involves four distinct phases. First and foremost, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are developed to test the efficacy of the model. Further, a transfer learning approach was incorporated using SVM and LSTM. Using the K-means technique, a visual explanation is finally presented. This system works with the balanced Hyper Kvasir and mixed datasets, which are made up of CVC Clinic DB, Kvasir2, and Hyper Kvasir. The system is called "ColoRectalCADx". The convolutional neural network (CNN) models are ResNet-50V2, DenseNet-201, VGG-16, and RDV-22. The system achieved the highest accuracy with CNN DesnseNet-201 in Hyper Kvasir (98.92% training, 98.91% testing, 93.62% SVM training, and 95.87% SVM tests). CNN DenseNet-201 also achieved the highest accuracy with the mixed dataset (98.91% training, 96.13% testing, 95.41% SVM training, and 94.86% SVM testing). The process involved three phases, namely individual CNN, combination of CNN with SVM, and combination of CNN, LSTM, and SVM. After three phases of the system, across both datasets, the CNN + SVM + LSTM combination was proven to be the most effective. Finally, the unsupervised K-means learning algorithm extracts the location of any cancerous polyps and upon classification using SVM classifier resulted with an accuracy of 80%. The K-means algorithm, which uses segmented images as input, accurately predicts the sites of tumours in colorectal cancer patients.

AB Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. Epileptics are prone to sudden seizures that cause disruptions in their daily lives. The separation of epileptic and non-epileptic activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and identification of the form of epileptic activity play critical roles in providing patients with appropriate treatment. To recognize epileptic seizures, medical experts visually inspect recordings of EEG signals, which require much time and effort. Therefore, a seizure detection system can improve the monitoring and diagnosis of epilepsy and reduce the doctors' workload. This paper presents an end-to-end automated seizure detection method based on deep learning that does not require considerable EEG data preprocessing or feature extraction. As a result presents a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (1D-CNN-LSTM) model for differentiating normal, ictal, and interictal EEG data. This method is evaluated using the University of Bonn (BoU) and Neurology and Sleep Centre database (NSC). We achieved accuracy values of 99-100% for the BoU dataset and 100% for the NSC dataset with our best model. In contrast with recent studies, our hybrid automated approach does not require any pre-selected features to be estimated and shows high performance with promising possibilities for their use in clinical practice.

AB Automated personality traits prediction from widely available social media text data, is finding its increased applications in recommender systems, psychology, forecasting, and decision making. The aim of this research is to break the digital text data into features, analyse and map it to an appropriate personality model. Because of its simplicity and shown competence, a well-known personality model known as the Big Five personality characteristics has frequently been welcomed in the literature as the norm for personality evaluation. Recent advances in automated personality detection have focused on including sentiments, emotions, linguistic styles, and other natural language processing techniques. All these approaches are proposed by a fact concerned with the limited amount of data available for processing by deep learning algorithms. Personality datasets with conventional personality labels are few, and collecting them is challenging due to privacy concerns, as well as the high expense of hiring expert psychologists to label them. The performance of the model can even be increased if a large amount of labelled data is available. This research proposes a new personality prediction model using data source mapping and data fusion techniques. The results are evident that the proposed methodology has outperformed the existing methodologies. To be more precise, the results had the highest accuracy of 87.89% and 0.924 F1 measure score after mapping MBTI into Big Five personality traits and later, fusion with Essays and myPersonality datasets.

AB Recent advances in digital technologies have lowered the costs and improved the quality of digital pathology Whole Slide Images (WSI), opening the door to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to assist in cancer diagnosis. ML, including Deep Learning (DL), has produced impressive results in diverse image classification tasks in pathology, such as predicting clinical outcomes in lung cancer and inferring regional gene expression signatures. Despite these promising results, the uptake of ML as a common diagnostic tool in pathology remains limited. A major obstacle is the insufficient labelled data for training neural networks and other classifiers, especially for new sites where models have not been established yet. Recently, image synthesis from small, labelled datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been used successfully to create high-performing classification models. Considering the domain shift and complexity in annotating data, we investigated an approach based on GAN that minimized the differences in WSI between large public data archive sites and a much smaller data archives at the new sites. The proposed approach allows the tuning of a deep learning classification model for the class of interest to be improved using a small training set available at the new sites. This paper utilizes GAN with the one-class classification concept to model the class of interest data. This approach minimizes the need for large amounts of labelled data from the new site to train the network. The GAN generates synthesized one-class WSI images to jointly train the classifier with WSIs available from the new sites. We tested the proposed approach for follicular lymphoma data of a new site by utilizing the data archives from different sites. The synthetic images for the one-class data generated from the data obtained from different sites with minimum amount of data from the new site have resulted in a significant improvement of 15% for the Area Under the curve (AUC) for the new site that we want to establish a new follicular lymphoma classifier. The test results have shown that the classifier can perform well without the need to obtain more training data from the test site, by utilizing GAN to generate the synthetic data from all existing data in the archives from all the sites.

AB To handle uncertain information where opinion has more than two aspects, the frame of T-spherical fuzzy (TSF) set is of significance. The goal of this paper is to introduce some aggregation operators (AOs) based on trigonometric function of sine, i.e., sine trigonometric aggregation operators (STAOs) for TSF information. The validity of the STAOs is checked using the properties of idempotency, monotonicity and boundedness. These operators incorporate the unique features of the sine trigonometry function and are designed to meet the decision-making requirements for the assessment of objects. A multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) algorithm is proposed to see the applicability of the proposed STAOs in a human resource management problem. To strengthen our study, we provide a comparative analysis with existing research in the field and the superiority of the proposed approach is discussed. It is shown that the proposed operator deals with processing of the information better than the existing operators.

ID SPECKLE REDUCTION
AB For the longest time, filters have been proposed to reduce speckle noise present in the medical images for improved visual quality and quantitative image analysis. Of the numerous image restoration and denoising techniques around, one of the most basic and productive is a neural network system-based noise suppression technique. Though noise suppression techniques perform well, they fail to preserve image edges. Consequently, denoising of medical images is a major area of research. This paper proposes a median filter-based multistage neural network for speckle noise suppression. The proposed method has two stages, median filter is used in the initial filtering stage. Statistical features extracted from its output are utilized to train the multistage neural network. The filtered images are again denoised using the multistage neural network, following which there is a performance evaluation using several assessment metrics. The proposed method has been evaluated on two different datasets namely breast ultrasound dataset and multispectral image dataset images. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of the PSNR of 53.80%, SSIM of 98.54, EPI of 0.74, ENL of 96.62% and SSI of 0.22, respectively, for the breast ultrasound images and also, produces the PSNR of 67.38%, SSIM of 98%, EPI of 0.72, SSIM of 98.93% and the EPI of 0.32, respectively, for the multispectral images.

AB Active contour models (ACMs) have been widely used in image segmentation to segment objects. However, when it comes to segmenting images with severe intensity inhomogeneity, most current frameworks do not perform well, which can make it difficult to achieve the desired results. To address this issue, a decision-making model is proposed, which involves using enhanced local direction pattern (ELDP) and local directional number pattern (LDNP) texture descriptors to create an encoded-texture ACM. The principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to optimize the two encoded images and reduce the correlations before they are fused. To further improve the performance of the encoded-texture ACM, a function of minimizing energy globally (FMEG) is suggested by applying the vector-valued exploration technique from a non-convex surface to region-based ACMs. This approach enables the development of a model capable of directly building complex decision boundaries. The experimental results show that the proposed encoded-texture ACM outperforms many recent frameworks in terms of robustness and accuracy for segmenting images with intensity inhomogeneity, fuzzy boundaries, and noise. Therefore, the suggested approach provides a more effective and efficient solution to the problem of image segmentation, particularly for challenging images.

AB Globally, one among the most prominent cause of death is lung cancer, which is the most malignant tumorin human health. Hence, automatically detecting or diagnosing lung disease as of computerized tomographic scan image is the necessary application. Numerous cancer classification systems have been engendered for this. However, it is not easy to determine the presence of tumors in small nodules. Hence, a novel Aquila-optimized mish dropout-deep convolutional neural network (AmiD-DCNN) cancer classification system was proposed in this paper. The noises are eliminated by utilizing an adaptive median filter initially and the Chi-square distribution adapted contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is utilized to elevate the contrast. The residual unity AlexNet is utilized to segment the lung regions from the preprocessed image; also the Jaccard similarity and quadratic kernel-induced profuse clustering are employed to extract the cancerous region. The features are extracted after those steps, which are then fed to the Amid-DCNN classifier to classify cancer. The experiments are evaluated along with analogized with the benchmark models. The proposed model's efficient performance was demonstrated by the experimental outcomes.

AB As an important indicator of the surface quality of workpieces, surface roughness has a great impact on production costs and the quality performance of the finished components. Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies.

AB The stabilization problem for a class of stochastic reaction-diffusion delayed Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (SRDDCGNNs) with event-triggered controllers is addressed in this paper. Neumann boundary conditions, distributed and bounded external disturbances are introduced to solve such a problem. New sufficient criteria are derived using the 2-norm event generator and Lyapunov functional to ensure that the proposed controlled systems achieve practically exponential input-to-state stabilization in terms of the linear matrix inequality. Considering these criteria, the impact of an event-triggered controller on the practically exponential input-to-state stability is investigated. The Zeno phenomenon of the event-triggered controller is avoided. Moreover, the obtained results are successfully applied to SRDDCNNs and stochastic reaction-diffusion delayed Hopfield neural networks (SRDDHNNs). Finally, the main results are illustrated with simulation results and the SRDDHNNs are applied to image encryption.

AB Based on the network structure and training methods of extreme learning machines, extreme learning machine combining hidden-layer feature weighting and batch training (ELM-WB) is proposed to make full use of representation-level features for object images and human action videos classification. To solve the problem of insufficient fusion of multiple representation-level features in most classification methods, a double hidden layer structure in which the input layer and the second hidden layer are directly connected is designed. A loop training method of weighting coefficients and output weights is proposed based on the advantages of this structure. The proposed network structure and training method are combined to construct an extreme learning machine combining hidden-layer feature weighting (ELM-W), which can effectively fuse representation-level features to enhance the classification ability of representation-level features. On this basis, the principle of online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) is introduced to update the loop training formula of the two weights to reduce the memory consumption during the operation of the overall algorithm. ELM-WB is proposed by combining the loop training formula of two weight matrices with batch training. In order to test the feasibility of ELM-WB, experiments are conducted on Caltech 101, MSRC, UCF11 and UCF101 databases. Experimental results prove that the proposed ELM-WB can improve classification accuracy by fusing representation-level features. At the same time, ELM-WB can be used to perform classification tasks on databases of any size in a general-purpose computer without specific hardware.

ID NETWORK
AB RGB and Thermal (RGBT) tracking is an important supplement of visual object tracking for its' unique practical and research value. However, due to the limitations of the RGBT camera, extra interferences are introduced in the data synchronously. Removing or alleviating these interferences is a crucial direction to improve the performance of the RGBT tracking task. For this problem, we propose the multi-stage matching guidance and context integration network (M2GCI) for RGBT tracking. M2GCI reorganizes the feature-encoding pipeline into two context-integrating stages that are responsible for processing primary and senior information respectively. Firstly, the primary features encoded from primary encoders are integrated by the spatially adaptive fusion strategy. Next, the senior encoders cooperating with axial external-attention redistribution strategy further extract senior features which are more reliable for target prediction. Extensive experiments on the RGBT234 and GTOT provide that the proposed M2GCI can achieve more precision and robust tracking under some difficult scenarios compared with the excellent methods.

AB This paper focuses on a scheduling problem of the evaporation and encapsulation (EVEN) line in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display manufacturing towards minimizing total setup time and tardiness of allocated jobs. This scheduling problem is an unrelated dedicated parallel machine scheduling (UDPMS) problem with practical complex constraints including machine availability, family setup, preventive maintenance (PM), and job splitting. There are three major points to this problem. First, the processing of a job on a machine should be completed before its due date. Second, setups should be reduced to minimize labor costs. Finally, a job is able to be split into one or more sub-jobs for processing on machines independently. To obtain a schedule to minimize total setup time and tardiness of allocated jobs, we suggest two novel machine schedulers such as deep learning-based and self-growth learning-based schedulers, called DLS and SGLS, respectively. Although the structure of the proposed schedulers is identical, especially, SGLS incrementally learns to explore more effective allocation patterns by preserving the obtained knowledge from the trained DLS based on self-growth learning. The comprehensive experiments show that SGLS produces satisfactory schedules in terms of minimizing total setup time and tardiness. In particular, when the number of jobs and the ratio of job sizes are larger, SGLS achieves a schedule with both less setup time and tardiness compared to others. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rapid economic growth and rising energy consumption have inevitably led to environmental problems, which is a cutting-edge issue of sustainable development. To distinguish the internal structure of marine and land economy-energy-environment (3E) systems and the non-linear relationships between the variables, a novel structural-adaptive fractional time-delay nonlinear systematic grey prediction model (FTDNSGM(1,m)) is established. Additionally, the solving process of each layer model of FTDNSGM(1,m) is described in detail, and the derived models of underlying layer FBTDGM(1,1) and upper layer FBTDGM(1,N) are deduced respectively, which constitute the nested grey difference equations. Furthermore, combined with comparative analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation, optimal non-linear parameters are determined by Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO) algorithm with robustness. Empirically, based on five case datasets under the national-regional dimensions, the FTDNSGM(1,m) model is scientifically verified to have superlative validity and stability. The results demonstrate that the average MAPEs of the proposed model in training and test sets are 0.38%, 0.28%, 0.34%, 0.26%, 0.21%, and 0.38%, 0.88%, 0.47%, 1.36%, 0.67%. Ulteriorly, the proposed model is of applicability to assess the impact on 3E systems attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Predictably, from 2022 to 2025, with sustained economic growth, marine and land energy consumption will rise within reasonable limits, while coastal water quality will continue to grow and NOx emissions will keep going down.

TI Self-Supervised Time Series Representation Learning via Cross
   Reconstruction Transformer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Cross domain; self-supervised learning; time series; transformer
AB Since labeled samples are typically scarce in realworld scenarios, self-supervised representation learning in time series is critical. Existing approaches mainly employ the contrastive learning framework, which automatically learns to understand similar and dissimilar data pairs. However, they are constrained by the request for cumbersome sampling policies and prior knowledge of constructing pairs. Also, few works have focused on effectively modeling temporal-spectral correlations to improve the capacity of representations. In this article, we propose the cross reconstruction transformer (CRT) to solve the aforementioned issues. CRT achieves time series representation learning through a cross-domain dropping-reconstruction task. Specifically, we obtain the frequency domain of the time series via the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and randomly drop certain patches in both time and frequency domains. Dropping is employed to maximally preserve the global context while masking leads to the distribution shift. Then a Transformer architecture is utilized to adequately discover the cross-domain correlations between temporal and spectral information through reconstructing data in both domains, which is called Dropped Temporal-Spectral Modeling. To discriminate the representations in global latent space, we propose instance discrimination constraint (IDC) to reduce the mutual information between different time series samples and sharpen the decision boundaries. Additionally, a specified curriculum learning (CL) strategy is employed to improve the robustness during the pretraining phase, which progressively increases the dropping ratio in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on multiple realworld datasets. Results show that CRT consistently achieves the best performance over existing methods by 2%-9%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/BobZwr/CrossReconstruction-Transformer.

ID RELATIONAL AUTONOMY; ETHICS
AB Recommender Systems (RecSys) have been around since the early days of the Internet, helping users navigate the vast ocean of information and the increasingly available options that have been available for us ever since. The range of tasks for which one could use a RecSys is expanding as the technical capabilities grow, with the disruption of Machine Learning representing a tipping point in this domain, as in many others. However, the increase of the technical capabilities of AI-powered RecSys did not come with a thorough consideration of their ethical implications and, despite being a well-established technical domain, the potential impacts of RecSys on their users are still under-assessed. This paper aims at filling this gap in regards to one of the main impacts of RecSys: personal autonomy. We first describe how technology can affect human values and a suitable methodology to identify these effects and mitigate potential harms: Value Sensitive Design (VSD). We use VSD to carry out a conceptual investigation of personal autonomy in the context of a generic RecSys and draw on a nuanced account of procedural autonomy to focus on two components: competence and authenticity. We provide the results of our inquiry as a value hierarchy and apply it to the design of a speculative RecSys as an example.

ID DESIGN; VIDEO
AB Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising technique that captures a 3-D hyperspectral image (HSI) by a 2-D detector in a compressed manner. The ill-posed inverse process of reconstructing the HSI from their corresponding 2-D measurements is challenging. However, current approaches either neglect the underlying characteristics, such as high spectral correlation, or demand abundant training datasets, resulting in an inadequate balance among performance, generalizability, and interpretability. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel approach called LR2DP that integrates the model-driven low-rank prior and data-driven deep priors for SCI reconstruction. This approach not only captures the spectral correlation and deep spatial features of HSI but also takes advantage of both model-based and learning-based methods without requiring any extra training datasets. Specifically, to preserve the strong spectral correlation of the HSI effectively, we propose that the HSI lies in a low-rank subspace, thereby transforming the problem of reconstructing the HSI into estimating the spectral basis and spatial representation coefficient. Inspired by the mutual promotion of unsupervised deep image prior (DIP) and trained deep denoising prior (DDP), we integrate the unsupervised network and pre-trained deep denoiser into the plug-and-play (PnP) regime to estimate the representation coefficient together, aiming to explore the internal target image prior (learned by DIP) and the external training image prior (depicted by pre-trained DDP) of the HSI. An effective half-quadratic splitting (HQS) technique is employed to optimize the proposed HSI reconstruction model. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Sensors are the key to environmental monitoring, which impart benefits to smart cities in many aspects, such as providing real-time air quality information to assist human decision-making. However, it is impractical to deploy massive sensors due to the expensive costs, resulting in sparse data collection. Therefore, how to get fine-grained data measurement has long been a pressing issue. In this article, we aim to infer values at nonsensor locations based on observations from available sensors (termed spatiotemporal inference), where capturing spatiotemporal relationships among the data plays a critical role. Our investigations reveal two significant insights that have not been explored by previous works. First, data exhibit distinct patterns at both long-and short-term temporal scales, which should be analyzed separately. Second, short-term patterns contain more delicate relations, including those across spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously, while long-term patterns involve high-level temporal trends. Based on these observations, we propose to decouple the modeling of short-and long-term patterns. Specifically, we introduce a joint spatiotemporal graph attention network to learn the relations across space and time for short-term patterns. Furthermore, we propose a graph recurrent network with a time skip strategy to alleviate the gradient vanishing problem and model the long-term dependencies. Experimental results on four public real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively captures both long-and short-term relations, achieving state-of-the-art performance against existing methods.

AB Neural networks tend to suffer performance deterioration on previous tasks when they are applied to multiple tasks sequentially without access to previous data. The problem is commonly known as catastrophic forgetting, a significant challenge in continual learning (CL). To overcome the catastrophic forgetting, regularization-based CL methods construct a regularization-based term, which can be considered as the approximation loss function of previous tasks, to penalize the update of parameters. However, the rigorous theoretical analysis of regularization-based methods is limited. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the forgetting and the convergence properties of regularization-based methods. The theoretical results demonstrate that the upper bound of the forgetting has a relationship with the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. Hence, to decrease the upper bound of the forgetting, we propose eiGenvalues ExplorAtion Regularization-based (GEAR) method, which explores the geometric properties of the approximation loss of prior tasks regarding the maximum eigenvalue. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting and outperforms existing regularization-based methods.

AB At present, multimodal medical image fusion technology has become an essential means for researchers and doctors to predict diseases and study pathology. Nevertheless, how to reserve more unique features from different modal source images on the premise of ensuring time efficiency is a tricky problem. To handle this issue, we propose a flexible semantic-guided architecture with a mask-optimized framework in an end-to-end manner, termed as GeSeNet. Specifically, a region mask module is devised to deepen the learning of important information while pruning redundant computation for reducing the runtime. An edge enhancement module and a global refinement module are presented to modify the extracted features for boosting the edge textures and adjusting overall visual performance. In addition, we introduce a semantic module that is cascaded with the proposed fusion network to deliver semantic information into our generated results. Sufficient qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments (i.e., MRI-CT, MRI-PET, and MRI-SPECT) are deployed between our proposed method and ten state-of-the-art methods, which shows our generated images lead the way. Moreover, we also conduct operational efficiency comparisons and ablation experiments to prove that our proposed method can perform excellently in the field of multimodal medical image fusion. The code is available at https://github.com/lok-18/GeSeNet.

AB Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to understand the attitudes and views of opinion holders with computers. Previous studies have achieved significant breakthroughs and extensive applications in the past decade, such as public opinion analysis and intelligent voice service. With the rapid development of deep learning, SA based on various modalities has become a research hotspot. However, only individual modality has been analyzed separately, lacking a systematic carding of comprehensive SA methods. Meanwhile, few surveys covering the topic of multimodal SA (MSA) have been explored yet. In this article, we first take the modality as the thread to design a novel framework of SA tasks to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of relevant advances in SA. Then, we introduce the general workflows and recent advances of single-modal in detail, discuss the similarities and differences of single-modal SA in data processing and modeling to guide MSA, and summarize the commonly used datasets to provide guidance on data and methods for researchers according to different task types. Next, a new taxonomy is proposed to fill the research gaps in MSA, which is divided into multimodal representation learning and multimodal data fusion. The similarities and differences between these two methods and the latest advances are described in detail, such as dynamic interaction between multimodalities, and the multimodal fusion technologies are further expanded. Moreover, we explore the advanced studies on multimodal alignment, chatbots, and Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in SA. Finally, we discuss the open research challenges of MSA and provide four potential aspects to improve future works, such as cross-modal contrastive learning and multimodal pretraining models.

AB When projecting and building new industrial facilities, getting integrated design alternatives and maintenance strategies are of critical importance to achieve the physical assets optimal performance, which is needed to be competitive in the actual global markets. Coupling Evolutionary Algorithms with Discrete Event Simulation has been explored both in relation to systems design and their maintenance strategy. However, it was not simultaneously considered when both the corrective and the preventive maintenance-consisting of achieving the optimum period of time to carry out a preventive maintenance activity-are taken into account before being considered by the authors of the present paper. This work couples Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms with Discrete Event Simulation in order to enhance the knowledge and efficiency of the methodology presented, which consists of exploring and optimizing simultaneously systems design alternatives and their preventive maintenance strategies. The aim consists of finding the best set of non-dominated solutions by using the system availability (first maximized objective function) with taking into consideration associated operational cost (second minimized objective function), while automatically selecting the system devices. Each solution proposed by the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm is analyzed by using Discrete Event Simulation in a procedure that looks at the effect of including periodic preventive maintenance activities all along the mission time. An industrial application case study is solved, and a comparison of the performance of five state-of-the-art and three more recently developed Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms is handled; moreover, the gap in the literature reviewed about the analysis regarding the effect of the discrete event simulation sampling size is faced with useful insights about the synergies of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms and Discrete Event Simulation. Finally, the methodology is expanded to more complex systems which are successfully solved.

AB Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in Computer Vision. In practical applications, the datasets are usually not as abundant as those in the laboratory and simulation, which is always called as Data Hungry. How to extract the information of data more completely and effectively is very important. Therefore, an Adaptive Data Augmentation Framework based on the tensor T-product Operator is proposed in this paper, to triple one image data to be trained and gain the result from all these three images together with only <0.1% increase in the number of parameters. At the same time, this framework serves the functions of column image embedding and global feature intersection, enabling the model to obtain information in not only spatial but frequency domain, and thus improving the prediction accuracy of the model. Numerical experiments have been designed for several models, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive framework. Numerical experiments show that our data augmentation framework can improve the performance of original neural network model by 2%, which provides competitive results to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Given the rise of the tourism industry, there is an increasing urgency among tourists to access information about various tourist attractions. To address this challenge, innovative solutions have emerged, utilizing recommendation algorithms to offer customers personalized product recommendations. Nonetheless, existing recommen-dation algorithms predominantly rely on textual data, which is insufficient to harness the full potential of online tourism data. The most valuable tourism information is often found in the multi-modal data on social media, characterized by its voluminous and content-rich nature. Against this backdrop, our article posits a groundbreaking travel recommendation algorithm that leverages multi-modal data mining techniques. The proposed algorithm uses a travel recommendation platform, designed using multi-vector word sense segmentation and multi-modal data fusion, to improve the recommendation performance by introducing topic words. In our final experimental comparison, we verify the recommendation performance of the proposed algorithm on the real data set of TripAdvisor. Our proposed algorithm has the best degree of confusion with various topics. With a LOP of 20, the Precision and MAP values reach 0.0026 and 0.0089, respectively. It has the potential to better serve the tourism industry in terms of tourist destination recommendations. It can effectively mine the multi -modal data of the tourism industry to generate more excellent economic and social value.

AB Multi-robot cooperation is a typical application of multi-robot system, which has strong potential applications in many special occasions. However, few scholars have considered cooperative optimization transportation from the perspective of optimization. This paper investigates the cooperative transportation optimization problem for multiple mobile robots with kinematically redundant manipulators. First, a discrete-time distributed optimization algorithm with fixed step size is proposed to achieve linear convergence. Second, by introducing a rotation variable into the optimization problem, the joint angular velocity of manipulator and the velocity of moving platform change more smoothly. Third, a virtual leader-follower transport strategy is used in this paper to improve the stability of the multi-robot system. In the physical experiment, the trajectory of each end-effector matches the expected trajectory, and the center trajectory of the transport object almost coincides with the virtual leader trajectory with acceptable error.

AB The solar system boundary exploration mission has the characteristics of long flight time, high fuel consumption, complex gravity-assist sequence and strict constraints. Therefore, the number of decision variables and the search space of the transfer trajectory are very large, resulting in poor convergence and efficiency of the global search of the metaheuristic algorithm. Moreover, the existing gravity assist space pruning algorithm is no longer applicable for solar system boundary exploration. To effectively reduce the search space and improve the effect of trajectory optimization, an improved gravity assist space pruning algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a unique pruning procedure is used to effectively prune the search space, a shape of solution space box bounds combining rectangle and rhombus is adopted, and a method to automatically determine the solution space box bounds is presented. To verify the effectiveness of the improved gravity assist space pruning algorithm, the sensitivity of pruning effect to parameters is analyzed and the optimization effects of three typical metaheuristics are compared. The optimization results of 50 repeated runs of the differential evolution algorithm in the entire search space and the solution space box bounds are compared. Simulation results show that the performance of differential evolution algorithm is better than bat algorithm and firefly algorithm. And the improved pruning algorithm can increase the efficiency of subsequent optimization by more than eleven times and the convergence probability of the objective function by fifty of times. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed method for the solar system boundary exploration are demonstrated.

AB Deepfake technology, especially deep voice, which has been derived from artificial intelligence in recent years, is potentially harmful, and the public is not yet wary. However, many speech synthesis models measure the degree of true restitution by Mean Opinion Rating (MOS), a subjective assessment of naturalness and quality of speech by human subjects, but in future it will be difficult to distinguish the interlocutor's identity through the screen. For this reason, this study addresses the threat posed by this new technology by combining representational learning and 0transfer learning in two sub-systems: a recognition system and a voice print system. The recognition system is responsible for the detection of which voice is a fake voice generated by speech conversion or speech synthesis techniques, while the acoustic system is responsible for the verification of the speaker's identity through acoustic features. In the speech recognition system, we use the representation learning method and the transfer classification method. We use X-vector data for training, and then fine-tune the model using four types of marker data to learn the representation vectors of real and fake voice, and use support vector machine to classify real and fake voice in the back-end to reduce the negative effect of the new technique.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB Due to the problem of low tracking accuracy and weak tracking stability of current multi-object pedestrian tracking algorithms in complex scenes for videos, a Detection-based Online Multi-Object Pedestrian Tracking (DOMOPT) network is proposed. First, a Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF) pedestrian detection network is proposed based on the Center and Scale Prediction (CSP) algorithm. The pyramid convolutional neural network is used as the backbone to enhance the feature extraction capability for small objects. The shallow features and deep features at multiple levels are integrated to fully obtain the position and semantic information to further improve the detection performance for small objects. Then, on the basis of Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE) architecture, a Multi-Branch Pedestrian Appearance (MBPA) feature extraction network is proposed and added into the pedestrian detection network to extract the appearance feature vector corresponding to each pedestrian. The pedestrian appearance feature extraction is treated as a classification task jointly training with the pedestrian detection task, using the multi-task learning strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed network has better tracking accuracy and stability compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB As a meta-heuristic algorithm, the ant colony algorithm has been successfully used to solve various combinatorial optimization problems. However, the existing algorithm that takes the power of ants to solve distributed constraint optimization problems (ACO_DCOP) is easy to fall into local optima. To deal with this issue, this paper presents an adaptive ant colony algorithm based on local information entropy to solve distributed constraint optimization problems, named LIEAD. In LIEAD, the local information entropy is introduced to help agents adaptively select the pheromone update strategy and value selection strategy, which improves the convergence speed and the quality of the solution. Moreover, a restart mechanism is designed to break the accumulation state of pheromone, which increases the population diversity and helps the algorithm jump out of the local optima. The extensive experimental results indicate that LIEAD can significantly outperform ACO_DCOP and is competitive with the state-of-the-art DCOPs algorithms.

AB Big data is a large set of data that is analyzed with the calculation to manifest myriad sources. Big data is capable of handling various challenges to processing huge amounts of data. To handle issues based on large-scale databases, a MapReduce framework is employed which provides robust and simple infrastructure for huge datasets. This paper proposes a novel Elastic collision seeker optimization based Faster R-CNN (ECSO-FRCNN) classifier for efficient big data classification. The proposed ECSO-FRCNN classifier is capable of handling missing attributes, and incremental learning and improves training performance effectively. As the proposed technique deals with large data samples, it necessitates the inclusion of the MapReduce framework. The adaption of MapReduce design in big data classification prevents the classification results from uncertainties such as data redundancy, misclassification, and storage issues. The proposed method is examined with three standard datasets, namely the skin segmentation dataset, mushroom dataset, and localization dataset, collected from the University of California, UCI machine learning repository. Finally, extensive experimental analysis is carried out for various parameters to depict the efficiency of the system.

AB The new area of Learned Data Structures consists of mixing Machine Learning techniques with those specific to Data Structures, with the purpose to achieve time/space gains in the performance of those latter. The perceived paradigm shift in computer architectures, that would favor the employment of graphics/tensor units over traditional central processing units, is one of the driving forces behind this new area. The advent of the corresponding branch-free programming paradigm would then favor the adoption of Neural Networks as the fundamental units of Classic Data Structures. This is the case of Learned Bloom Filters. The equally important field of Learned Indexes does not appear to make use of Neural Networks at all. In this paper, we offer a comparative experimental investigation regarding the potential uses of Neural Networks as a fundamental building block of Learned Indexes. Our results provide a solid and much-needed evaluation of the role Neural Networks can play in Learned Indexing. Based on our findings, we highlight the need for the creation of highly specialised Neural Networks customised to Learned Indexes. Because of the methodological significance of our findings and application of Learned Indexes in strategic domains, such as Computer Networks and Databases, care has been taken to make the presentation of our results accessible to the general audience of scientists and engineers working in Neural Networks and with no background about Learned Indexing.

AB Permutation flow-shop scheduling problems with many objectives have wide applications in the modern manufacturing domain such as the printed circuit board (PCB) industry. In this paper, an upgraded method called reinforcement cumulative prospect theory is proposed for solving many-objective permutation flow-shop scheduling problems. Reinforcement cumulative prospect theory is determined by two reference points, the improved prospect value function, and the entropy-based decision weight function. A novel many-objective optimization algorithm, namely, an optimal foraging algorithm based on the reinforcement cumulative prospect theory (OFA/RCPT), is presented. The comprehensive prospect value is used as the fitness strategy of the OFA/RCPT algorithm to guide the optimization process. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed by a comparison with nine state-of-the-art algorithms. Three classification experiments are carried out on six Walking-Fish-Group test cases, seven permutation flow-shop scheduling benchmark instances, and a practical permutation flow-shop scheduling problem in low-volume PCB manufacturing. For the experiment, four performance metrics are adopted, and the commercial software Quest is used to simulate a PCB production line. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the other algorithms.

AB This paper deals with self-adaptive real-time embedded systems (RTES). A self-adaptive system can operate in different modes. Each mode encodes a set of real-time tasks. To be executed, each task is allocated to a processor (placement) and assigned a priority (scheduling), while respecting timing constraints. An adaptation scenario allows switching between modes by adding, removing, and updating task parameters that must meet related deadlines after adaptation. For such systems, anticipating all operational modes at design time is usually impossible. Online reinforcement learning is increasingly used in the presence of design-time uncertainty. To tackle this problem, we formalize the placement and scheduling problems in self-adaptive RTES as a Markov decision process and propose related algorithms based on Q-learning. Then, we introduce an approach that integrates the proposed algorithms to assist designers in the development of self-adaptive RTES. At the design level, the RL Placement and the RL Scheduler are proposed to process predictable adaptation scenarios. These modules are designed to generate placement and scheduling models for an application while maximizing system extensibility and ensuring real-time feasibility. At the execution level, the RL Adapter is defined to process online adaptations. Indeed, the goal of the RL Adapter agent is to reject the adaptation scenario when feasibility concerns are raised; otherwise, it generates a new feasible placement and scheduling. We apply and simulate the proposed approach to a healthcare robot case study to show its applicability. Performance evaluations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to related works.

AB Sculptures and paintings are an important part of our cultural heritage, and 3D reconstruction of the human in them can help us better preserve and inherit this heritage. By creating 3D models of sculptures and paintings, these artworks become more accessible to a wider audience. This allows more people to appreciate and learn about different cultures and their heritage. 3D human reconstruction based on Transformer structures has recently achieved state-of-the-art results, but this approach requires a large number of parameters and expensive computations. The neglected computational complexity and the size of the model make it difficult to use such models for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight method based on human body joints and Transformer, called JointMETRO (Joint MEsh TRansfOrmer). It reconstructs the human body mesh from 2D human joints and has better capability to reconstruct characters in artistic works. We propose a joint extraction module, which obtains the locations of the 13 human joint points and the confidence coefficient of each joint, and a mesh regression module, which is used to combine the extracted pose features with a mesh template to obtain the final reconstructed human mesh structure. Finally, the accuracy of the reconstructed human model can be seen visually by applying different colors to the mesh vertices based on the confidence coefficient of each joint. We have demonstrated the efficiency of the model through extensive evaluation on both the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. On the complex in-the-wild 3DPW dataset, JointMETRO achieved better accuracy than the pose-based SOTA method.

AB The problem of adaptive arbitrary convergence time terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) for nonlinear networked systems with completely unknown functions and nonresponsive UDP stream disturbances is studied. In this work, an improved sliding surface based on arbitrary convergence time is designed to overcome the issue that the convergence rate depends on the system state. Different from the traditional TSMC, this paper introduces holistically an auxiliary term (nonautonomous differential equation) into the design of a sliding mode controller, which can compensate for the influence of neural adaptive approximation error and ensure the convergence of a closed-loop system at prescribed time. A robust compensation signal is also constructed by introducing a super twisting disturbance observer to process nonresponsive UDP flows. In addition, the controller is designed in a piecewise continuous manner, so that the sliding mode surface can be selected arbitrarily, according to the adaptation after the prescribed time. The effectiveness of the new controller is verified by extensive simulations in comparison with related works.

AB Predefined-time stability contributes to constraining the tracking time of robotic manipulators, but the stringent judgment conditions restrict its practical application. This paper studies an adaptive practical predefined-time neural control scheme for uncertain multi-joint robotic manipulators with input saturation. First, a practical predefined-time stability criterion is established to ensure the closed-loop stability of uncertain systems. Then, the unknown robotic dynamic model can be approximated by radial basis function neural networks. Meanwhile, the input saturation of the robotic manipulator is compensated by introducing an adaptive term. Based on the constructed stability criterion, the proposed controller is proved to guarantee that the tracking error of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a predefined time and is independent of the initial state. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is emphasized by numerical simulations and experiments of a two-joint and a nine-joint robotic manipulator, respectively.

ID PREDICTION
AB The canonical technique for nonlinear modeling of spatial/point-referenced data is known as kriging in geostatistics, and as Gaussian Process (GP) regression for surrogate modeling and statistical learning. This article reviews many similarities shared between kriging and GPs, but also highlights some important differences. One is that GPs impose a process that can be used to automate kernel/variogram inference, thus removing the human from the loop. The GP framework also suggests a probabilistically valid means of scaling to handle a large corpus of training data, that is, an alternative to ordinary kriging. Finally, recent GP implementations are tailored to make the most of modern computing architectures, such as multi-core workstations and multi-node supercomputers. We argue that such distinctions are important even in classically geostatistical settings. To back that up, we present out-of-sample validation exercises using two, real, large-scale borehole data sets acquired in the mining of gold and other minerals. We compare classic kriging with several variations of modern GPs and conclude that the latter is more economical (fewer human and compute resources), more accurate and offers better uncertainty quantification. We go on to show how the fully generative modeling apparatus provided by GPs can gracefully accommodate left-censoring of small measurements, as commonly occurs in mining data and other borehole assays.

AB In this paper, an optimal bounded robust control algorithm for secure autonomous navigation in quadcopter vehicles is proposed. The controller is developed combining two parts; one dedicated to stabilize the closed-loop system and the second one for dealing and estimating external disturbances as well unknown nonlinearities inherent to the real system's operations. For bounding the energy used by the system during a mission and, without losing its robustness properties, the quadratic problem formulation is used considering the actuators system constraints. The resulting optimal bounded control scheme improves considerably the stability and robustness of the closed-loop system and at the same time bounds the motor control inputs. The controller is validated in real-time flights and in unconventional conditions for high wind-gusts and Loss of Effectiveness in two rotors. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller in both scenarios.

AB Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among adults. Although its triggers are still not clear, they may be due to a combination of different types of biomarkers measured through medical imaging, metabolomics, proteomics or genetics, among others. In this context, we have proposed a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that combines structural and functional imaging data from subjects in Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset by means of an Ensemble Learning methodology trained to identify and penalize input sources with low classification rates and/or high-variability. This proposal improves results published in recent years and provides an accurate solution not only from the point of view of image preprocessing (including a comparison between different intensity preservation techniques), but also in terms of dimensionality reduction methods (Isomap). In addition, we have also introduced a bagging classification schema for scenarios with unbalanced data.As shown by our results, the CAD proposal is able to detect PD with 96.48% of balanced accuracy, and opens up the possibility of combining any number of input data sources relevant for PD.

ID WEB SERVICES
AB SOA is an architectural style that enables providing applications as services. Following the authentication procedure, most Web services-based applications use application-specific access control mechanisms to make authorization decisions. Services can interact with one another, sometimes relying on a trust-based relationship. However, if unauthorized access is gained to a particular service, it could potentially jeopardize the whole security system. REST, likewise, is an architectural style defined by a set of principles for creating network-based software structures. These concepts come together to form a coherent metaphor for the Web's processes and interactions. In RESTful services, authentication and authorization play a tremendous role in terms of security, so services are constantly charged with authenticating users. Security as an essential aspect of services affects those servers necessarily containing the authentication mechanism, and they must authenticate each service for each of its requests. This study presents the mechanisms of authentication and authorization in RESTful services. A RESTful service's authorization management framework is proposed and the possibility to manage service access authorization to specific services (resources) is described and implemented. The paper is concluded with the presentation of experimental results derived from the implementation of the REST services based on the proposed framework.

ID DESIGN
AB Multimedia applications, such as image processing including image and video transfer, heavily rely on reduction. The traditional device methods to picture reduction use more space, energy, and processing time. The majority of current efforts use the Golomb-Rice encoding, due to its larger memory requirement and higher computing difficulty. So, this research concentrated on hardware design-oriented probability run length (PRL) coding technique based on lossless colour image compression. The block truncation coding (BTC) features of the compression process are used by the suggested PRL method. The proposed image compression hardware consists of various modules such as a Parameter calculator, fuzzy table, bitmap generator, BTC parameters training, prediction, and error control, and PRL-based finite state machine (PRL-FSM). The proposed image compressor utilizes the parameter calculator block, which estimates the block type based on the image pixel intensities for each sub-block. Thus, each block of the image is compressed by using a new block type and generates a variable block size. The proposed method utilizes the PRL-BTC encoding method, which also calculates the probability of error between the compressed image to the test image. The process is iterated until the performance trade-off between hardware cost and compression ratio (CR) is achieved. Hence, both smooth regions and non-smooth regions of images are perfectly compressed by the probability-based block selection. The simulation results show that the proposed method resulted in a better area, power, delay metrics, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and CR compared to the state of art approaches.

TI Boosting for regression transfer via importance sampling

DT Article; Early Access
DE Instance transfer learning; Negative transfer; Domain adaptation
ID COMPLEXITY; FEATURES
AB Current instance transfer learning (ITL) methodologies use domain adaptation and sub-space transformation to achieve successful transfer learning. However, these methodologies, in their processes, sometimes overfit on the target dataset or suffer from negative transfer if the test dataset has a high variance. Boosting methodologies have been shown to reduce the risk of overfitting by iteratively re-weighing instances with high-residual. However, this balance is usually achieved with parameter optimization, as well as reducing the skewness in weights produced due to the size of the source dataset. While the former can be achieved, the latter is more challenging and can lead to negative transfer. We introduce a simpler and more robust fix to this problem by building upon the popular boosting ITL regression methodology, two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2. Our methodology, S-TrAdaBoost.R2, is a boosting-based ensemble methodology that utilizes importance sampling to reduce the skewness due to the source dataset. We show that S-TrAdaBoost.R2 performs better than competitive transfer learning methodologies 63% of the time. It also displays consistency in its performance over diverse datasets with varying complexities, as opposed to the sporadic results observed for other transfer learning methodologies.

TI RAMFAE: a novel unsupervised visual anomaly detection method based on

AB Traditional methods of visual anomaly detection based on reconstruction often use normal data to train autoencoder. Then the metric distance detection method is used to estimate whether the samples of detection belong to the exception class. However, this method has some problems that the autoencoder produces blurry images to cause false detection of normal pixel points. The model may still be able to fully reconstruct the undiscovered defects due to the large capacity of autoencoder, even if it is trained only on normal samples. Then, the metric distance detection method would ignore local key information. To solve this problem, this paper comes up with the random anomaly multi-scale feature focused autoencoder (RAMFAE), an innovative unsupervised visual anomaly detection technique, which incorporates three novel concepts. First, a multi-scale feature focused extraction (MFFE) network structure is designed and added between the encoder and decoder, which effectively solves the problem of reconstructing image blur and effectively improves the sensitivity of the model to normal regions. Second, this article employs Delete Paste, a novel data augmentation strategy for generating two different types of random anomalies, which pastes the cut part into a random location, while the pixels in the original position are filled with 0. In spite of the input anomalous images, the strategy makes the model be able to produce normal images to avoid the phenomenon of anomaly reconstruction, and then enables defect localization based on the error between the measured image and the reconstructed image. Third, the study adopts the image quality assessment with combining gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD) and structural similarity (SSIM) to solve the problem that local key information and texture detail information are not easy to be paid attention to by the model, and alleviate the training pressure caused by Delete Paste enhancement. We perform an extensive evaluation on the challenging MVTec AD data set and compare it with the advanced visual anomaly detection methods in recent years as well. The AUC final result of RAMFAE in this text reaches 94.5, which is 3.6, 2.5 and 0.8 higher than the advanced IGD, FCDD and RIAD detection methods.

AB Due to the huge cost of manual annotations, the labelled data may not be sufficient to train a dynamic facial expression (DFR) recogniser with good performance. To address this, the authors propose a multi-modal pre-training method with a pseudo-label guidance mechanism to make full use of unlabelled video data for learning informative representations of facial expressions. First, the authors build a pre-training dataset of videos with aligned vision and audio modals. Second, the vision and audio feature encoders are trained through an instance discrimination strategy and a cross-modal alignment strategy on the pre-training data. Third, the vision feature encoder is extended as a dynamic expression recogniser and is fine-tuned on the labelled training data. Fourth, the fine-tuned expression recogniser is adopted to predict pseudo-labels for the pre-training data, and then start a new pre-training phase with the guidance of pseudo-labels to alleviate the long-tail distribution problem and the instance-class confliction. Fifth, since the representations learnt with the guidance of pseudo-labels are more informative, a new fine-tuning phase is added to further boost the generalisation performance on the DFR recognition task. Experimental results on the Dynamic Facial Expression in the Wild dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

AB The paper explores the vulnerability of a popular deep learning model-recurrent graph convolutional network (RGCN)-from the view of model extraction attacks. As a commonly-used attack method, graph-based active learning strategies could perform black-box model extraction attacks for extracting high-fidelity deep learning models without the background knowledge of model structure and parameters. They still have two limitations-spatial-temporal information ignorance and lack of cost-effective node sampling constraints-on dynamic graphs, influencing the fidelity of extracted RGCN models. In this paper, the proposed multiple-model and time-sensitive dynamic active learning (MTDAL) strategy relied on an RGCN committee to solve the spatial-temporal information ignorance. It captures the time-sensitive dynamic node importance from dynamic node representatives and dynamic node informativeness. In the node sampling procedure, the dynamic node representative is measured by the time-sensitive and weighted distance between node embeddings and associated cluster centers achieved by semi-supervised clustering. The dynamic node informativeness is measured by the spatial-temporal disagreement of node embeddings output by the RGCN committee that includes RGCNs with multiple model structures. To overcome cost-effective node sampling difficulties, MTDAL configures the class-balance constraints and makes a trade-off between aggregated dynamic node importance and standardized nonequivalent node query cost. In the experiments, graph-based active learning strategies achieve node sampling for querying different-type oracle models and exploit labeled nodes for training multiple RGCN models in the RGCN committee. Compared with random, KcenterGreedy, and ALDG strategies, the proposed MTDAL strategy could effectively sample the most critical dynamic nodes for extracting higher-fidelity RGCN models, especially in dynamic node classification tasks.

AB Electricity as a source of energy, is one of the most essential part in our life. In recent time, it is noted that the temperature of earth increases in compare to the previous years. It is caused due to burning of the conventional energy sources such as gas, oil, and coal from thermal power plant and other sources, which brings about global warming. Bases on this fact, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model to design an electric sustainable supply chain network by considering resiliency and responsiveness. In order to formulate the environmental issues, a power-to-gas (P2G) technology is considered as an environment-friendly system. The presence of P2G can reduce the carbon level and it has some major advantages, i.e., it collects carbon dioxide (CO2) from thermal power plant and then converts CO2 to hydrogen (H-2) with the help of water (H2O) and methane (CH4) gas. The drawbacks in addressing the uncertainty of the parameters are overcome by proposing a novel fuzzy robust flexible programming approach based on Me measure. Thereafter, a new approach namely, multi-choice conic goal programming with utility function is introduced to solve the proposed multi-objective model. Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) in India is considered as a case study about electric network that envisages the sustainable issues of an electric supply chain. Finally, experimental results show that one bio-fuel plant, one photovoltaic plant, one air turbine plant, and two mixed-cycle power plants are build at the end of the scheduled period.

AB Information decompositions quantify how the Shannon information about a given random variable is distributed among several other random variables. Various requirements have been proposed that such a decomposition should satisfy, leading to different candidate solutions. Curiously, however, only two of the original requirements that determined the Shannon information have been considered, namely monotonicity and normalization. Two other important properties, continuity and additivity, have not been considered. In this contribution, we focus on the mutual information of two finite variables Y, Z about a third finite variable S and check which of the decompositions satisfy these two properties. While most of them satisfy continuity, only one of them is both continuous and additive. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper faces this issue by introducing a Data-aware Explainable Next Activity Prediction approach called DENAP based on the adoption of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method for the detection of next activity prediction in a business process and for the evaluation of the past activities and data that influence the prediction. The DENAP approach is validated on a set of synthetic and real logs. The obtained results show the good capability of DENAP to predict the next activity and indicate the more relevant activities/data with respect to the prediction.

AB This research proposes a novel approach for the robust optimization of the design of hydrogen peroxide propulsion control systems using the efficient and advanced Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) method. This study adopts a robust design optimization (RDO) formulation that considers both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties, including sparse points and interval data, and uses the Johnson distribution family for uncertainty representation. The maximum likelihood estimation method is applied to determine the distribution parameters, also considering interval data with a nested optimization technique. A novel advanced TLBO method with high accuracy and convergence rate is employed to optimization of this robust design approach. The method's originality and advancement come from two categories of modifications to the original framework: the structure of the teaching and learning phases and the initialization and search approach. The efficacy and applicability of the proposed Ad-TLBO, respectively, were evaluated using benchmark problems from the CEC2020 competition and three real-world engineering problems, with a comparison to some recently published and the CEC competition's top-ranked algorithms. The results and statistical analyses of the Quade test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Friedman test show that the proposed Ad-TLBO method outperforms the other algorithms. The proposed optimization method is eventually applied to design a monopropellant propulsion system as the control actuator of a satellite orbital transfer system. It is found that the proposed advanced TLBO is effective in handling uncertainty in real design problems and improves both the convergence rate and accuracy of the optimization process.

ID MODEL
AB Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring maritime traffic safety and efficiency, particularly in precaution areas characterized by multi-waterway branch merging and frequent traffic conflicts. However, predicting trajectories in these areas poses significant challenges due to the uncertain future intents of different directional branches resulting in diverse motion patterns and multiple possible paths. To address this issue and minimize the prediction error, we propose a conditional temporal generative adversarial network (CTGAN). Specifically, in this method, the trajectory generator is developed to capture the inherently dynamic of ship motions and outputs the future trajectory proposals, while the intent classifier is designed to evaluate whether the trajectory proposals are consistent with the hidden intention. With the adversarial training strategy, the trajectory generator and intent classifier form a closed loop, feedback informative signals to each other that enables generating the intent-constrained trajectory. In addition, a mixed adversarial loss function was designed to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among the vessel motions for producing consistent trajectories that complied with plausible ship dynamics. Experiments on extensive naturalistic vessel trajectory data demonstrate that compared with the baseline methods, the proposed model achieves comparable or better prediction performance.

AB The efficacious application of fuzzy-based systems largely depends on some parameters of subjective decisions, e.g., fuzzy membership functions (MFs). The second-order fuzzy-based system with decoupling technique, which is generally a multi-inputs single-output (MISO) system executing augmented output MFs, is introduced to enhance the fuzzy system's precision, heftiness, and recital. The best suitable protocol for input and output MFs is presented to design the input and output MFs in the discourse. The results of the uniformed and augmented designed output MFs are compared in identical circumstances. The experimental results and simulation results are in virtuous agreement. By applying the proposed method to different fuzzy systems, the mean absolute error (MAE) was reduced 82%, and the relative error was decreased to an adequate (& LE; & PLUSMN;10%) range. The control precision is enhanced, and the heftiness is improved by reducing the MAE through the proposed second-order fuzzy model. Furthermore, the energy and cost efficacy of the proposed second-order fuzzy model will be highly enhanced by applying the augmented output MFs.

AB In this paper, an adaptive prescribed settling time periodic event-triggered control (APST-PETC) is investigated for uncertain robotic manipulators with state constraints. In order to economize network bandwidth occupancy and reduce computational burden, a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) strategy is proposed to reduce the update frequency of the control signal and avoid unnecessary continuous monitoring. Besides, considering that the maneuverable space of the actual robotic ma-nipulators is often limited, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is applied to deal with the influence of the constraint characteristics on the robotic manipulators. Further, based on the one-to-one nonlinear mapping function of the system tracking error, an adaptive prescribed settling time control (APSTC) is designed to ensure that the system tracking error reaches the predetermined precision residual set within the prescribed settling time. Finally, theoretical analysis and comparative experiments are given to verify its feasibility. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shadows observed in practical scenes have complex shapes, and removing them is a very challenging task in computer vision. In particular, previous studies on complex shadow removal have limitations in that they can be learned only on paired datasets. Taking the issues into consideration, we present a new domain-adaptive shadow removal framework. The proposed approach includes domain adaptation, detection, and removal stages. The shadow-preserving domain translator in the first stage compensates for the lack of real data through domain transformation of the synthetic data. In the second stage, efficient shadow detection is performed through the domain adaptive mean teacher network. Last, a novel attention network removes complex shadows using detected shadows as a query, effectively removing complex shadows. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are validated through the newly collected Grand Theft Auto-Road Shadow dataset. The proposed method outperforms existing methods for quantitative and qualitative metrics related to shadow detection and removal.

AB This work proposes a solution to improve transfer learning from laboratory environment to real-world hydraulic machinery (centrifugal pump) for the effective identification of defects. The proposed method involves collecting vibration data, normalizing and computing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the data, and adding attributes by combining the FFT of healthy real-world machinery with the FFT of laboratory machinery. The attribute addition is performed in the frequency domain to address phase lag issues in time-domain data. The resulting signal is transformed back to the time domain, and the envelope spectrum is obtained. An approximation model is constructed using the envelope spectrum and refined using data from industrial machinery. The refined model is then employed to identify defects in real machinery, specifically the centrifugal pump. The proposed knowledge addition-based transfer learning achieves an accuracy of 93%, which is 51% higher than the accuracy attained by the domain-adversarial neural network method.

AB Self-distillation has gained widespread attention in recent years because it progressively transfers the knowl-edge in end-to-end training schemes within one network. However, self-distillation methods are susceptible to label noise hence leading to poor generalization performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel self-distillation method, called GEIKD, which combines a gated ensemble self-teacher network and the influences-based label noise removal. Specifically, we design a gated ensemble self-teacher network composed of multiple teacher branches, which allows a gated fused knowledge based on a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network. Moreover, we introduce influences estimation into the distillation process to quantify the effect of noisy labels on the distillation loss, and then reject the unfavorable instances as noisy labeled samples according to the calculated influences. Our influences-based label noise removal can be integrated with any existing knowledge distillation training schemes. The impact of noisy labels on knowledge distillation can be significantly alleviated by the proposed noisy instances removal with little extra training efforts. Experiments show that the proposed GEIKD method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, TinyimageNet and fine-grained datasets CUB200, MIT-67, Stanford40 and FERC dataset, using clean data and data with noisy labels.

AB Humanaction recognition based on still images is one of themost challenging computer vision tasks. In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have developed rapidly and achieved good performance in human action recognition tasks based on still images. Due to the absence of the remote perception ability of CNNs, it is challenging to have a global structural understanding of human behavior and the overall relationship between the behavior and the environment. Recently, transformer-based models have been making a splash in computer vision, even reaching SOTA in several vision tasks. We explore the transformer's capability in human action recognition based on still images and add a simple but effective feature fusion module based on the Swin-Transformer model. More specifically, we propose a newtransformer-basedmodel for behavioral feature extraction that uses a pre-trained SwinTransformer as the backbone network. Swin-Transformer's distinctive hierarchical structure, combined with the feature fusion module, is used to extract and fuse multi-scale behavioral information. Extensive experiments were conducted on five still image-based human action recognition datasets, including the Li's action dataset, the Stanford-40 dataset, the PPMI-24 dataset, the AUC-V1 dataset, and the AUC-V2 dataset. Results indicate that our proposed Swin-Fusion model achieves better behavior recognition than previously improved CNNbased models by sharing and reusing feature maps of different scales at multiple stages, without modifying the original backbone training method and with only increasing training resources by 1.6%. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ cts4444/ Swin-Fusion.

AB Since 2019, COVID disease threats the world. It originated in China, and due to its easy spread characteristics, it spreads quickly among all the countries. As the world faced a new kind of virus, the government could not control its spread, and the fatality rate had also hugely increased. In 2021, the vaccine for the virus was introduced by various countries, which aids in controlling the spread and mortality rate. The mutant form of this virus exhibits high efficiency. So, this study analyzes the effective of COVID vaccines released after 2020 against all COVID variants through the fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (SIR) decision-making method. The vaccines and variants are analyzed by the m x n matrix pattern under the fuzzy SIR-integrated weight method. The disease variants are taken as criteria and that are assigned integrated weight based on subjective, objective weight approaches. The intuitionistic fuzzy set-double parameter (IFSDP) handles the vagueness by strictly including only membership and non-membership functions with the condition 0 <= mu*(x) + v*(x) <= 1. As a result, the vaccines Moderna and Covishield are attained top rank and have a high likelihood to combat all the COVID variants compared to other vaccines. The reached outcomes are corroborated through sensitivity and comparative analysis. The sensitivity and comparative studies are measured by increasing the order of IFS-DP and extant fuzzy MCDM methods, respectively. The comparison of these results with those obtained from the proposed method is similar to the sensitivity study, along with minor variations observed in the comparative study. Therefore, the proposed method generates an efficient outcome. Moreover, the testing hypothesis technique is applied to check the efficiency of proposed method.

AB With Company2Vec, the paper proposes a novel application in representation learning. The model analyzes business activities from unstructured company website data using Word2Vec and dimensionality reduction. Company2Vec maintains semantic language structures and thus creates efficient company embeddings in fine-granular industries. These semantic embeddings can be used for various applications in banking.Direct relations between companies and words allow semantic business analytics (e.g., top-n words for a company). Furthermore, industry prediction is presented as a supervised learning application and evaluation method. The vectorized structure of the embeddings allows measuring companies' similarities with the cosine distance. Company2Vec hence offers a more fine-grained comparison of companies than the standard industry labels (NACE). This property is relevant for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering. An alternative industry segmentation is shown with k-means clustering on the company embeddings. Finally, this paper proposes three algorithms for (1) firm-centric, (2) industry-centric and (3) portfolio-centric peer-firm identification.

AB Intuitively, experience playing against one mixture of opponents in a given domain should be relevant for a different mixture in the same domain. If the mixture changes, ideally we would not have to train from scratch, but rather could transfer what we have learned to construct a policy to play against the new mixture. We propose a transfer learning method, Q-Mixing, that starts by learning Q-values against each pure-strategy opponent. Then a Q-value for any distribution of opponent strategies is approximated by appropriately averaging the separately learned Q-values. From these components, we construct policies against all opponent mixtures without any further training. We empirically validate Q-Mixing in two environments: a simple grid-world soccer environment, and a social dilemma game. Our experiments find that Q-Mixing can successfully transfer knowledge across any mixture of opponents. Next, we consider the use of observations during play to update the believed distribution of opponents. We introduce an opponent policy classifier-trained reusing Q-learning data-and use the classifier results to refine the mixing of Q-values. Q-Mixing augmented with the opponent policy classifier performs better, with higher variance, than training directly against a mixed-strategy opponent.

AB There is growing expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) developers foresee and mitigate harms that might result from their creations; however, this is exceptionally difficult given the prevalence of emergent behaviors that occur when integrating AI into complex sociotechnical systems. We argue that Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) principles, models, and tools are well-suited to tackling this challenge. Already applied in high-consequence domains, NDM tools such as the premortem, and others, have been shown to uncover a reasonable set of risks of underlying factors that would lead to ethical harms. Such NDM tools have already been used to develop AI that is more trustworthy and resilient, and can help avoid unintended consequences of AI built with noble intentions. We present predictive policing algorithms as a use case, highlighting various factors that led to ethical harms and how NDM tools could help foresee and mitigate such harms.

AB This article studies the leader-following formation tracking control problem of multiple vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to uncertain parameters, in which the target formation configuration is defined by using the interneighbors' bearing vectors. An adaptive formation control algorithm with bearing-only measurements is proposed under a hierarchical control framework. More specifically, a saturated adaptive distributed control force is developed in the position loop with bearing-only measurements. Since the bearing vectors with respect to the neighbors can be directly measured by low-cost onboard cameras, the proposed formation algorithm can be implemented without interagent communication. Subsequently, in the attitude loop, an adaptive hybrid control scheme via two modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) sets is proposed, which achieves the command attitude tracking globally and also avoids the unwinding problem of MRPs. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis and hybrid theory, we prove that the overall closed-loop error system is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, we provide a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Inertial sensors are widely used to measure human movement. Although inertial sensors have been successfully applied to exergaming in the past, the problem of detecting foot motions to interact with stepping exergames is still largely understudied. In this work, we developed a new method to detect and classify step directions relying on inertial sensor data captured by two shoe-mounted inertial sensors. Drawing on previous results, we developed a single multiclass classifier to distinguish front, back, side, and center steps originating from any of these positions. Since some of these steps exhibit similar displacement patterns, the previous step position was also considered as an input to the classifier. The method was tested on a group of young and older adults, achieving an accuracy of 93.1%. Performance remained consistent throughout the acquisition time due to the introduction of a novel calibration approach designed to handle sensor orientation drift over time. This study provided the first insights into the potential of inertial sensors to detect the foot motions required to interact with stepping exergames. Experimental results support their application in a real scenario.

AB This paper aims to propose a new technique for identifying and categorizing malevolent Internet traffic within the context of security for smart devices. Given the rising usage of smart devices, including mobile phones, wearables, smart transportation-based devices, and the Internet of Things, concerns regarding their security are increasing. The need to develop effective security measures arises from the potential for attackers to compromise user data. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), with long short-term memory (LSTM) for the purpose of detecting and categorizing malevolent Internet traffic. The objective of the proposed technique is to address the challenges related to time estimation by focusing on level prediction, resulting in a substantial reduction in prediction time for the identification of malevolent traffic. We utilize bidirectional long short-term memory-CNN (BI-LSTM-CNN) to identify malevolent communication and provide support for voice input. Experimental outcomes illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in terms of precision, accuracy, F1 factor, false acceptance rate (FAR), false positive rate (FPR), and detection rate. In comparison with existing methods for detecting malevolent traffic, our approach achieves a 99.62% traffic detection rate, 99.98% accuracy, and 0.01% FAR, whereas the accuracy, detection rate of malevolent traffic, and FAR of existing methods are 99.88%, 97.32%, and 4.31%, respectively. These outcomes emphasize the superior performance and analysis of our technique, rendering it a valuable contribution to the realm of smart device security. In summary, this paper proposes a novel BI-LSTM-CNN technique for detecting malevolent traffic in smart devices. The proposed methodology tackles time estimation challenges and exhibits superior performance when compared to existing techniques.

AB Multimodal transportation systems require an effective journey planner to allocate multiple passengers to transport operators. One example is mobility-as-a-service, a new mobility service that integrates various transport modes through a single platform. In such a multimodal and diverse journey planning problem, accommodating heterogeneous passengers with different and dynamic preferences can be challenging. Furthermore, passengers may behave based on experiences and expectations, in the sense that the transport experience affects their state and decision of the next transport service. Current methods of treating each journey planning optimization as a non-time varying single experience problem cannot adequately model passenger experience and memories over many journeys over time. In this paper, we model passenger experience as a Markov model where prior experiences have a transient effect on future long-term satisfaction and retention rate. As such, we formulate a multi-objective journey planning problem that considers individual passenger preferences, experiences, and memories. The proposed approach dynamically determines utility weights to obtain an optimal journey plan for individual passengers based on their status. To balance the profit received by each transport operator, we present a variant-based proportional fairness. Our experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets show that our approach enhances passenger satisfaction, compared to baseline methods. We demonstrate that the overall profit is increased by 2.3 times, resulting in a higher retention rate caused by higher satisfaction levels. Our proposed approach can facilitate the participation of transport operators and promote passenger acceptance of MaaS.

AB We analyze algorithmic and computational aspects of biological phenomena, such as replication and programmed death, in the context of machine learning. We use two different measures of neuron efficiency to develop machine learning algorithms for adding neurons to the system (i.e., replication algorithm) and removing neurons from the system (i.e., programmed death algorithm). We argue that the programmed death algorithm can be used for compression of neural networks and the replication algorithm can be used for improving performance of the already trained neural networks. We also show that a combined algorithm of programmed death and replication can improve the learning efficiency of arbitrary machine learning systems. The computational advantages of the bio-inspired algorithms are demonstrated by training feedforward neural networks on the MNIST dataset of handwritten images.

AB Government incentives play an important role in the development of the remanufacturing industry. It remains a challenge to determine an optimal policy (subsidy and/or tax refund) and how firms (manufacturers and retailers) can integrate it into their pricing decisions. We analyze the impacts of government financial incentives on manufacturers' and retailers' pricing decisions in terms of corporate profits and social welfare under different scenarios. We find that government incentives increase the recycling price and availability of used products, while the wholesale and retail prices of new products remain unchanged. Government incentives also significantly increase the manufacturer's profits and enhance social welfare.

ID HYBRID STRUCTURE DESCRIPTOR; CLASSIFICATION
AB Osteosarcoma has the highest incidence rate among malignant bone tumours. It is particularly detrimental to human health because it is a highly malignant tumour. Also makes up 40% of initial malignant bone tumours while having a 3-10 per million incidences. High mortality and morbidity rates are associated with osteosarcoma, particularly in underdeveloped nations. To increase patient survival, early osteosarcoma screening and diagnosis are essential. In this study, we suggest a novel encoder-decoder method that associations nested connections and an effective attention mechanism. The encoder, decoder, and skip connection make up the model's structure. The DropBlock regularization technique makes it easier to discard local semantic information while still encouraging the network to learn resilient and useful features. An effective attention module leverages the right kind of cross-channel contact to collect more detailed global data. In the skip connection section, the semantic gap left by a direct simple connection is filled by using the nested connection method to combine the feature maps obtained from the intermediate decoder with the original feature maps from the encoder. The original image is then enhanced with data to increase robustness and avoid the over-fitting issue brought on by insufficient data. Three separate data sets and a variety of performance indicators are used to examine the robustness of the proposed model. The suggested model outperforms other current models thanks to its strong performance, achieving an average accuracy of 99.13%. Here, Datasets 1, 2, and 3 each have an accuracy of 99.67%, 98.16%, and 99.76%, respectively. The investigational results show that our proposed method can significantly progress the presence of convolutional neural networks and state-of-the-art methods.

DT Article; Early Access

   structure
AB Partial label learning (PLL) is an essential weakly supervised learning method. In PLL, the example's ground-truth label is unknown and hidden in a candidate label set comprising a subset of the label set. A multi-classifier is trained through a set of examples and candidate labels. The obscurity of the candidate label set makes the PLL challenging. Although high-efficiency graph-based methods without any parameters have been proposed to disambiguate, it is challenging to adapt a single graph structure for various actual data. The current work presents a new multi-graph embedding collaborative disambiguation PLL algorithm (PL-MGECD) to address the mentioned problem. The contributions of the current work are: (1) A unified framework for graph-based PLL is presented for the first time, which combines a least squares regression loss and a graph regularization term with ambiguous label constraints. (2) PL-MGECD adopts various graph structures in partial label learning for the first time and compensates for the lack of single graph representation data by fusing the complementarity of different graph structures. (3) PL-MGECD first introduces a graph structure constructed by candidate label information and employs the candidate tag information to modify the graph structure to compensate for the label disambiguation shortage through feature spatial similarity. (4) An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PL-MGECD method has a competitive or superior performance over some traditional PLL methods.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS

DE Recommender systems; Visual summaries; Deep learning; Clustering
AB Navigation through large volumes of images is a complex and tedious task that requires tools to facilitate the exploration and discovery of visual information. Photo summaries are one of these tools, which consist of selecting a reduced set of images that best represent the original data source. However, creating photo summaries in the context of recommender systems poses several challenges: How to select the most relevant images for each item? How to encode each image? How to evaluate the quality of the generated summary? In this manuscript, we propose a clustering-based method to create a visual summary in the context of a restaurant recommender system, which includes the photos taken by users who visited the restaurants (items) in a given city. These photos are encoded using a deep neural network that takes into account not only their content but also the relationships between users and restaurants. This encoding will allow us to create a visual summary that captures the essence of user tastes and illustrates the gastronomic offer of the city. We also propose a similarity measure between items based on the users who have visited them and an evaluation method that calculates to what extent the summary obtained represents the original data source. The experimentation carried out includes five datasets and the obtained results demonstrate the adequacy of our proposal for the construction of these summaries.

AB This article discusses a novel type-2 fuzzy inference system with multiple variables in which no fuzzy rules are explicitly defined. By using a rule-free system, we avoid the serious disadvantage of rule-based systems, which are burdened with the curse of dimensionality. In the proposed system, Gaussian membership functions are used for its inputs, and linearly parameterized system functions are used to obtain its output. To obtain the system parameters, a genetic algorithm with multi-objective function is applied. In the presented method, the genetic algorithm is combined with a feature selection method and a regularized ridge regression. The objective functions consist of a pair in which one function is defined as the number of active features and the other as the validation error for regression models or the accuracy for classification models. In this way, the models are selected from the Pareto front considering some compromise between their quality and simplification. Compared to the author's previous work on the regression-based fuzzy inference system, a new inference scheme with type-2 fuzzy sets has been proposed, and the quality has been improved compared to the system based on type-1 fuzzy sets. Four experiments involving the approximation of a function, the prediction of fuel consumption, the classification of breast tissue, and the prediction of concrete compressive strength confirmed the efficacy of the presented method.

AB In this paper, delayed impulsive control for fractional-order dynamic systems via event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is investigated, in which the impact of time delays in impulses is taken into account. Combining the novel event-triggering function into the transformed fractional-order delayed impulsive control system, the event-triggered impulsive sequence is generated. Under the frame of event-based delayed impulsive control (EDIC) technique, system signals are only allowed to be transmitted at discrete instants, while no additional control input is required for two successive impulsive instants. Then, the positive quantity of inter-execution is proved, which can exclude the Zeno behavior. Furthermore, the relationship is discussed among delayed impulsive functions, event-triggering parameters, and the order of controlled fractional-order systems. Compared with traditional time-triggered mechanism where the impulsive instants are required to be set in advance, EDIC can be viewed as a more flexible impulsive control since it makes impulsive control only activate when designed events occur, effectively improving the control efficiency. The simulation results are provided to verified the effectiveness of the proposed method at the end of this paper.

AB Background. One of the key elements in maintaining the consistent marketing of tomato fruit is tomato quality. Since ripeness is the most important factor for tomato quality in the viewpoint of consumers, determining the stages of tomato ripeness is a fundamental industrial concern with regard to tomato production to obtain a high quality product. Since tomatoes are one of the most important crops in the world, automatic ripeness evaluation of tomatoes is a significant study topic as it may prove beneficial in ensuring an optimal production of high-quality product, increasing profitability. This article explores and categorises the various maturity/ripeness phases to propose an automated multi-class classification approach for tomato ripeness testing and evaluation. Methods. Object detection is the critical component in a wide variety of computer vision problems and applications such as manufacturing, agriculture, medicine, and autonomous driving. Due to the tomato fruits' complex identification background, texture disruption, and partial occlusion, the classic deep learning object detection approach (YOLO) has a poor rate of success in detecting tomato fruits. To figure out these issues, this article proposes an improved YOLOv5 tomato detection algorithm. The proposed algorithm CAM-YOLO uses YOLOv5 for feature extraction, target identification and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The CBAM is added to the CAM-YOLO to focus the model on improving accuracy. Finally, non -maximum suppression and distance intersection over union (DIoU) are applied to enhance the identification of overlapping objects in the image.Results. Several images from the dataset were chosen for testing to assess the model's performance, and the detection performance of the CAM-YOLO and standard YOLOv5 models under various conditions was compared. The experimental results affirms that CAM-YOLO algorithm is efficient in detecting the overlapped and small tomatoes with an average precision of 88.1%.

AB Many tasks generated by mobile user devices are computation-intensive and latency-sensitive, such as autonomous driving and video analysis. However, due to limited energy and computing capacity, a user device may not be able to complete its task within a given time, leading to a poor user experience. Mobile edge computing (MEC) can address this challenge by offloading tasks to edge servers with stronger computing capacity and more resources for execution, which can save energy of user devices and reduce the task computation time. Different offloading strategies will impact the number of tasks completed, latency, energy overhead and so on. This paper investigates the problem of maximizing the number of completed tasks while minimizing the average completion time, energy overhead and cost in MEC under both time and energy constraints. To solve the problem, we develop the mayfly genetic algorithm (MGA), which jointly optimizes task offloading locations and ratios, central processor unit (CPU) frequencies of user devices and computing capacities allocated to user devices by edge servers. Simulation experiments indicate that MGA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the number of completed tasks.

AB Precision is a crucial aspect of the decision-making (DM) process, and several techniques and systems have been developed to address the inherent vagueness and uncertainty that accompanies it. In recent years, the use of Cubic Pythagorean fuzzy (CPF) sets has gained significant attention due to their ability to capture more information in managing informational uncertainty. Additionally, the Dombi operator has been recognized for its high degree of versatility in dealing with imprecise decision-making environments. Building upon the advantages of CPF sets and the flexibility of Dombi t-norm and t-conorm, this article introduces novel aggregation operators, including the CPF Dombi-weighted averaging, and CPF Dombi-weighted geometric operators. These newly developed operators possess desirable features such as idempotency, commutativity, reducibility, monotonicity, and boundedness, which enhance their applicability in handling multi-criteria decision-making problems. To exhibit the efficiency of our proposed framework, we present a practical model involving the choice of a more stable cryptocurrency in the crypto-market. The results showcase the applicability and practicality of the proposed approach in addressing imprecision and uncertainty in real-world DM scenarios.

AB The precise estimation of the shear strength of reinforced concrete walls is critical for structural engineers. This projection, nevertheless, is exceedingly complicated because of the varied structural geometries, plethora of load cases, and highly nonlinear relationships between the design requirements and the shear strength. Recent related design code regulations mostly depend on experimental formulations, which have a variety of constraints and establish low prediction accuracy. Hence, different soft computing techniques are used in this study to evaluate the shear capacity of reinforced concrete walls. In particular, developed models for estimating the shear capacity of concrete walls have been investigated, based on experimental test data accessible in the relevant literature. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, the integrated genetic algorithms, and the integrated particle swarm optimization methods were used to optimize the fuzzy model's membership function range and the results were compared to the outcomes of random forests (RF) model. To determine the accuracy of the models, the results were assessed using several indices. Outliers in the anticipated data were identified and replaced with appropriate values to ensure prediction accuracy. The comparison of the resulting findings with the relevant experimental data demonstrates the potential of hybrid models to determine the shear capacity of reinforced concrete walls reliably and effectively. The findings revealed that the RF model with RMSE = 151.89, MAE = 111.52, and R-2 = 0.9351 has the best prediction accuracy. Integrated GAFIS and PSOFIS performed virtually identically and had fewer errors than ANFIS. The sensitivity analysis shows that the thickness of the wall (b(w)) and concrete compressive strength (f(c)) have the most and the least effects on shear strength, respectively.

AB Flexible electronics have gained popularity because of their capability to combine softness and functionality. Soft resistive sensors are susceptible to mechanical stimuli and detecting temperature selectively remains a challenge. In this study, soft flexible thermistors are developed for detecting temperature changes based on the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect, selectively. By thermomechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, it is observed that thermoplastic elastomers with higher thermal expansion and semicrystalline morphology result in a sensitive thermistor response. To achieve a high sensitivity in temperature and low sensitivity in the detection of mechanical stimulus, a low-carbon filler content is required. The opposite trend is seen for the piezoresistive sensors for mechanical strain detection. Both sensory material types are compatible with thermoplastic material extrusion-based additive manufacturing. The method is used for the fabrication of the sensing elements and an open-source prosthetic hand. The strain sensor detects the bending of the fingers and the temperature sensor detects the temperature when in contact with a heated surface, successfully. In addition, the temperature sensor is used as a tactile sensor to detect contact with a non-heated surface. Combining selective multisensory capabilities will significantly affect the future development of sensorized prosthetic devices and wearable electronics.

AB Automatic kidney and tumor segmentation from CT volumes is a critical prerequisite/tool for diagnosis and surgical treatment (such as partial nephrectomy). However, it remains a particularly challenging issue as kidneys and tumors often exhibit large-scale variations, irregular shapes, and blurring boundaries. We propose a novel 3-D network to comprehensively tackle these problems; we call it 3DSN-Net. Compared with existing solutions, it has two compelling characteristics. First, with a new scale-aware feature extraction (SAFE) module, the proposed 3DSN-Net is capable of adaptively selecting appropriate receptive fields according to the sizes of targets instead of indiscriminately enlarging them, which is particularly essential for improving the segmentation accuracy of the tumor with large scale variation. Second, we propose a novel yet efficient nonlocal context guidance (NCG) mechanism to capture global dependencies to tackle irregular shapes and blurring boundaries of kidneys and tumors. Instead of directly harnessing a 3-D NCG mechanism, which makes the number of parameters exponentially increase and hence the network difficult to be trained under limited training data, we develop a 2.5D NCG mechanism based on projections of feature cubes, which achieves a tradeoff between segmentation accuracy and network complexity. We extensively evaluate the proposed 3DSN-Net on the famous KiTS dataset with many challenging kidney and tumor cases. Experimental results demonstrate our solution consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3-D networks after being equipped with scale aware and NCG mechanisms, particularly for tumor segmentation.

AB There are currently promising developments in deep learning for protein design, with applications in drug discovery and synthetic biology. For more efficient exploration of the design space, Wang et al. demonstrate a reinforcement learning method, EvoZero, for directed evolution in protein engineering towards desired functional or structure-related properties.
   Designing protein sequences towards desired properties is a fundamental goal of protein engineering, with applications in drug discovery and enzymatic engineering. Machine learning-guided directed evolution has shown success in expediting the optimization cycle and reducing experimental burden. However, efficient sampling in the vast design space remains a challenge. To address this, we propose EvoPlay, a self-play reinforcement learning framework based on the single-player version of AlphaZero. In this work, we mutate a single-site residue as an action to optimize protein sequences, analogous to playing pieces on a chessboard. A policy-value neural network reciprocally interacts with look-ahead Monte Carlo tree search to guide the optimization agent with breadth and depth. We extensively evaluate EvoPlay on a suite of in silico directed evolution tasks over full-length sequences or combinatorial sites using functional surrogates. EvoPlay also supports AlphaFold2 as a structural surrogate to design peptide binders with high affinities, validated by binding assays. Moreover, we harness EvoPlay to prospectively engineer luciferase, resulting in the discovery of variants with 7.8-fold bioluminescence improvement beyond wild type. In sum, EvoPlay holds great promise for facilitating protein design to tackle unmet academic, industrial and clinical needs.

AB Out of the large number of neoepitopes, few elicit an immune response from the major histocompatibility complex. To predict which neoepitopes can be effective, Albert and colleagues present a method based on long short-term memory ensembles and transfer learning from immunogenicity assays.
   Identifying neoepitopes that elicit an adaptive immune response is a major bottleneck to developing personalized cancer vaccines. Experimental validation of candidate neoepitopes is extremely resource intensive and the vast majority of candidates are non-immunogenic, creating a needle-in-a-haystack problem. Here we address this challenge, presenting computational methods for predicting class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) epitopes and identifying immunogenic neoepitopes with improved precision. The BigMHC method comprises an ensemble of seven pan-allelic deep neural networks trained on peptide-MHC eluted ligand data from mass spectrometry assays and transfer learned on data from assays of antigen-specific immune response. Compared with four state-of-the-art classifiers, BigMHC significantly improves the prediction of epitope presentation on a test set of 45,409 MHC ligands among 900,592 random negatives (area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.9733; area under the precision-recall curve = 0.8779). After transfer learning on immunogenicity data, BigMHC yields significantly higher precision than seven state-of-the-art models in identifying immunogenic neoepitopes, making BigMHC effective in clinical settings.

AB Optical waveguides create interesting opportunities in the area of soft sensing and electronic skins due to their potential for high flexibility, quick response time, and compactness. The loss or change of light intensities inside a waveguide can be measured and converted into useful sensing feedback such as strain or shape sensing. Compared to other approaches such as those based on microelectromechanical system modules or flexible conductors, the entire sensor state can be characterized by fewer sensing nodes and less encumbering wiring, allowing greater scalability. Herein, simple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors (PDs) combined with an intelligent shape decoding framework are utilized to enable 3D shape sensing of a self-contained flexible substrate. Multiphysics finite element analysis is leveraged to optimize the PDs/LEDs layout and enrich ground-truth data from sparse to dense points for model training. The mapping from light intensities to overall sensor shape is achieved with an autoregression-based model that considers temporal continuity and spatial locality. The sensing framework is evaluated on an A5-sized flexible sensor prototype and a fish-shaped prototype, where sensing accuracy (RMSE = 0.27 mm) and repeatability (& UDelta; light intensity <0.31% over 1000 cycles) are tested underwater.

ID ARTIFICIAL CILIA; SIMULATION; MODEL
AB Metachronal motions are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic organisms and have attracted substantial attention in engineering for their potential applications. Hard-magnetic soft materials are shown to provide new opportunities for metachronal wave-modulated robotic locomotion by multi-agent active morphing in response to external magnetic fields. However, the design and optimization of such magnetic soft robots can be complex, and the fabrication and magnetization processes are often delicate and time-consuming. Herein, a computational model is developed that integrates granular models into a magnetic-lattice model, both of which are implemented in the highly efficient parallel computing platform large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The simulations accurately reproduce the deformation of single cilium, the metachronal wave motion of multiple cilia, and the crawling and rolling locomotion of magnetic cilia soft robots. Furthermore, the simulations provide insight into the spatial and temporal variation of friction forces and trajectories of cilia tips. The results contribute to the understanding of metachronal wave-modulated locomotion and potential applications in the field of soft robotics and biomimetic engineering. The developed model also provides a versatile computational framework for simulating the movement of magnetic soft robots in realistic environments and has the potential to guide the design, optimization, and customization of these systems.

AB Very recently, with the widespread research of deep learning, its achievements are increasingly evident in image inpainting tasks. However, many existing multi-stage methods fail to effectively inpainting the larger missing areas, their common drawback is that the result of each stage is easily misguided by the wrong content generated in the previous stage. To solve this issue, in this paper, a novel one-stage generative adversarial network based on the progressive decoding architecture and gradient guidance. Firstly, gradient priors are extracted at the encoder stage to be passed to the decoding branch, and multiscale attention fusion group is used to help the network understand the image features. Secondly, multiple parallel decoding branches fill and refine the missing regions by top-down passing the reconstructed priors. This progressively guided repair avoids the detrimental effects of inappropriate priors. The joint guidance of features and gradient priors helps the restoration results contain the correct structure and rich details. And the progressive guidance is achieved by our fusion strategy, combining reimage convolution and design channel coordinate attention to fuse and reweight the features of different branches. Finally, we use the multiscale fusion to merge the feature maps at different scales reconstructed by the last decoding branch and map them to the image space, which further improves the semantic plausibility of the restoration results. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the qualitative and quantitative results of our computationally efficient model are competitive with those of state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this article, we introduce logarithmic operations on bipolar fuzzy numbers (BFNs). We present some new operators based on these operations, namely, the logarithm bipolar fuzzy weighted averaging (L-BFWA) operator, logarithm bipolar fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (L-BFOWA) operator, and logarithm bipolar fuzzy weighted geometric (L-BFWG) operator, and logarithm bipolar fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (L-BFOWG) operator. Further, develop a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) methodology model based on logarithm bipolar fuzzy weighted averaging operator and logarithm bipolar fuzzy weighted geometric operators. To justify the proposed model's efficiency, MABAC (the multiple attribute border approximation area comparison) methods are applied to construct MAGDM with BFNs established on proposed operators. To demonstrate the proposed approach's materiality and efficiency, use the proposed method to solve supply chain management by considering numerical examples for supplier selection. The selection of suppliers is investigated by aggregation operators to verify the MABAC technique. The presented method is likened to some existing accumulation operators to study the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model. We concluded that the proposed model is accurate, effective, and reliable.

AB View-invariant action recognition has been widely researched in various applications, such as visual surveillance and human-robot interaction. However, view-invariant human action recognition is challenging due to the action occlusions and information loss caused by view changes. Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of body joints and minimizing representation discrepancy between different views could be a valuable solution for view-invariant human action recognition. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Attention Network (DANet) aims to learn robust video representation for view-invariant action recognition. The DANet is composed of relation-aware spatiotemporal self-attention and spatiotemporal cross-attention modules. The relation-aware spatiotemporal self-attention module learns representative and discriminative action features. This module captures local and global long-range dependencies, as well as pairwise relations among human body parts and joints in the spatial and temporal domains. The cross-attention module learns view-invariant attention maps and generates discriminative features for semantic representations of actions in different views. We exhaustively evaluate our proposed approach on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and UESTC large-scale challenging datasets with multi-type evaluation metrics including Cross-Subject, Cross-View, Cross-Set, and Arbitrary-view. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in view-invariant action recognition.

AB Predicting future frames through image-to-image translation and using these synthetically generated frames for high-speed ground vehicle teleoperation is a new concept to address latency and enhance operational performance. In the immediate previous work, the image quality of the predicted frames was low and a lot of scene detail was lost. To preserve the structural details of objects and improve overall image quality in the predicted frames, several novel ideas are proposed herein. A filter has been designed to remove noise from dense optical flow components resulting from frame rate inconsistencies. The Pix2Pix base network has been modified and a structure-aware SSIM-based perpetual loss function has been implemented. A new dataset of 20 000 training input images and 2000 test input images with a 500 ms delay between the target and input frames has been created. Without any additional video transformation steps, the proposed improved model achieved PSNR of 23.1; SSIM of 0.65; and MS-SSIM of 0.80, a substantial improvement over our previous work. A Fleiss' kappa score of >0.40 (0.48 for the modified network and 0.46 for the perpetual loss function) proves the reliability of the model.

TI Statistical limitations of sensitive itemset hiding methods
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Privacy preserving data mining; Itemset suppression; Heuristic
   approaches; Outlier detection
AB Frequent Itemset Hiding has long been an area of study for privacy-preserving data mining. The goal is to alter a dataset so that it may be released without revealing particular sensitive aggregates (e.g., frequent itemsets or association rules.) Typically the approach is to remove items from transactions to reduce the support of the sensitive itemset(s) below a threshold, while minimizing the changes or impact on other frequent itemsets. In this paper, we ask if such hiding can be discovered: Do hiding methods lead to anomalies that suggest that a sensitive itemset likely existed in the dataset, and has been hidden? We show that a suppressed sensitive itemset may behave like an outlier among its neighboring itemsets after suppression, indicating that the dataset is likely altered. KL-divergence and ?(2)-divergence are used to calculate the difference between expected and actual probability distributions of itemsets for observing anomalous behavior. Experimental results on four datasets show that suppressed sensitive itemsets often stand out as the most significant outlier in many cases, irrespective of the victim item selection method. We propose two defensive approaches that counter this attack.

AB Efficient management of aircraft and crew recovery system is crucial for cost savings and improving the satisfaction, which are related to the airline's reputation. However, most existing work considers only one objective of minimizing costs or maximizing satisfaction. In this study, we propose a new integrated multi-objective recovery system that takes both cost and satisfaction into account simultaneously. To better capture crew satisfaction in the event of airport closure, a bidding mechanism for early off-duty task is designed. To overcome the experience-dependent and labour-consuming problems associated with current manual or mathematical recoveries, we develop an intelligent optimizer based on multi-swarm and MOPSO frameworks, termed adaptive seeking and tracking multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (ASTMOPSO). Specifically, during the evolutionary process, the sub-swarm size undergoes adaptive internal transfer while executing more efficient evolutionary strategies to approach the global Pareto front. Additionally, five ad-hoc repair procedures are designed to ensure feasibility for our aircraft and crew recovery system. The ASTMOPSO is applied to real-world instances from Shenzhen Airlines with different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate the statistical superiority of our method over other popular peer algorithms. And the infeasible solution repair procedures significantly improve the feasibility rate by at least 40%, particularly for large-scale instances.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The current instance segmentation method can achieve satisfactory results in common scenarios. However, under the overlap or partial occlusion between targets caused by the complex scenes, accurate segmentation of pigs remains a challenging task. To address the problem, the authors propose an instance segmentation method based on Mask Scoring region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) (MS R-CNN), which creates the adversarial network called MaskDis in the head branch of MS R-CNN. The MaskDis is trained as a discriminator using a generative adversarial network, and the MS R-CNN model is used as a generator during model training. The adversarial training enables the generator to learn context information and features at the pixel level, which effectively improves the segmentation quality under pigs' overlapping or dense occlusions scenes. Experimental conducted on the pig object segmentation dataset show that the proposed approach achieves a precision of 92.03%, a recall of 92.18%, and an F1 score of 0.9210. Compared with the basic MS R-CNN model, the approach achieved a 2.25% improvement in precision and 1.18% improvement in F1 score. Furthermore, the improved approach outperformed advanced instance segmentation methods such as YOLACT, Swin Transformer, YOLOv5-seg, and SOLOv2 on COCO evaluation metrics. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in instance segmentation of pigs in complex scenes, providing technical support for non-contact pig automatic management.

AB Neural Process (NP) fully combines the advantages of neural network and Gaussian Process (GP) to provide an efficient method for solving regression problems. Nonetheless, limited by the dimensionality of the latent variable, NP has difficulty fitting the observed data completely and predicting the targets perfectly. To remedy these drawbacks, the authors propose a concise and effective improvement of the latent path of NP, which the authors term Multi-Latent Variables Neural Process (MLNP). MLNP samples multiple latent variables and integrates the representations corresponding to the latent variables in the decoder with adaptive weights. MLNP inherits the desirable property of linear computation scales of NP and learns the approximate distribution over objective functions from contexts more flexibly and accurately. By applying MLNP to 1-D regression, real-world image completion, which can be seen as a 2-D regression task, the authors demonstrate its significant improvement in the accuracy of prediction and contexts fitting capability compared with NP. Through ablation experiments, the authors also verify that the number of latent variables has a great impact on the prediction accuracy and fitting capability of MLNP. Moreover, the authors also analyze the roles played by different latent variables in reconstructing images.

AB Risk-taking is a ubiquitous behavior and its assessment is a central aspect of understanding human decision-making. Self-report questionnaires can be used to probe risk-taking propensities in a domain-specific manner. In contrast, most behavioral tools for risk-taking assessment provide nonspecific, unitary measures with a strong bias towards risk scenarios involving monetary gains and losses tied to probabilities. In the current work, we evaluate a behavioral task designed to specifically address recreational risk-taking, that is, situations where decision-making is driven by intrinsic motivation and performance is rewarding in its own right. For this, we chose the Tower Building Task (TBT), in which participants use wooden blocks to attempt to build the tallest tower they can; a trial ends if the building collapses, the allotted time ends, or the builder is satisfied with their tower. We correlated the TBT scores with each of the domains provided by two widely used self-report instruments, the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking scale (DOSPERT) and the Evolutionary Domain-Specific Risk scale (ERS). We found small, but significant correlations between TBT scores and those of (i) the recreational domain of the DOSPERT as well as (ii) the environmental exploration domain of the ERS. These correlation values reflect a small degree of similarity between these tests, suggesting that they capture some aspects of the complex construct that is recreation. However, the small magnitude of the correlations highlights the need for a complementary set of tools to evaluate the full spectrum of recreational risk-taking activities.

AB State-of-the-art aerial robots often prioritize maneuverability or manipulation capabilities, making it difficult to achieve both. The issue arises because aerial robots with agile mobility lack sufficient rotors for manipulation tasks, while those with manipulation ability are too large for agile mobility. To tackle this problem, a novel aerial robot unit named TRADY, tilted-rotor-equipped aerial robot with autonomous in-flight assembly and disassembly capability, is introduced. The TRADY unit can self-assemble/disassemble with another unit in mid-air, adjusting the aircraft's control freedom by switching between under-actuated and fully-actuated control models. The system implementation involves a docking mechanism design, optimized rotor configuration, as well as a control system with the ability to switch between under-actuated and fully-actuated controllers. A proposed state transition method compensates for discrete changes during the controller switchover process. Also, a motion strategy for assembly/disassembly with hazardous condition recovery behavior is presented. Finally, through experiments, TRADY demonstrated a 90 % success rate in executing assembly/disassembly motions, and in the assembly state, it can utilize full-pose tracking and generate over nine times the torque of a single unit. This is the first aerial robot developed to perform both assembly and disassembly while seamlessly transitioning between fully-actuated and under-actuated models.

AB In this paper, we propose VT-BPAN, a novel approach that combines the capabilities of Vision Transformer (VT), bilinear pooling, and attention network fusion for effective human action recognition (HAR). The proposed methodology significantly enhances the accuracy of activity recognition through the following advancements: (1) The introduction of an effective two-stream feature pooling and fusion mechanism that combines RGB frames and skeleton data to augment the spatial-temporal feature representation. (2) The development of a spatial lightweight vision transformer that mitigates computational costs. The evaluation of this framework encompasses three widely employed video action datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods.

AB The accurate dynamic model of the chemical process is an important condition for the successful implementation of advanced control in the plant. In this paper, an efficient second order algorithm for long short-term memory (LSTM) network training is proposed for chemical process intelligent identification. A novel Hessian inverse recursion method is adopted to achieve fast convergence and avoid the high-cost operation of the classic second order optimization method. Besides, more information is back propagated since the proposed method retains the real curvature information of the neural network. Considering the large amount of chemical process data, a sub-sampled recursive second order-stochastic gradient descent (SRSO-SGD) algorithm which uses sub-sampling method and hybrid strategy is proposed. The identification experiment on a delayed coker fractionator shows that the proposed sub-sampled neural network second order training algorithm has better performance than other learning algorithms in terms of model identification accuracy and convergence speed. By adopting a hybrid strategy that performing Hessian inverse estimation every 3 training epochs, the expensive Hessian inverse calculation cost in the identification process is further reduced while low training and testing errors are maintained.

AB Coastal grounding electrodes are currently an important means to alleviate land grounding electrode land constraints. In order to better invert the terrestrial geodesic resistivity in the coastal region, this paper proposes a complete set of inversion technology schemes. First, this paper proposes a layered land model for the coastal region, and a composite geodetic model is modeled by the fold junction of the land model and the ocean. Based on this, an adaptive subdivision boundary element method is proposed for solving the composite soil grounding calculation problem, and the accuracy and advantages of the method are demonstrated by examples. Finally, the paper uses the differential evolutionary algorithm to invert the exploration data of the four-point method in the coastal area, and obtains the parameters of the terrestrial layered geodetic model that meet the engineering requirements. The comparison with the grounding software CDEGS illustrates the effectiveness of the method. This paper carries out the research on the modeling and inversion methods of composite layered soil model, combining advanced numerical calculation methods and artificial intelligence algorithms to provide the support of computational tools for coastal resistivity inversion.

TI Weighted neural tangent kernel: a generalized and improved

SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE Neural tangent kernel; Over-parameterization; Adjusted descent direction
AB The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has recently attracted intense study, as it describes the evolution of an over-parameterized neural network (NN) trained by gradient descent. However, it is now well-known that gradient descent is not always a good optimizer for NNs, which can partially explain the unsatisfactory practical performance of the NTK regression estimator. In this paper, we introduce the weighted neural tangent kernel (WNTK), a generalized and improved tool, which can capture an over-parameterized NN's training dynamics under adjusted gradient descent direction. Theoretically, in the infinite-width limit, we prove: (1) the stability of the WNTK at initialization and during training, and (2) the equivalence between the WNTK regression estimator and the corresponding NN estimator with different learning rates on different parameters. With the proposed weight update algorithm, weight terms, or equivalently NN descent directions, can be trained through multiple-kernel optimization. Both empirical and analytical WNTKs outperform the corresponding NTKs in numerical experiments, coinciding with the fact that adjusted gradient descent could outperform original gradient descent in NNs' training.

AB Digital Twins (DTs) are emerging as a fundamental brick of engineering Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), but their notion is still mostly bound to specific business domains (e.g. manufacturing), goals (e.g. product design), or applications (e.g. the Internet of Things). As such, their value as general purpose engineering abstractions is yet to be fully revealed. In this paper, we relate DTs with agents and multiagent systems, as the latter are arguably the most rich abstractions available for the engineering of complex socio-technical and CPSs, and the former could both fill in some gaps in agent-oriented software engineering and benefit from an agent-oriented interpretation-in a cross-fertilisation journey.

AB Decision systems for solving real-world combinatorial problems must be able to report infeasibility in such a way that users can understand the reasons behind it, and determine how to modify the problem to restore feasibility. Current methods mainly focus on reporting one or more subsets of the problem constraints that cause infeasibility. Methods that also show users how to restore feasibility tend to be less flexible and/or problem-dependent. We describe a problem-independent approach to feasibility restoration that combines existing techniques from the literature in novel ways to yield meaningful, useful, practical, and flexible user support. We evaluated the resulting framework on three real-world applications and conducted a qualitative expert user study with participants from different application domains.

   feature extraction; Object-centric machine learning
AB Process mining techniques have proven crucial in identifying performance and compliance issues. Traditional process mining, however, is primarily case-centric and does not fully capture the complexity of real-life information systems, leading to a growing interest in object-centric process mining. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for feature extraction from object-centric event logs. In contrast to established methods for feature extraction from traditional event logs, object-centric logs present a greater challenge due to the interconnected nature of events related to multiple objects. This paper addresses this gap by proposing techniques and tools for feature extraction specifically designed for object-centric event logs. In this work, we focus on features pertaining to the lifecycle of the objects and their interaction. These features enable a more comprehensive understanding of the process and its inherent complexities. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through its implementation in two significant areas: anomaly detection and throughput time prediction for objects in the process. Our results, based on four problems in a Procure-to-Pay process, affirm the potential of our proposed features in enhancing the scope of process mining. By effectively transforming object-centric event logs into numeric vectors, we pave the way for the application of a broader range of machine learning techniques, such as classification, prediction, clustering, and anomaly detection, thereby extending the capabilities of process mining.

AB This paper is concerned with chaotic stabilization analysis for a class of memristive neural networks (MNNs) with the effects of neutral delay and time-varying delay. We introduce a time-varying delay into reliable controller to enhance the model, while actuators experience failure signals. Sampled-data controller and reliable time-varying controller are implemented using input-delay approach and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The main analysis of this present work is to utilize Lyapunov stability theory, differential inclusion theory and set-valued maps. By constructing a proper Lyapunov functionals, some sets of sufficient conditions are achieved in terms of LMIs. The considered MNNs with actuator fault guarantee the global asymptotic stability for known and unknown actuators cases. The process of congruence transformation has been applied to reliable time-varying controller to get a gain matrix. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the less conservatism and effectiveness of the proposed results via MATLAB simulations.

AB Symbolic optimization methods have been used to solve varied challenging and relevant problems such as symbolic regression and neural architecture search. However, the current state of the art typically learns each problem from scratch and is unable to leverage pre-existing knowledge and datasets that are available for many applications. Inspired by the similarity between sequence representations learned in natural language processing and the formulation of symbolic optimization as a discrete sequence optimization problem, we propose language model-accelerated deep symbolic optimization (LA-DSO), a method that leverages language models to learn symbolic optimization solutions more efficiently. We demonstrate LA-DSO in two tasks: symbolic regression, which allows us to perform extensive experimentation due to its low computation requirements, and computational antibody optimization, which shows that our proposal accelerates learning in challenging real-world problems.

AB This article describes a method to analyze time series with a neural network using a matrix of area-normalized persistence landscapes obtained with topological data analysis. The network's architecture includes a gating layer that is able to identify the most relevant landscape levels for a classification task, thus working as an importance attribution system. Next, a matching is performed between the selected landscape levels and the corresponding critical points of the original time series. This matching enables reconstruction of a simplified shape of the time series that gives insight into the grounds of the classification decision. As a use case, this technique is tested in the article with input data from a dataset of electrocardiographic signals. The classification accuracy obtained using only a selection of landscape levels from data was 94:00% +/- 0:13 averaged after five runs of a neural network, while the original signals achieved 98:41% +/- 0:09 and landscape-reduced signals yielded 97: 04% +/- 0:14.

AB Current state-of-the-art audio analysis algorithms based on deep learning rely on hand-crafted Spectrogram-like audio representations, that are more compact than descriptors obtained from the raw waveform; the latter are, in turn, far from achieving good generalization capabilities when few data are available for the training. However, Spectrogram-like representations have two main limitations: (1) The parameters of the filters are defined a priori, regardless of the specific audio analysis task; (2) such representations do not perform any denoising operation on the audio signal, neither in the time domain nor in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new general-purpose convolutional architecture for audio analysis tasks that we call DEGramNet, which is trained with audio samples described with a novel, compact and learnable time-frequency representation that we call DEGram. The proposed representation is fully trainable: Indeed, it is able to learn the frequencies of interest for the specific audio analysis task; in addition, it performs denoising through a custom time-frequency attention module, which amplifies the frequency and time components in which the sound is actually located. It implies that the proposed representation can be easily adapted to the specific problem at hands, for instance giving more importance to the voice frequencies when the network needs to be used for speaker recognition. DEGramNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on the VGGSound dataset (for Sound Event Classification) and comparable accuracy with a complex and special-purpose approach based on network architecture search over the VoxCeleb dataset (for Speaker Identification). Moreover, we demonstrate that DEGram allows to achieve high accuracy with lightweight neural networks that can be used in real-time on embedded systems, making the solution suitable for Cognitive Robotics applications.

AB To improve the anti-disturbance and reliability performance for unmanned surface vehicles subject to actuator faults and external disturbances, an adaptive event-triggered observer-based output feedback control method is proposed. Firstly, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is established by considering unknown disturbances and actuator faults. Secondly, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism is designed and then the state and disturbance observers are constructed using the output of the event generator. Based on the outputs of the observers, an adaptive event-triggered observer-based output feedback dynamic positioning controller is developed and the asymptotical stability with H-8 performance is analyzed via the Lyapunov function method. Finally, the advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated via an example.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Semantic segmentation; Weakly supervised learning; Class-agnostic masks;
   Cross-task; Deep convolutional neural network
AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) commonly relies on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to produce pseudo semantic labels using image-level annotations. However, because CAM maps often form sparse object regions with poor boundaries, they cannot provide sufficient segmentation supervision. Because off-the-shelf saliency maps can provide rich object boundaries that can be leveraged to improve semantic segmentation, we propose to jointly learn semantic segmentation and class-agnostic masks by using image-level annotations and off-the-shelf saliency maps as supervision. We also propose a cross-task label refinement mechanism, which takes advantage of the learned class-agnostic masks and semantic segmentation masks, to refine the pseudo labels and provide more accurate supervision to both tasks. Moreover, we introduce a new normalization method for CAM to generate more complete class-specific localization maps. The improved CAM maps complement our learned class-agnostic masks, leading to high-quality pseudo semantic segmentation labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with state-of-the-art WSSS results established on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO.

AB Cross-modal audio-visual correlation learning has been an interesting research topic, which aims to capture and understand semantic correspondences between audio and video. We face two challenges during audio-visual correlation learning: (i) audio and visual feature sequences, respectively, belong to different feature spaces, and (ii) semantic mismatch between audio and visual sequences inevitably happens. To solve these challenges, existing works mainly focus on how to efficiently extract discriminative features, while ignoring the abundant granular features of audio and visual modalities. In this work, we introduce the multi-scale network with shared cross-attention (MSNSCA) module for audio-visual correlation learning, a supervised representation learning framework for capturing semantic audio-visual correspondences by integrating a multi-scale feature extraction module with strong cross-attention into an end-to-end trainable deep network. MSNSCA can extract more effective audio-visual particle features with excellent audio-visual semantic matching capability. Experiments on various audio-visual learning tasks, including audio-visual matching and retrieval on benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MSNSCA model.

AB This article centers around investigating the event-triggered nonsingular fixed-time tracking issue for an $n$ -link rigid robot manipulator with full-state constraints, external disturbances, and model uncertainties. We propose the definition of the constrainedly practically fixed-time stability (CPFTS) and provide a sufficient condition for CPFTS. A novel auxiliary function is developed to address the singularity issue caused by repeated differentiation in achieving the fixed-time tracking control. The uncertain parameters are approximated using the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). This study proposes the model-based and the neutral network-based tracking control approaches, designed using the scaling function technique and the barrier Lyapunov function, respectively, to ensure that the tracking error systems are CPFTS and the full-state constraints comply. Moreover, the communication transmission load is reduced using the relative threshold event-triggered control strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control algorithms.

AB Deep learning can be used to achieve single-image superresolution (SR) reconstruction. To address problems encountered during this process, such as the number of network parameters, high training requirements on equipment performance, and inability to downsample certain SR images accurately, an image SR reconstruction algorithm based on deep residual network optimization is proposed. The model introduces wavelet transforms based on the original U-Net, where the U-Net is trained to obtain SR wavelet feature images at multiple scales simultaneously. This approach reduces the mapping space for the network to learn low- to high-resolution image mapping, which in turn reduces the training difficulty of the model. In terms of network details, the inverse wavelet transform is used in image upsampling to enhance the sparsity of the reconstruction layer in the original network. The network structure of the U-Net upsampling is adjusted slightly to enable the network to distinguish wavelet images from feature images, thereby improving the richness of the features extracted by the model. The experimental results show that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the fourfold SR model is 32.35 and 28.68 on the Set5 and Set14 validation sets, respectively. Compared with networks that use wavelet prediction mechanisms, such as the deep wavelet prediction SR (DWSR) and deep wavelet prediction-based residual SR (DWRSR) models, the PSNR for all the tested public datasets is improved by 0.5. The method yields superior results in terms of both visual effect and PSNR, demonstrating the feasibility of the wavelet prediction mechanism in SR reconstruction and thus offering application value and research significance.

AB IntroductionGlobally, the prevalence of mental health problems, especially depression, is at an all-time high. The objective of this study is to utilize machine learning models and sentiment analysis techniques to predict the level of depression earlier in social media users' posts. MethodsThe datasets used in this research were obtained from Twitter posts. Four machine learning models, namely extreme gradient boost (XGB) Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and support vector machine (SVM), were employed for the prediction task. ResultsThe SVM and Logistic Regression models yielded the most accurate results when applied to the provided datasets. However, the Logistic Regression model exhibited a slightly higher level of accuracy compared to SVM. Importantly, the logistic regression model demonstrated the advantage of requiring less execution time. DiscussionThe findings of this study highlight the potential of utilizing machine learning models and sentiment analysis techniques for early detection of depression in social media users. The effectiveness of SVM and Logistic Regression models, with Logistic Regression being more efficient in terms of execution time, suggests their suitability for practical implementation in real-world scenarios.

AB Automated source separation algorithms have become a central tool in neuroengineering and neuroscience, where they are used to decompose neurophysiological signal into its constituent spiking sources. However, in noisy or highly multivariate recordings these decomposition techniques often make a large number of errors. Such mistakes degrade online human-machine interfacing methods and require costly post-hoc manual cleaning in the offline setting. In this article we propose an automated error correction methodology using a deep metric learning (DML) framework, generating embedding spaces in which spiking events can be both identified and assigned to their respective sources. Furthermore, we investigate the relative ability of different DML techniques to preserve the intraclass semantic structure needed to identify incorrect class labels in neurophysiological time series. Motivated by this analysis, we propose locality sensitive mining, an easily implemented sampling-based augmentation to typical DML losses which substantially improves the local semantic structure of the embedding space. We demonstrate the utility of this method to generate embedding spaces which can be used to automatically identify incorrectly labeled spiking events with high accuracy.

AB In this article, we propose a collaborative neurodynamic optimization (CNO) method for the distributed seeking of generalized Nash equilibriums (GNEs) in multicluster games with nonconvex functions. Based on an augmented Lagrangian function, we develop a projection neural network for the local search of GNEs, and its convergence to a local GNE is proven. We formulate a global optimization problem to which a global optimal solution is a high-quality local GNE, and we adopt a CNO approach consisting of multiple recurrent neural networks for scattering searches and a metaheuristic rule for reinitializing states. We elaborate on an example of a price-bidding problem in an electricity market to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach.

AB Over the last decade, transfer learning has attracted a great deal of attention as a new learning paradigm, based on which fault diagnosis (FD) approaches have been intensively developed to improve the safety and reliability of modern automation systems. Because of inevitable factors such as the varying work environment, performance degradation of components, and heterogeneity among similar automation systems, the FD method having long-term applicabilities becomes attractive. Motivated by these facts, transfer learning has been an indispensable tool that endows the FD methods with self-learning and adaptive abilities. On the presentation of basic knowledge in this field, a comprehensive review of transfer learning-motivated FD methods, whose two subclasses are developed based on knowledge calibration and knowledge compromise, is carried out in this survey article. Finally, some open problems, potential research directions, and conclusions are highlighted. Different from the existing reviews of transfer learning, this survey focuses on how to utilize previous knowledge specifically for the FD tasks, based on which three principles and a new classification strategy of transfer learning-motivated FD techniques are also presented. We hope that this work will constitute a timely contribution to transfer learning-motivated techniques regarding the FD topic.

DT Article; Early Access
DE & nbsp;Adaptive learning; online learning; sparse Gaussian process (GP);
   variational learning
AB Adaptive learning is necessary for nonstationary environments where the learning machine needs to forget past data distribution. Efficient algorithms require a compact model update to not grow in computational burden with the incoming data and with the lowest possible computational cost for online parameter updating. Existing solutions only partially cover these needs. Here, we propose the first adaptive sparse Gaussian process (GP) able to address all these issues. We first reformulate a variational sparse GP (VSGP) algorithm to make it adaptive through a forgetting factor. Next, to make the model inference as simple as possible, we propose updating a single inducing point of the SGP model together with the remaining model parameters every time a new sample arrives. As a result, the algorithm presents a fast convergence of the inference process, which allows an efficient model update (with a single inference iteration) even in highly nonstationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm and its good performance in modeling the predictive posterior in mean and confidence interval estimation compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

ID INFORMATION DIFFUSION
AB Information diffusion prediction captures diffusion dynamics of online messages in social networks. Thus, it is the basis of many essential tasks such as popularity prediction and viral marketing. However, there are two thorny problems caused by the loss of spatial-temporal properties of cascade data: "position-hopping" and "branch-independency." The former means no exact propagation relationship between any two consecutive infected users. The latter indicates that not all previously infected users contribute to the prediction of the next infected user. This article proposes the GRU-like Attention Unit and Structural Spreading (GRASS) model for microscopic cascade prediction to overcome the above two problems. First, we introduce the attention mechanism into the gated recurrent unit (GRU) component to expand the restricted receptive field of the recurrent neural network (RNN)-type module, thus addressing the "position-hopping" problem. Second, the structural spreading (SS) mechanism leverages structural features to filter out related users and controls the generation of cascade hidden states, thereby solving the "branch-independency" problem. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on both hits@? and map@? metrics. Furthermore, the visualization of latent representations by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) indicates that our model makes different cascades more discriminative during the encoding process.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Deep spatiotemporal clustering; spatiotemporal coupling; spatiotemporal
   evolution pattern detection; vehicle emissions' distribution
AB Spatiotemporal clustering of vehicle emissions, which reveals the evolution pattern of air pollution from road traffic, is a challenging representation learning task due to the lack of supervision. Some recent work building upon graph convolutional network (GCN) models the intrinsic spatiotemporal correlations among the nodes in road networks as graph representations for clustering. However, these existing methods ignore the interactions between spatial and temporal variations in vehicle emissions, resulting in incomplete descriptions and inaccurate detection of the evolution pattern of air pollution. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-way self-supervised spatiotemporal representation learning scheme, in which the temporal and spatial features are progressively learned in a mutually reinforced manner. Our proposed method is based on the observation that though the variation in vehicle emissions in the road network is consistent in the spatial and temporal domains, its expression is more distinct in temporal sequences. To this end, the input emission data are first projected into an initial temporal representation space spanned by the captured features from a pretrained BiLSTM network. Then the generated distribution of temporal features is used to construct an objective constraint for high-purity clustering through a two-way self-supervised mechanism, which is leveraged as a constraint for the feature clustering of a GCN. Furthermore, to eliminate the initial errors, a joint optimization scheme is presented to generate the decoupled clustering results through the progressive refinement of representation and clustering. Our proposed method is evaluated on the traffic emission dataset of Xian city in 2020, and the experimental results have demonstrated the superiority against the state-of-the-art.

TI Context-Aware Proposal-Boundary Network With Structural Consistency for
   Audiovisual Event Localization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Audiovisual learning; context learning; event localization
AB Audiovisual event localization aims to localize the event that is both visible and audible in a video. Previous works focus on segment-level audio and visual feature sequence encoding and neglect the event proposals and boundaries, which are crucial for this task. The event proposal features provide event internal consistency between several consecutive segments constructing one proposal, while the event boundary features offer event boundary consistency to make segments located at boundaries be aware of the event occurrence. In this article, we explore the proposal-level feature encoding and propose a novel context-aware proposal-boundary (CAPB) network to address audiovisual event localization. In particular, we design a local-global context encoder (LGCE) to aggregate local-global temporal context information for visual sequence, audio sequence, event proposals, and event boundaries, respectively. The local context from temporally adjacent segments or proposals contributes to event discrimination, while the global context from the entire video provides semantic guidance of temporal relationship. Furthermore, we enhance the structural consistency between segments by exploiting the above-encoded proposal and boundary representations. CAPB leverages the context information and structural consistency to obtain context-aware event-consistent cross-modal representation for accurate event localization. Extensive experiments conducted on the audiovisual event (AVE) dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by clear margins in both supervised event localization and cross-modality localization.

AB The performance of deep learning-based denoisers highly depends on the quantity and quality of training data. However, paired noisy-clean training images are generally unavailable in hyperspectral remote sensing areas. To solve this problem, this work resorts to the self-supervised learning technique, where our proposed model can train itself to learn one part of noisy input from another part of noisy input. We study a general hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising framework, called Eigenimage2Eigenimage (E2E), which turns the HSI denoising problem into an eigenimage (i.e., the subspace representation coefficients of the HSI) denoising problem and proposes a learning strategy to generate noisy-noisy paired training eigenimages from noisy eigenimages. Consequently, the E2E denoising framework can be trained without clean data and applied to denoise HSIs without the constraint with the number of frequency bands. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method that is better than the other existing deep learning methods for denoising HSIs. A MATLAB demo of this work is available at https://github.com/LinaZhuang/HSI-denoiser-Eigenimage2Eigenimagehttps://github.com/LinaZhuang/HSI-denoiser-Eigenimage2Eigenimage for the sake of reproducibility.

AB Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging has been proved to detect and predict the severity of progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The application of pre-processing with neuroimaging methods plays a vital role in post-processing for these problems. The development of technology over the years has enabled the use of deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . In this study, the detection of Parkinson's disease and the prediction of disease severity were studied with 2D and 3D CNN using T1-weighted MRIs that were pre-processed with FLIRT image registration and BET non-brain tissue scraper. For 2D CNN, the median slices of the MR images in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes were used separately and in combination. In addition, the whole brain for 3D CNN has been downsized. Considering the performance of the proposed methods, the highest results achieved for detecting Parkinson's disease were measured as 0.9620, 0.9452, 0.9407, and 0.9536 for Accuracy, F1 score, precision, and Recall, respectively. The highest result achieved for estimating the severity of Parkinson's disease was that 3D CNN was fed three times with a downsized whole MRI, which were measured for R, and R2 as 0.9150 and 0.8372, respectively. When the results obtained with the methods suggested within the scope of the study were examined, it was observed that the applied methods yielded promising performance.

AB Many of the artificial intelligence (AI) systems used nowadays have a very high level of accuracy but fail to explain their decisions. This is critical, especially in sensitive areas such as medicine and the health area at large but also for applications of the law, finance etc., where explanations for certain decisions are needed and are often useful and valuable as the decision itself. This paper presents a review of four different methods for creating transparency in AI systems. It also suggests a list of criteria under which circumstances one should use which methods.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Deep learning; Object detection; Sample imbalance; Sampling methods;
   Negative samples; Edge detection
AB In anchor-based object detection algorithms, achieving a balance between positive and negative samples during training is crucial. Many improved sampling methods have been proposed to address this issue. In our work, we propose an edge-detection guided balanced sampling (EBS) method that introduces edge and contour information from objects to guide the sampling of candidate negative samples and increase the number of hard negative samples to improve sample balance. The EBS method employs a Gaussian filter convolution on the binary image in HSV space to reduce local corner information, and furtherly applies K-means++ clustering to the bounding boxes to reduce redundancy. In the hard negative sample sampling stage of anchor-based detection algorithms, the EBS model selects negative sam-ples with higher IoU values with GT from both the normal candidate negative sample set and the special candidate negative sample set. The latter set contains more hard negative samples, which further improves the sample balance. We conducted comparison experiments using random sampling (RS) and IoU-balanced sampling (IBS) in the RPN network on MSCOCO-2017. Our EBS method achieved a 1.7-point higher higher AR(1000) than PRN. In particular, the proposed algorithm performs better on the small-target dataset, which achieves 2.4-point higher AR(S) than RPN. The inference fps of RPN and EBS are 22.3 and 22.4, respectively.

AB Due to the scarcity of nighttime semantic segmentation datasets and the high demand for network models, the development of semantic segmentation of nighttime scenes is still very slow. This paper proposes a new network model, ContourNet, which can model multi-level features. In addition, a separate contour network module is designed to accurately predict object contours, improving performance for objects far away, small, or with high contour continuity. A large number of experiments demonstrate that the ContourNet proposed in this paper can significantly improve the semantic segmentation ability of existing models for nighttime images, and can also improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime images to a certain extent, with good generalization abilities. Specifically, after adding the contour module in this article, MIoU has increased by 5.1% on the night dataset Rebecca; MIoU has increased by 2.5% on the daytime dataset CamVid.

AB Dysarthria is common in movement disorders, such as Wilson's disease (WD), Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. Dysarthria severity assessment is often indispensable for the management of these diseases. However, such assessment is usually labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. To seek efficient and cost-effective solutions for dysarthria assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered acoustic analysis system is proposed and its performance in a valuable sample of WD, an ideal disease model with mainly mixed dysarthria, is verified. A test-retest reliability analysis yields excellent reproducibility in the acoustic measures (mean intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.81). Then, a system for dysarthria assessment is trained with WD patients (n = 65) and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 65) using a machine learning approach. The system achieves reasonable performance in evaluating dysarthria severity with either stepwise classification or regression (all areas under the curve >80%; mean absolute error = 6.25, r = 0.79, p < 0.0001). The diadochokinesis and sustained phonation tasks contribute the most to prediction, and the corresponding acoustic features can provide significant and independent contributions. The present study demonstrates the feasibility and good performance of the AI-powered acoustic analysis framework, offering the potential to facilitate early screening and subsequent management of dysarthria.

ID FEATURES; NETWORK
AB Learning-based edge detection has hereunto been strongly supervised with pixel-wise annotations which are tedious to obtain manually. We study the problem of self-training edge detection, leveraging the untapped wealth of large-scale unlabeled image datasets. We design a self-supervised framework with multilayer regularization and self-teaching. In particular, we impose a consistency regularization which enforces the outputs from each of the multiple layers to be consistent for the input image and its perturbed counterpart. We adopt L0-smoothing as the "perturbation" to encourage edge prediction lying on salient boundaries following the cluster assumption in self-supervised learning. Meanwhile, the network is trained with multilayer supervision by pseudo labels which are initialized with Canny edges and then iteratively refined by the network as the training proceeds. The regularization and self-teaching together attain a good balance of precision and recall, leading to a significant performance boost over supervised methods, with lightweight refinement on the target dataset. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates strong cross-dataset generality and can improve the original performance of edge detectors after self-training and fine-tuning.

AB Endowing tactile feedback for prosthetic hands is profound for upper-limb amputees. However, existing prosthetic hands are generally not in possession of the embedded sensory feedback. Herein, a flexible tactile sensor array which can be integrated into an untethered soft prosthetic hand to achieve static and dynamic discrimination tasks is presented. The flexible piezoresistive sensory arrays with 25 sensor units which can be arranged on five fingers of the soft prosthetic hand are fabricated. According to the collected large-scale tactile dataset (including pressure distribution and pressure magnitude) during different grasping tasks, a learning-based classification model that can reveal the correspondences between tactile information and object attributes while interacting with touched objects is developed. To transfer tactile information extracted from tactile sensor arrays, a wearable vibrotactile feedback band with a spatial coding feedback strategy is implemented by selectively activating vibrotactile motors located on the skin of the upper arm. In a set of tests performed by an individual with transradial amputation and eight able-bodied subjects, the soft prosthetic hand integrated with tactile sensor arrays can help the users regain finger tactile sensation, discriminate grasped objects, and achieve real-time dynamic rolling detection.

TI Universal Prototype Transport for Zero-Shot Action Recognition and
   Localization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article
AB This work addresses the problem of recognizing action categories in videos when no training examples are available. The current state-of-the-art enables such a zero-shot recognition by learning universal mappings from videos to a semantic space, either trained on large-scale seen actions or on objects. While effective, we find that universal action and object mappings are biased to specific regions in the semantic space. These biases lead to a fundamental problem: many unseen action categories are simply never inferred during testing. For example on UCF-101, a quarter of the unseen actions are out of reach with a state-of-the-art universal action model. To that end, this paper introduces universal prototype transport for zero-shot action recognition. The main idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of unseen actions by matching them to the distribution of all test videos. For universal action models, we propose to match distributions through a hyperspherical optimal transport from unseen action prototypes to the set of all projected test videos. The resulting transport couplings in turn determine the target prototype for each unseen action. Rather than directly using the target prototype as final result, we re-position unseen action prototypes along the geodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes as a form of semantic regularization. For universal object models, we outline a variant that defines target prototypes based on an optimal transport between unseen action prototypes and object prototypes. Empirically, we show that universal prototype transport diminishes the biased selection of unseen action prototypes and boosts both universal action and object models for zero-shot classification and spatio-temporal localization.

AB In several previously published studies, Lavine and coworkers have demonstrated that infrared (IR) spectra from all layers of an intact multilayered automotive paint chip can be collected in a single analysis by scanning across each layer of a cross sectioned paint chip using a Fourier transform IR imaging microscope. Applying alternating least squares to the spectral data, the IR spectrum of each layer of an original equipment manufacturer paint chip can be extracted from a line map of the spectral image. To further develop this imaging technique for automotive paint analysis, the capability to cross section "small" paint chips (1 mm or less) using an ultramicrotome has been incorporated into our current imaging methodology. An ultramicrotome does not require epoxy or other embedding media for the paint chip and will simplify the analysis. However, extracting the IR spectra for each layer of an original equipment manufacturer paint chip by alternating least squares can be problematic for thin peels (less than one micron thickness), necessitating the use of target testing factor analysis to determine whether a specific layer is present in the line map and modified alternating least squares to recover the IR spectrum of the layer. Using a new sample preparation technique and the appropriate multivariate curve resolution methods, high quality IR spectra of the layers of a modern automotive paint system can be obtained from paint fragments that are smaller than what is practical to analyze by conventional Fourier transform IR spectroscopy.

TI A hierarchical sparrow search algorithm to solve numerical optimization

   search algorithm; Virtual individual strategy
AB The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is an efficient swarm-intelligence-based algorithm and has been widely studied in recent years. Nevertheless, as with other swarm intelligence optimization approaches, the SSA is prone to fall into local solutions, which weakens the exploration ability. In order to cope with this problem, in this paper, a novel hierarchical SSA, named the HSSA, is proposed. Specifically, by introducing the virtual individual strategy in each iteration, each scrounger can obtain more effective guidance information in the developed HSSA, thus contributing to a thorough search in the entire problem space. On the other hand, the proposed hierarchical strategy is employed to realize the information interaction among individuals according to the division layers (including top, medium and bottom layers) with the purpose of enhancing the diversity of the original SSA. In addition, the life cycle mechanism is introduced in order to avoid the current scrounger individuals being trapped in local optima positions as much as possible, which can further improve the solution accuracy of the traditional SSA. The developed HSSA is verified on a series of benchmark functions (i.e., IEEE CEC2022) and the parameter optimization problem of the carbon fiber drawing process. The proposed HSSA is compared with three classes of existing swarm-intelligence-based approaches: (1) CLSSA, C-SSA, and CSSA as popular SSA-based methods; (2) BWO, HGS, GJO, and DBO as state-of-the-art optimization techniques; and (3) GWO, WOA, HHO, MPA, WSO, and POA as highly-cited swarm intelligence algorithms. Results demonstrate that the HSSA exhibits the best performance among twelve test functions and one practical application in terms of solving accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, the overall experimental results indicate that the developed HSSA is an effective method to deal with the defects of the basic SSA and can obtain satisfactory solutions for different optimization problems.

AB Sustainable energy is the new normal towards saving the environment, thus resources generating sustainable green energy have gained global attention. Out of all the predominant sustainable energy genres, wind energy is one of the promising and growing solutions to improve efficiency towards sustainability. To expand the area of wind power generation and install more wind farms in future; accurate predictive analytics is mandatory. Due to uncertainty and stochastic nature of wind power time series parameters and outputs, enormous data driven; various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for the simulation and predictions for wind power predictive analytics. Many approaches have been working towards using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and its variants to improve accuracy in wind power predictions. With an aim of easing researchers and applications working in the field of wind power predictive analytics, this study strives to provide critical insights on usage LSTM and associated model in wind power predictions. This study explores at the root level; hence a survey is first made to understand and explore requirements and benefits of time series predictive analytics. Second, a generic exploration of all the different models and performance metrics used over different time series data is performed. Third, a thorough review on WP predictive analysis, based on LSTM as a whole or part of the model is presented. This will also include decomposition techniques, normalization methods, performance metrics, experimented datasets and dependent variable used for wind power predictive analytics. These approaches have been thoroughly seeking to improve the results; however certain challenges still persist due to variability and uncertain nature of wind parameters. Therefore, the major objective of presenting this paper is to learn (i) requirements and benefits of time series predictive analytics, (ii) state of art models and metrics used in time series predictive analytics, (iii) role of LSTM and associated models in wind power predictive analytics, (iv) different decomposition techniques, normalization methods, performance metrics, experimented datasets and predictive frequency used in wind power predictive analytics; and (v) challenges persisting in wind power predictive analytics and usage of LSTM.

AB Deep Learning (DL) has already shown tremendous potential in designing intelligent clinical support systems in biomedicine. Data privacy plays a significant role while training and testing DL models, especially for sensitive data. Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) applications in Healthcare are rapidly growing as medical informatics deals with sensitive data. This work reviews the recent advances in PPDL techniques in Healthcare. It first analyzes the need of PPDL in healthcare informatics using a threat model and then discusses privacy-preserving computation techniques for secure data processing and evaluation. Next, it focuses on DL applications over Healthcare in three categories: (i) PPDL in the private cloud, (ii) PPDL in the public cloud, and (iii) privacy based on modifications in DL architectures. Next, we examine data privacy at different stages of DL deployment in Healthcare, including input, model, training, and output. We also provide a summary of the evaluation outcomes of the solutions reviewed. Additionally, we highlight the unique challenges in PPDL for Healthcare and offer suggestions for future research directions.

AB Nature-Inspired Computing or NIC for short is a relatively young field that tries to discover fresh methods of computing by researching how natural phenomena function to find solutions to complicated issues in many contexts. As a consequence of this, ground-breaking research has been conducted in a variety of domains, including synthetic immune functions, neural networks, intelligence of swarm, as well as computing of evolutionary. In the domains of biology, physics, engineering, economics, and management, NIC techniques are used. In real-world classification, optimization, forecasting, and clustering, as well as engineering and science issues, meta-heuristics algorithms are successful, efficient, and resilient. There are two active NIC patterns: the gravitational search algorithm and the Krill herd algorithm. The study on using the Krill Herd Algorithm (KH) and the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in medicine and healthcare is given a worldwide and historical review in this publication. Comprehensive surveys have been conducted on some other nature-inspired algorithms, including KH and GSA. The various versions of the KH and GSA algorithms and their applications in healthcare are thoroughly reviewed in the present article. Nonetheless, no survey research on KH and GSA in the healthcare field has been undertaken. As a result, this work conducts a thorough review of KH and GSA to assist researchers in using them in diverse domains or hybridizing them with other popular algorithms. It also provides an in-depth examination of the KH and GSA in terms of application, modification, and hybridization. It is important to note that the goal of the study is to offer a viewpoint on GSA with KH, particularly for academics interested in investigating the capabilities and performance of the algorithm in the healthcare and medical domains.

AB Fundus image captures rear of an eye which has been studied for disease identification, classification, segmentation, generation, and biological traits association using handcrafted, conventional, and deep learning methods. In biological traits estimation, most of the studies have been carried out for the age prediction and gender classification with convincing results. The current study utilizes the cutting-edge deep learning (DL) algorithms to estimate biological traits in terms of age and gender together with associating traits to retinal visuals. For the trait's association, we embed aging as the label information into the proposed DL model to learn knowledge about the effected regions with aging. Our proposed DL models named FAG-Net and FGC-Net, which correspondingly estimates biological traits (age and gender) and generates fundus images. FAG-Net can generate multiple variants of an input fundus image given a list of ages as conditions. In this study, we analyzed fundus images and their corresponding association in terms of aging and gender. Our proposed models outperform randomly selected state-of-the-art DL models.

AB Traditional semantic-based focused crawlers calculate the topical priority of hyperlink by linearly integrating topical similarity evaluation metrics and empirical weights. However, the manually pre-determined weights may introduce bias in evaluating hyperlinks, resulting in topic deviation during crawling. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic adaptive procedure based on particle swarm optimization which dynamically updates weights in every crawling step and put forward a new focused crawler, called FCPSO. In FCPSO, we utilize domain ontology for topic representation and a comprehensive priority evaluation method to evaluate the topical priority of hyperlink. Furthermore, we construct a multi-objective optimization model for hyperlink selection, in which the strategy of the non-dominant sorting with the nearest farthest candidate solution is proposed to select Pareto-optimal hyperlinks and guide the crawling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FCPSO over other strategies that it can obtain more topic-relevant webpages with less time consumption.

AB As robots have become more pervasive in our daily life, natural human-robot interaction (HRI) has had a positive impact on the development of robotics. Thus, there has been growing interest in the development of vision-based hand gesture recognition for HRI to bridge human-robot barriers. The aim is for interaction with robots to be as natural as that between individuals. Accordingly, incorporating hand gestures in HRI is a significant research area. Hand gestures can provide natural, intuitive, and creative methods for communicating with robots. This paper provides an analysis of hand gesture recognition using both monocular cameras and RGB-D cameras for this purpose. Specifically, the main process of visual gesture recognition includes data acquisition, hand gesture detection and segmentation, feature extraction and gesture classification, which are discussed in this paper. Experimental evaluations are also reviewed. Furthermore, algorithms of hand gesture recognition for human-robot interaction are examined in this study. In addition, the advances required for improvement in the present hand gesture recognition systems, which can be applied for effective and efficient human-robot interaction, are discussed.

AB A good image editing model should learn to map the relationships between styles from different domains, cater to the high quality and diversity of the generated images, and be highly scalable across different domains. At the same time, given the importance of multi-device deployments, especially of models on lightweight devices, lightweight optimization of models is an essential and critical task. Based on these key points, a new approach to optimizing and improving existing base models, namely OMGD-StarGAN, is proposed by combining PatchGAN discriminators and DynamicD dynamic training strategies, ResNet style generators, and modulated convolution, based on online multi-granularity knowledge distillation algorithms and StarGAN v2. A comparison of various experiments is conducted, and the experimental results show that the proposed model reduces the computational cost while improving the quality and diversity of the generated images.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING

AB Service anomalies are difficult to locate accurately due to their propagation through service dependencies in microservice systems. Besides, the protection mechanisms are introduced into the microservice systems to ensure the stable operation of services. However, the existing approaches ignore the impact of protection mechanisms on the root cause localization of abnormal services. Specifically, the circuit breaking and rate limiting mechanisms can refuse service requests and thus change the way of anomaly propagation. Moreover, the different service request frequencies and latency make service dependencies change dynamically, resulting in the different probabilities of anomaly propagation among services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named MicroGBPM to locate the root cause of abnormal services. We model the anomaly propagation among services as a dynamically constructed service attributed graph with metrics and traces when a failure occurs. To eliminate the impact of the protection mechanisms, we design a two-stage dynamic calibration strategy to adjust the probability of anomaly propagation among services. Then, we propose a random walking approach to calculate the root cause results by using the PageRank algorithm. The experimental results show that MicroGBPM improves the accuracy of root cause localization compared to other approaches in the microservice systems with protection mechanisms.

ID MINIMUM SPANNING TREE
AB In real path selection decisions, besides the cost of the path which is the major decision factor, the chance of the path connection is also significant. A path which has low weight but low chance of existence is not a good choice for decision-making. In order to make network optimization more in line with the actual situation, this paper studies one model of it on a network whose existence and weight of edges are both indeterminate. The aim of this paper is to obtain a spanning tree which satisfies the connectivity constraint and minimizes the total weight as well. The study uses conditional uncertain variable to describe the relationship between these two aspects of uncertain variables. On this basis, three different models of the UMST problem are suggested, and the equivalence relation between the MST model of uncertain networks with uncertain edge existence and weight and the MST of related deterministic networks is found. Examples of experiments with specific numerical values are provided to verify the variation in the network when two variables are considered simultaneously.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant popularity through wearable technologies. Several IoT devices are used in educational institutions, smart homes, and security management. Their widespread use in sports training applications using IoT (WS-IoT)-based wearable sensors is noteworthy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly, and its applications have expanded across many diverse fields. Over the past few years, China has placed greater emphasis on physical education to enhance students' physical fitness and overall capabilities. A significant number of colleges and universities have adopted artificial intelligence to transform traditional single-mode sports training methods. This paper introduces a continuous monitoring system for sports individuals using the WS-IoT. The goal of coaches is to maximize the results of athlete training across various sports events using AI technology and their sports expertise. In this study, we examine the use of AI technology in sports and assess the practical implications of its implementation. To achieve the objective function, we used a Bayesian deep classifier and deep learning algorithms that utilize adaptive optimization. Utilizing artificial intelligence in Chinese educational institutions improves training efficiency and effectiveness. The system was then rigorously tested and analyzed in terms of the quality-of-service parameters, including communication collisions and packet loss rates. It is shown that packet loss rates increase with increasing packet numbers, but collision rates remain unchanged. Furthermore, a practical application of the system in colleges and universities showed that 14.4% of the students were extremely satisfied with the use of teaching materials, 24.5% were satisfied with the materials, 30.1% were satisfied with the training methods, and 17.9% were dissatisfied.

AB COVID-19 (Corona VIrus Disease-2019) is a virus spreading worldwide and became a global issue in March 2020. Over 33 million individuals have been infected with COVID-19, and above 1 million people have died due to this disease. However, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the primary diagnostic method for testing the cases worldwide, and there are better efficient ways to test COVID. In this research, a hybrid model is developed to detect and classify COVID-19 based on CT lung images. This hybrid model combines deep transfer learning (DTL), DenseNet-264, with an Alternating Decision Tree (AD-Tree). In this proposed model, the DenseNet-264 is used for the feature extraction, and AD-Tree is implemented for the classifications of COVID-infected lung images. Using the DTL model, the feature extraction process is performed, and based on the features extracted, the classification is carried out using the AD-Tree. Datasets collected from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) and Radiopaedia databases are used for the evaluation. For performance analysis, the data set is divided into 70% to train and 30% to test the model. This presented model achieved 97.40% accuracy, which is 1.15-6.5% improved than the other existing compared models such as VGG-16, ResNet 152v2, Inception ResNet, and DenseNet-201.

AB Relay node placement with a hop count bound is a crucial problem in enhancing connectivity, lifetime, and reliability in multi-hop wireless sensor networks. However, existing approaches focus solely on minimizing the number of used relay nodes without considering the energy consumption among nodes. This work investigates a relay node placement problem in multi-hop wireless sensor networks with two objectives: minimize the number of used relay nodes, and minimize the maximum node energy consumption to prolong the network's lifetime while still ensuring the network's connectivity. In particular, we consider a hop count bound as a delay constraint to elevate the network's reliability. We propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called GPrim to solve our problem. The algorithm is a combination of edge-set encoding and NSGA-II framework. Leveraging problem-specific properties, we introduce objective-oriented heuristics incorporated into initialization, crossover, and mutation operators to improve the algorithm's convergence. Simulation results on 3D datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than existing algorithms on all measured metrics.

AB An individual cannot depend on a single caregiver for the course of their entire lifespan. Each caregiver maintains several kinds of health records in various forms. There are differences in the formats, standards, nomenclature, and notation. The only way to fix this is by implementing semantic interoperability. There are precise and imprecise relationships (synonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and holonymy) among various terms used in healthcare. The intuitionistic fuzzy-based semantic interoperability paradigm is suggested in this article as a solution to this form of uncertainty. Protected health information, as defined by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, must be preserved for all medical records. To ensure privacy, AES and ElGamal encryption methods are used. The suggested solution performs better compared to existing semantic interoperability and privacy techniques.

AB Over the past few years, quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, as the forerunner of quantum evolutionary algorithms has made significant achievements in solving optimization problems in various fields. The ability of this algorithm to comprehensively search the problem space and discover global extrema is due to the power of the exploration process in this algorithm, which in turn is attributed to the mutations resulting from quantum rotation gates. But the best results in evolutionary algorithms are obtained when there is a reasonable balance between the exploration process (general search) and the exploitation process (local search). Under such conditions, the convergence speed of the algorithm in finding the global optima is no longer suppressed. In this research, a memetic quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which is a combination of a quantum genetic algorithm and a local search-based meta-heuristic called tabu search. In the proposed method, mutations of the rotation gate cover the entire problem space and access distant solutions. Consequently, the impulses generated by the tabu search in each iteration limit the range of motion and access to nearby solutions. Consecutive execution of these two processes turns the classical mutation operator into a directional mutation and accelerates the convergence of evolution. The evaluation results of this algorithm on unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions reflect the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rate and running time.

AB Fringe projection profilometry is widely used in 3D structured light due to its fast speed and accuracy. However, in the process of phase unwrapping, it is easy to cause invalid points in the edges and shadows of objects, which leads to error points in 3D reconstruction. To solve this problem, we propose an invalid points removal method based on Markov random fields. Specifically, the proposed method formulates unwrapped phase and mask maps as energy functions and uses iterative methods to minimize them. Furthermore, we validate the proposed method in a monocular structured light system and compare it with existing algorithms. Results show that the proposed method effectively identifies edges and shadows while preserving valid points, and has strong robustness and correctness.

AB In recent years, there have been several calls by practitioners of machine learning to provide more guidelines on how to use its methods and techniques. For example, the current literature on resampling methods is confusing and sometimes contradictory; worse, there are sometimes no practical guidelines offered at all. To address this shortcoming, a simulation study was conducted that evaluated ridge regression models fitted on five real-world datasets. The study compared the performance of four resampling methods, namely, Monte Carlo resampling, bootstrap, k-fold cross-validation, and repeated k-fold cross-validation. The goal was to find the best-fitting ? (regularization) parameter that would minimize mean squared error, by using nine variations of these resampling methods. For each of the nine resampling variations, 1,000 runs were performed to see how often a good fit, average fit, and poor fit ? value would be chosen. The resampling method that chose good fit values the greatest number of times was deemed the best method. Based on the results of the investigation, three general recommendations are made: (1) repeated k-fold cross-validation is the best method to select as a general-purpose resampling method; (2) k = 10 folds is a good choice in k-fold cross-validation; (3) Monte Carlo and bootstrap are underperformers, so they are not recommended as general-purpose resampling methods. At the same time, no resampling method was found to be uniformly better than the others.

AB Automated fraud detection can assist organisations to safeguard user accounts, a task that is very challenging due to the great sparsity of known fraud transactions. Many approaches in the literature focus on credit card fraud and ignore the growing field of online banking. However, there is a lack of publicly available data for both. The lack of publicly available data hinders the progress of the field and limits the investigation of potential solutions. With this work, we: (a) introduce FraudNLP, the first anonymised, publicly available dataset for online fraud detection, (b) benchmark machine and deep learning methods with multiple evaluation measures, (c) argue that online actions do follow rules similar to natural language and hence can be approached successfully by natural language processing methods.

AB This research considers observed migratory flows as a source of information for the preferences of individuals. Using data on global migration flows from 2005 onwards, the extent to which the structure of the international migration system is consistent with an implicit ranking of countries is examined. Moreover, by assuming that migrants' decision-making is guided by utility maximization, we interpret the scores of the ranking as a measure of subjective well-being or happiness. After this, the estimated scores are associated with a set of factors usually considered key drivers of happiness. Empirical results suggest that income is the most relevant predictor of happiness and this relationship is non-linear.

DE Human visual system; noisy leaf; classification and identification;
   information correlation de-noising
AB At present, some achievements have been made in the research of plant leaf classification such as the introduction of artificial intelligence algorithm. But there are still some problems. First, the existing achievements do not consider the subjective perception mechanism and role of human visual system in leaf classification data labels. Second, the implementation of the deep learning algorithm completely depends on the computing power level of the high-cost machine hardware and the large-scale image database. Finally, these research results rarely consider the noise pollution of leaf image samples. In order to solve the above problems, the paper fully considered the subjective perception principle and characteristics of human vision system (HVS), and proposed a lightweight classification method of noisy plant leaves (LCM-NPLs) based on visual domain perception. First, the most suitable HVS front-end perception characteristics were applied to the physical visual processing of leaves. Then the plant leaves were denoised through the information processing mechanism of HVS back-end. The visual effect of regular and orderly plant leaves is obtained. Finally, the classification is realized by principal component analysis (PCA) and third-order nearest neighbor algorithm. The results of ablation contrast experiments show that the classification accuracy of the method in this paper is 82.50% for plant leaves in the presence of serious noise interference with PSNR of 10.2421, more than 90% for plant leaves with general noise pollution transmission with PSNR of more than 15.3759, and 98.33% for plant leaves of light pollution with PSNR of 20.5659. The proposed method has achieved very good results. The proposed method can not only accurately classify plant leaves in different growth periods, but also maintain a high classification accuracy rate in the presence of serious noise interference.

AB With the development of simulation technology, more and more manufacturers have begun to use the digital twin to design workshops and factories. For these design scenarios under real-time interaction requirements with an excessive amount of model data, if the rendering is stuck, it will reduce the work efficiency. It is a key enabling technology to simplify and switch the geometry models with different resolutions, according to the distance of the viewpoint or the motion state to reduce the computational complexity. Existing model simplification methods emphasize the universality and efficiency under various scenarios, while the simplification performance in the 3D geometry models of industrial mechanisms is poor. This paper proposes a rapid simplification approach to the 3D geometry model of mechanisms in the digital twins-driven manufacturing system design context. A novel Vertex Saliency-oriented Classified Edge Collapse (VS-CEC) algorithm is proposed to simplify the shape feature of the 3D geometry model of mechanisms. It especially emphasizes solving the sharp shape preservation issues in the mechanical design scenario rather than a universal things design scenario. A vertex saliency factor is defined and integrated with the region boundary information obtained from the processing of detailed features to ensure visual fidelity as well as shape preservation such as sharp edges. Experiments show that this approach reduces the data model complexity more reasonably to speed up the rendering. It ensures that the digital twin model interacts quickly with the physical manufacturing system, and thus realizes the low-latency visual effect of cyber-physical synchronization.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenerative condition characterized by sharp cognitive decline with no confirmed effective treatment or cure. This makes it critically important to identify the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in its early stages before significant cognitive deterioration has taken hold and even before any brain morphology and neuropathology are noticeable. In this study, five different multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN), with different architectures, in search of an optimal model for predicting the cognitive test scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-CoG13) over a span of 60 months (5 years). The multimodal data utilized to train and test the proposed models were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study and includes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau and beta-amyloid, structural measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional and metabolic measures from positron emission tomography (PET), and cognitive scores from the neuropsychological tests (Cog). The models developed herein delve into two main issues: (1) application merits of single-task vs. multitask for predicting future cognitive scores and (2) whether time-varying input data are better suited than specific timepoints for optimizing prediction results. This model yields a high of 90.27% (SD = 1.36) prediction accuracy (correlation) at 6 months after the initial visit to a lower 79.91% (SD = 8.84) prediction accuracy at 60 months. The analysis provided is comprehensive as it determines the predictions at all other timepoints and all MDNN models include converters in the CN and MCI groups (CNc, MCIc) and all the unstable groups in the CN and MCI groups (CNun and MCIun) that reverted to CN from MCI and to MCI from AD, so as not to bias the results. The results show that the best performance is achieved by a multimodal combined single-task long short-term memory (LSTM) regressor with an input sequence length of 2 data points (2 visits, 6 months apart) augmented with a pretrained Neural Network Estimator to fill in for the missing values.

AB The increasing popularity of small drones has stressed the urgent need for an effective drone-oriented surveillance system that can work day and night. Herein, an acoustic and optical sensor-fusion-based system-termed multimodal unmanned aerial vehicle 3D trajectory exposure system (MUTES) is presented to detect and track drone targets. MUTES combines multiple sensor modules including microphone array, camera, and lidar. The 64-channel microphone array provides semispherical surveillance with high signal-to-noise ratio of sound source estimation, while the long-range lidar and the telephoto camera are capable of subsequent precise target localization in a narrower but higher definition field of view. MUTES employs a coarse-to-fine, passive-to-active localization strategy for wide-range detection (semispherical) and high-precision 3D tracking. To further increase the fidelity, an environmental denoising model is trained, which helps to select valid acoustic features from a drone target, thus overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional sound source localization approaches when facing noise interference. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor-fusion approach is validated through field experiments. To the best of the knowledge, MUTES provides the farthest detection range, highest 3D position accuracy, strong anti-interference capability, and acceptable cost for unverified drone intruders.

AB Technology has substantially transformed the way legal services operate in many different countries. With a large and complex collection of digitized legal documents, the judiciary system worldwide presents a promising scenario for the development of intelligent tools. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of organizing and summarizing the constantly growing collection of legal documents, uncovering hidden topics, or themes that later can support tasks such as legal case retrieval and legal judgment prediction. Our approach to this problem relies on topic discovery techniques combined with a variety of preprocessing techniques and learning-based vector representations of words, such as Doc2Vec and BERT-like models. The proposed method was validated using four different datasets composed of short and long legal documents in Brazilian Portuguese, from legal decisions to chapters in legal books. Analysis conducted by a team of legal specialists revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach to uncover unique and relevant topics from large collections of legal documents, serving many purposes, such as giving support to legal case retrieval tools and also providing the team of legal specialists with a tool that can accelerate their work of labeling/tagging legal documents.

AB Deep learning-based stereo matching methods have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, it is still a challenging task to achieve high accuracy in real time. In response to this challenge, we propose a Spatial Attention-Guided Upsampling network (SAGU-Net) for accurate and real-time stereo matching. First, a Spatial Attention-Guided Cost Volume Upsampling (SAG-CVU) module is proposed for upsampling the low-resolution cost volume, which calculates each upsampled matching cost as the sum of neighboring coarse costs under the guidance of spatial attention. Different from the recently popular coarse-to-fine (CTF) strategy that prefers upsampling the coarse disparity map, the low-resolution cost volume is upsampled by the SAG-CVU module which allows more raw information to propagate to subsequent procedures and can alleviate the problem of losing high-frequency information. To ensure fast running speed, a medium-resolution disparity map is directly regressed from the upsampled cost volume and then upsampled to full resolution with a Spatial Attention-Guided Disparity Map Upsampling (SAG-DMU) module. Unlike most CTF-based methods which usually build and aggregate narrow cost volumes iteratively until a full-resolution disparity map is obtained, the SAG-DMU module helps the proposed network avoid the iterative procedure to ensure fast running speed. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective gradient loss function that plays the role of a discontinuity-preserving regularizer, which further improves the overall accuracy, especially at depth discontinuities. These design choices lead to the proposed SAGU-Net which can obtain accurate results in real time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAGU-Net and its variants outperform not only state-of-the-art real-time networks but also many accuracy-oriented models on multiple datasets.

AB Facial pose variation presents a significant challenge to facial expression recognition (FER) in real-world applications. Significant bottlenecks exist in the field of multiview facial expression recognition (MFER) including a lack of high-quality MFER datasets, and the limited model robustness in real-world MFER scenarios. Therefore, this article first introduces a metahuman-based MFER dataset (MMED), which effectively addresses the issues of insufficient quantity and quality in existing datasets. Second, a conditional cascade VGG (ccVGG) model is proposed, which can adaptively adjust expression feature extraction based on the input image's pose information. Finally, a hybrid training and few-shot learning strategy are proposed that integrates our MMED dataset with a real-world dataset and quickly deploys it in real-world application scenarios using the proposed Meta-Dist few-shot learning method. Experiments on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Face (KDEF) dataset demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits improved robustness in multiview application scenarios and achieves a recognition accuracy improvement of 28.68% relative to the baseline. It demonstrates that the proposed MMED dataset can effectively improve the training efficiency of MFER models and facilitate easy deployment in real-world applications. This work provides a reliable dataset for the MFER studies and paves the way for robust FER in any view for real-world deployment.

AB Magnetic soft robots featuring untethered actuation and high mechanical compliance have promising applications ranging from bionics to biomedicine. However, their fixed magnetization profiles pose a challenge for adaptive shape transformation in unpredictable environments and dynamic tasks. Herein, a reprogrammable magnetic soft composite is reported by encapsulating magnetic neodymium-iron-boron microparticles with low melting alloy (LMA) and embedding them into the elastomer. Utilizing the phase transition of the LMA, the magnetic microparticles can be reoriented under an external magnetic field and they can be immobilized through LMA solidification, allowing the robot to obtain a new magnetization profile corresponding to its temporary shape. By changing the LMA composition, the robot with multiple programming temperatures can be fabricated and its local magnetization profiles can be selectively programmed in different temperature ranges. A bioinspired crawler with multimode locomotion, a reconfigurable robotic gripper capable of adaptable grasping, and reconfigurable electronic circuits are also demonstrated. This work may pave the way for the next-generation magnetic soft robots and reconfigurable devices.

AB Applying deformable transformer for dense video captioning has achieved great success recently. However, deformable transformer only explores local-perspective perception by attending to a small set of key sampling points, which will make the decoder short-sighted and generate semantically incoherent and contradictory dense captions for a long video. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Perspective Perception Network to improve this problem. We first introduce a hierarchical temporal-spatial summary method to generate global-perspective summary context for each decoder layer and avoid redundant information. Then our new designed multiperspective attention encourages the model to selectively incorporate the multi-perspective perception feature. Finally, we propose a novel multi-perspective generator to perform both multi-perspective feature fusion and caption generation. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms previously published methods and achieves a competitive performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2. The design of our model also shows the universality of other visual tasks that we obtain comparable results by applying our model for Object Detection and Paragraph Video Captioning.

DE Voxel-based soft robots; Neuroevolution; Spiking neural networks
AB Voxel-based soft robots (VSRs) are a type of modular robots composed by interconnected soft and deformable blocks, i.e., voxels. Thanks to the softness of their bodies, VSRs may exhibit rich dynamic behaviors. One open question is what type of neural controller is most suitable for a given morphology and sensory apparatus in a given environment. One observation is that artificial neural networks with state may be able to cope with the dynamical nature of VSR bodies and their morphological computation. In this work, we consider four types of controllers, i.e., multilayer perceptrons (MLPs, stateless), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) without homeostasis, and SNNs with homeostasis. We consider three robot morphologies tested for locomotion, where each morphology is investigated in simulation with three different types and number of sensors. Neural network controllers are optimized with neuroevolution, and the experimental results are compared in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization ability. In addition, we analyze the resulting behavior of the robots systematically. Our results show that RNNs are typically more effective while MLPs are often the weakest controllers, particularly for robots with few sensors. However, SNNs are more capable in terms of generalization and the mechanism of homeostasis is often beneficial. Finally, we show that RNNs and SNNs with homeostasis produce a more wide variety of behaviors.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB The store-and-forward traffic model is widely used because of its simplicity and reasonable comprehension. Its results determine the duration of the green light according to a preset cycle. This paper builds further on the currently existing model: it expands the definitional domain of the optimization problem by adding additional probabilistic requirements regarding the number of vehicles in a street segment between intersections controlled by traffic lights. The defined optimization problem minimizes the probability of increasing the number of vehicles in the considered transport network. A further extension of the store-and-forward model allows the control domain to contain both green lights and cycle durations. Such optimal control allows the achievement of additional objective functions such as minimizing the number of vehicles in the network and minimizing the total time spent through the network. The definition of this control problem is done through a bi-level hierarchical formalization involving the store-and-forward model. The derived extended models are numerically tested and compared with real cases, giving preference to the derived extensions of the classical store-and-forward model.

AB This paper studies the globally exponential synchronization (GES) of a class of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with switching topology involving impulse action. A novel state-dependent switching (SDS) approach to tune the switching topology of CDNs is designed based on the information of the node dynamics with impulses. Different from the traditional SDS results which are based on continuous state space, some sufficient conditions for network synchronization based on SDS are proposed in the framework of impulse action. A relationship between impulse action, the network structure, and switching topology is established, which is crucial to design the SDS law. Two different impulse actions on the network dynamics are fully considered in this paper, namely, stabilizing continuous dynamics with desynchronizing impulses and destabilizing continuous dynamics with synchronizing impulses. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB Adversarial training using empirical risk minimization (ERM) is the state-of-the-art method for defense against adversarial attacks, that is, against small additive adversarial perturbations applied to test data leading to misclassification. Despite being successful in practice, understanding the generalization properties of adversarial training in classification remains widely open. In this article, we take the first step in this direction by precisely characterizing the robustness of adversarial training in binary linear classification. Specifically, we consider the high-dimensional regime where the model dimension grows with the size of the training set at a constant ratio. Our results provide exact asymptotics for both standard and adversarial test errors under general lq-norm bounded perturbations (q = 1) in both discriminative binary models and generative Gaussian-mixture models with correlated features. We use our sharp error formulae to explain how the adversarial and standard errors depend upon the over-parameterization ratio, the data model, and the attack budget. Finally, by comparing with the robust Bayes estimator, our sharp asymptotics allow us to study the fundamental limits of adversarial training.

ID PAINTER CLASSIFICATION
AB The computational modeling and analysis of traditional Chinese painting rely heavily on cognitive classification based on visual perception. This approach is crucial for understanding and identifying artworks created by different artists. However, the effective integration of visual perception into artificial intelligence (AI) models remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the classification research of Chinese painting faces certain challenges, such as insufficient investigation into the specific characteristics of painting images for author classification and recognition. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called multi-channel color fusion network (MCCFNet), which aims to extract visual features from diverse color perspectives. By considering multiple color channels, MCCFNet enhances the ability of AI models to capture intricate details and nuances present in Chinese painting. To improve the performance of the DenseNet model, we introduce a regional weighted pooling (RWP) strategy specifically designed for the DenseNet169 architecture. This strategy enhances the extraction of highly discriminative features. In our experimental evaluation, we comprehensively compared the performance of our proposed MCCFNet model against six state-of-the-art models. The comparison was conducted on a dataset consisting of 2436 TCP samples, derived from the works of 10 renowned Chinese artists. The evaluation metrics employed for performance assessment were Top-1 Accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). The experimental results have shown that our proposed MCCFNet model significantly outperform all other benchmarking methods with the highest classification accuracy of 98.68%. Meanwhile, the classification accuracy of any deep learning models on TCP can be much improved when adopting our proposed framework.

AB Convolutional neural network, an optimization technique inspired by biological visual cortex, is widely used in pattern recognition, information processing, and other fields, and it has a good ability to solve nonlinear problems. However, there are some disadvantages, such as its uninterpretability, high computational cost, and GPU consumption, which make its structural design difficult. As a result, the existing neural networks require manual design by experts, and numerous experiments have been conducted to assess their effectiveness. In order to reduce the difficulty of designing neural networks manually, and to design more effective networks to solve problems, we propose a model for automatically seeking 3D fully convolutional network (AS-3DFCN) based on genetic algorithm. Firstly, we suggest an AS-3DFCN that defines the search space as a directed graph. Secondly, in order to improve the segmentation accuracy of our model for brain tumor images, the genetic algorithm is applied to search an ideal topology network. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using the MICCAI-BraTS2018-2020 public datasets. After comparing with other manually designed fully convolutional networks, our method outperforms many other advanced methods, with average Dice coefficients of 84.7, 83.1, and 83.3; average Hausdorff measures of 4.32, 4.88, and 13.5; and parameter quantities of only 5.34M. It has also shown that our model has fewer parameters, can automatically seek the optimum network topology, and can segment brain tumor images more accurately.

AB IntroductionIn urban road scenes, due to the small size of traffic signs and the large amount of surrounding interference information, current methods are difficult to achieve good detection results in the field of unmanned driving. MethodsTo address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes an improved E-YOLOv4-tiny based on the YOLOv4-tiny. Firstly, this article constructs an efficient layer aggregation lightweight block with deep separable convolutions to enhance the feature extraction ability of the backbone. Secondly, this paper presents a feature fusion refinement module aimed at fully integrating multi-scale features. Moreover, this module incorporates our proposed efficient coordinate attention for refining interference information during feature transfer. Finally, this article proposes an improved S-RFB to add contextual feature information to the network, further enhancing the accuracy of traffic sign detection. Results and discussionThe method in this paper is tested on the CCTSDB dataset and the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the original YOLOv4-tiny in traffic sign detection with 3.76% and 7.37% improvement in mAP, respectively, and 21% reduction in the number of parameters. Compared with other advanced methods, the method proposed in this paper achieves a better balance between accuracy, real-time performance, and the number of model parameters, which has better application value.

AB In this article, an adaptive tracking controller based on radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) is proposed for nonlinear plants with unmatched uncertainties and smooth reference signals. The concept of valid RBFNN adaptive control is introduced where all closed-loop arguments of the involved RBFNNs should always remain inside their corresponding compact sets. Considering the local approximation capacity of RBFNNs, validity requirements are necessary for ensuring reliable closed-loop approximation accuracy and stability. To obtain valid RBFNN adaptive controllers, a novel iterative design method is proposed and embedded into the traditional backstepping approach. In the initial iteration, an ideal RBFNN and its online estimated version are introduced in each step where the initial compact set guarantees the validity requirement for only a finite time interval. Then, by carefully investigating the dependence among different signals and introducing some auxiliary variables, the compact sets are redesigned for prolonging the time interval satisfying validity requirements to infinity as the iteration goes on. Consequently, a closed-loop system model can be formulated during the entire control process, which underlies a rigorous proof on closed-loop stability and some guidelines on practical implementation. Meanwhile, rigorous analysis from validity requirements reveals, for the first time, a new feature of RBFNN adaptive controllers in the presence of unmatched uncertainties: excessively large scales of RBFNNs in intermediate steps may impair the closed-loop performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the obtained results.

TI HATFNet: Hierarchical adaptive trident fusion network for RGBT tracking

DT Article
DE RGBT tracking; Hierarchical adaptive; Trident fusion; Attention
ID SIAMESE NETWORKS
AB In recent years, RGBT tracking has received more and more attention from researchers due to its great potential in handling complex scenes and working around the clock. However, the hierarchical and multimodal features are not fully exploited in the existing algorithms, which affects the accuracy and performance of tracking. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical adaptive trident fusion network (HATFNet) to solve this problem, which leverages the complementary advantages of both hierarchical and multimodal features to achieve robust RGBT tracking. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation structure that integrates features from different layers to exploit their complementarity. This structure first unifies the number of channels and resolutions of different layers and then performs adaptive aggregation by a hierarchical feature aggregation (HFA) module. In addition, we design a multimodal feature fusion to fuse two modality features according to the reliability of the modalities, which takes full advantage of the positive effect of high-quality modalities. Finally, a trident fusion structure is used to integrate three features (fused, RGB and thermal infrared features) to enrich the feature representation and enhance the complementary learning between modalities. The results of many experiments on two large-scale benchmark datasets show that HATFNet has significant superiority compared to other latest RGB-T and RGB tracking methods.

AB To deal with the inconsistency of the distribution of reference vectors (RVs) and the shape of Pareto front in decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, many literatures proposed to adjust RVs in evolutionary process. However, most of the existing algorithms adjust RVs either in each generation or at a fixed frequency, not considering the evolving information of the population. To tackle this issue, we propose a many-objective evolutionary algorithm with metric-based reference vector adjustment named MBRA. To adjust RVs periodically and conditionally, we use the improvement rate of convergence degree of subproblems computed through d(1) distance to reflect the whole convergence of the population. Only when the subproblems are considered convergent on the whole, are RVs allowed to be adjusted: delete the invalid RVs associated with no solutions and add new ones using the farthest solution in the subregion of the most crowded RVs for diversity. Besides, in mating selection and environmental selection, we adopt the sum of objectives and fitness-based sorting based on Ie+ as the secondary principles to promote convergence, respectively. Validated through extensive experiments, MBRA is effective and competitive on many-objective optimization problems, especially for problems with irregular Pareto fronts.

AB Task planning is a crucial component in facilitating robot multi-task manipulations. Language-based task planning methods offer practicality in receiving commands from humans in real-life scenarios and require only low-cost labeled data. However, existing methods often rely on sequence models for planning, which primarily focus on mapping language to sequences of sub-tasks while neglecting the knowledge about tasks and objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge based task planning approach called Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN). It is devised with a novel structure that combined GCN (Kipf and Welling in International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017) and LSTM (Hochreiter and chmidhuber in Neural Comput 9 (8): 1735-1780, 1997. https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735) which enables it to leverage knowledge graph data and historical predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the impressive task planning success rate of 95.7%, surpassing the best baseline method significantly, which achieves 78.7%. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of multi-task manipulation across a specific set of 20 tasks within a simulated environment. Notably, RGCN combined with pre-trained primitive tasks exhibits the highest success rate compared with state-of-art multi-task learning methods. Our method is proven to be significant for language-conditioned task planning and is qualified for instructing robots for multi-task manipulation.

AB Feature extraction is a key step for deep-learning-based point cloud registration. In the correspondence-free point cloud registration task, the previous work commonly aggregates deep information for global feature extraction and numerous shallow information which is positive to point cloud registration will be ignored with the deepening of the neural network. Shallow information tends to represent the structural information of the point cloud, while deep information tends to represent the semantic information of the point cloud. In addition, fusing information of different dimensions is conducive to making full use of shallow information. Inspired by this, we verify shallow information in the middle layers can bring a positive impact on the point cloud registration task. We design various architectures to combine shallow information and deep information to extract global features for point cloud registration. Experimental results on the ModelNet40 dataset illustrate that feature extractors that incorporate shallow information will bring positive performance.

AB This article investigates the event-driven finite-horizon optimal consensus control problem for multiagent systems with symmetric or asymmetric input constraints. Initially, in order to overcome the difficulty that the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is time-varying in finite-horizon optimal control, a single critic neural network (NN) with time-varying activation function is applied to obtain the approximate optimal control. Meanwhile, for minimizing the terminal error to satisfy the terminal constraint of the value function, an augmented error vector containing the Bellman residual and the terminal error is constructed to update the weight of the NN. Furthermore, an improved learning law is proposed, which relaxes the tricky persistence excitation condition and eliminates the requirement of initial stability control. Moreover, a specific algorithm is designed to update the historical dataset, which can effectively accelerate the convergence rate of network weight. In addition, to improve the utilization rate of the communication resource, an effective dynamic event-triggering mechanism (DETM) composed of dynamic threshold parameters (DTPs) and auxiliary dynamic variables (ADVs) is designed, which is more flexible compared with the ADV-based DETM or DTP-based DETM. Finally, to support the effectiveness of the proposed method and the superiority of the designed DETM, a simulation example is provided.

DE Deep neural network; House price prediction; House textual description
AB House price prediction is an important problem that could benefit home buyers and sellers. Traditional models for house price prediction use numerical attributes such as the number of rooms but disregard the house description text. The recent developments in text processing suggest these can be valuable attributes, which motivated us to use house descriptions. This paper focuses on the house asking/advertising price and studies the impact of using house description texts to predict the final house price. To achieve this, we collected a large and diverse set of attributes on house postings, including the house advertising price. Then, we compare the performance of three scenarios: using only the house description, only numeric attributes, or both. We processed the description text through three word embedding techniques: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT. Four regression algorithms are trained using only textual data, non-textual data, or both. Our results show that by using exclusively the description data with Word2Vec and a Deep Learning model, we can achieve good performance. However, the best overall performance is obtained when using both textual and non-textual features. An R-2 of 0.7904 is achieved by the deep learning model using only description data on the testing data. This clearly indicates that using the house description text alone is a strong predictor for the house price. However, when observing the RMSE on the test data, the best model was gradient boosting using both numeric and description data. Overall, we observe that combining the textual and non-textual features improves the learned model and provides performance benefits when compared against using only one of the feature types. We also provide a freely available application for house price prediction, which is solely based on a house text description and uses our final developed model with Word2Vec and Deep Learning to predict the house price.

AB To reliably and accurately classify complicated "big" datasets, machine learning models must be continually improved. This research proposes straightforward yet competitive neural networks for text classification, even though graph neural networks (GNN) have reignited interest in graph-based text classification models. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and their refined "fine-tuned" models (denoted as FT-CNN and FT-ANN) are the names given to our proposed models. The models presented in this paper demonstrate that our simple models like (CNN, ANN, FT-CNN, and FT-ANN) can perform better than more complex GNN ones such as (SGC, SSGC, and TextGCN) and are comparable to others (i.e., HyperGAT and Bert). The process of fine-tuning is also highly recommended because it improves the performance and reliability of models. The performance of our suggested models on five benchmark datasets (namely, Reuters (R8), R52, 20NewsGroup, Ohsumed, and Mr) is vividly illustrated. According to the experimental findings, on the majority of the target datasets, these models-especially those that have been fine-tuned-perform surprisingly better than SOTA approaches, including GNN-based models.

AB As deep reinforcement learning (RL)'s capabilities surpass traditional reinforcement learning, the community is working to make these black boxes less opaque. Explanations about algorithms' choices and strategies serve this purpose. However, information about RL algorithms' operations is not easily accessible. Our research aimed to extract such information, use it to build explanations, and test those explanations with users. For our user study, eight RL agents were trained using OpenAI baselines. Then, the HIGHLIGHTS-VIS algorithm was created by altering previous HIGHLIGHTS algorithms to collect data about the agents' interactions with the environment. The data were used to create explanations that were compared to previous works' video-based summaries in a user study. The between-subjects user study had participants answer questions about different agents. Participants were measured using both self-reported trust and performance on downstream tasks. Downstream tasks are tasks that a participant is more likely to do correctly with the information contained in the explanation. Collecting data about both trust and the utility of explanations allowed comparison and analysis of the explanations' effectiveness. Results showed that the alternative explanations built from the collected data led to more correct answers about the agents and their strategies. Additionally, explanations' utility depended on the context. Finally, users' reported trust in an explanation did not directly correlate to performance. These results suggest trust and effectiveness may need to be measured and calibrated separately in future examinations of explanations.

AB The investigation of how to accurately predict the sale price of houses is the main objective of our work. Accurate secondhand housing price appraisal is critical in secondhand housing deals, mortgages, and risk assessment. Due to the complex composition of real estate prices, the difficulty of obtaining data and the lack of effective algorithms, the accurate appraisal of housing prices is still a challenge. Based on the hedonic model, the anchoring effect is added to the structure and location characteristics in this work. The 2SFCA algorithm is introduced into the location feature index to filter the influence of the accessibility index. Our model was trained using a variety of machine learning models, such as linear regression and random forest, and the results were evaluated to determine a suitable algorithm for building a secondhand housing transaction price forecasting model. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of the price prediction model could be improved by adding the facility accessibility index, and when the anchoring effect is added to the price prediction model, the prediction accuracy of the model could increase to 0.89. In comparing the results of various machine learning algorithms, we found that the ETR, RFR, and GBR models had better prediction results, and the accuracy rate could reach 0.9. In the end, a case study in Shenzhen was utilized to show that our proposed framework for predicting the price of secondhand houses, which integrated behavioral economics, hedonic price theory, and machine learning algorithms, was practical and efficient and can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of the evaluation.

   Attention mechanism; Re-ranking; Spatiotemporal context modeling
AB Person re-identification (ReID) aims at identifying a person of interest (POI) across multiple non-overlapping cameras. The POI can be either in an image or in a video sequence. Factors such as occlusion, variable viewpoint, misalignment, unrestrained poses, background clutter are the major challenges in developing robust, person ReID models. To address these issues, an attention mechanism that comprises local part/region-aggregated feature representation learning is presented in this paper by incorporating long-range local and global context modeling. The part-aware local attention blocks are aggregated into the widely used modified pre-trained ResNet50 CNN architecture as a backbone employing two attention blocks, i.e., Spatio-Temporal Attention Module (STAM) and Channel Attention Module (CAM). The spatial attention block of STAM can learn contextual dependencies between different human body parts/regions like head, upper body, lower body, and shoes from a single frame. On the other hand, the temporal attention modality can learn temporal contextual dependencies of the same person's body parts across all video frames. Lastly, the channel-based attention modality, i.e., CAM, can model semantic connections between the channels of feature maps. These STAM and CAM blocks are combined sequentially to form a unified attention network named as Spatio-Temporal Channel Attention Network (STCANet) that will be able to learn both short-range and long-range global feature maps, respectively. Extensive experiments are carried out to study the effectiveness of STCANet on three image-based and two video-based benchmark datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, MSMT17, DukeMTC-VideoReID, and MARS. K-reciprocal re-ranking of gallery set is also applied in which the proposed network showed a significant improvement over these datasets in comparison with state of the art. Lastly, to study the generalizability of STCANet on unseen test instances, cross-validation on external cohorts is also applied that showed the robustness of the proposed model that can be easily deployed to the real world for practical applications.

AB This work investigates minimizing the makespan of multiple servers in the case of identical parallel processors. In the case of executing multiple tasks through several servers and each server has a fixed number of processors. The processors are generally composed of two processors (core duo) or four processors (quad). The meaningful format of the number of processors is 2k, and k & GE; 0. The problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan on 2k processors. This problem is identified as NP-hard one. A new network architecture is proposed based on the addition of server management. In addition, two novel algorithms are proposed to solve the addressed scheduling problems. The proposed algorithms are based on the decomposition of the main problem in several sub-problems that are applied to develop new heuristics. In each level of the generated tree, some results are saved and used to decompose the set of processes into subsets for the next level. The proposed methods are experimentally examined showing that the running time of the proposed heuristics is remarkably better than its best rival from the literature. The application of this method is devoted to the network case when there are several servers to be exploited. The experimental results show that in 87.9% of total instances, the most loaded and least loaded subset-sum heuristic (MLS) reaches the best solution. The best-proposed heuristic reaches in 87.4% of cases the optimal solution in an average time of 0.002 s compared with the best of the literature which reaches a solution in an average time of 1.307 s.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Path planning is a critical technology that could help mobile robots accomplish their tasks quickly. However, some path planning algorithms tend to fall into local optimum in complex environments. A path planning method using a modified Harris hawks optimization (MHHO) algorithm is proposed to address the problem and improve the path quality. The proposed method improves the performance of the algorithm through multiple strategies. A linear path strategy is employed in path planning, which could straighten the corner segments of the path, making the obtained path smooth and the path distance short. Then, to avoid getting into the local optimum, a local search update strategy is applied to the HHO algorithm. In addition, a nonlinear control strategy is also used to improve the convergence accuracy and convergence speed. The performance of the MHHO method was evaluated through multiple experiments in different environments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in path length and speed of convergence than the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA), and HHO algorithms.

AB The goal of dynamic community discovery is to quickly and accurately mine the network structure for individuals with similar attributes for classification. Correct classification can effectively help us screen out more desired results, and it also reveals the laws of dynamic network changes. We propose a dynamic community discovery algorithm, NOME, based on node occupancy assignment and multi-objective evolutionary clustering. NOME adopts the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm MOEA/D framework based on decomposition, which can simultaneously decompose the two objective functions of modularization and normalized mutual information into multiple single-objective problems. In this algorithm, we use a Physarum-based network model to initialize populations, and each population represents a group of community-divided solutions. The evolution of the population uses the crossover and mutation operations of the genome matrix. To make the population in the evolution process closer to a better community division result, we develop a new strategy for node occupancy assignment and cooperate with mutation operators, aiming at the boundary nodes in the connection between the community and the connection between communities, by calculating the comparison node. The occupancy rate of the community with the neighbor node, the node is assigned to the community with the highest occupancy rate, and the authenticity of the community division is improved. In addition, to select high-quality final solutions from candidate solutions, we use a rationalized selection strategy from the external population size to obtain better time costs through smaller snapshot quality loss. Finally, comparative experiments with other representative dynamic community detection algorithms on synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed method has a better balance between snapshot quality and time cost.

ID INTERSECTION; MODEL
AB Aiming to address the issue of assessing the effectiveness of target damage in air defense interception under projectile and target intersection, this paper proposes a novel target damage effectiveness assessment mathematical calculation method using an adaptive fuzzy neural network. The design and calculation methods introduce the target cabin's damage weight factor, the dispersion error and coverage density and fire density of warhead fragment, and the ratio of the number of warhead fragments to the cross-sectional area of the target as the primary damage factors, and we establish a new model for calculating the target damage efficiency using Takagi-Sugeno adaptive fuzzy neural network with the multiple damage factors. In the designed model, we take the characteristic parameters of warhead fragments formed by the projectile explosion as the sample data and learn the mapping relationship between damage factors and damage effect expressed by the system of fuzzy rule. Combined with the vulnerability weight and damage factors of the target, the fuzzy rule system is applied to predict and calculate the damage probability and damage effectiveness. In addition, we use shot-line technology to set up the intersection criterion between warhead fragments and target, analyze the coordinate relationship of the projectile explosion relative to the target based on the ground coordinate system, and derive the distribution density function of warhead fragment and research a calculation model for target damage probability with multiple vulnerable cabins. Finally, we use the established model to train, test, and calculate the data from the actual projectile and target intersection damage test and present the comparison results to other damage calculation methods. By calculation and comparative analysis, the results show the smaller the distance between projectile and target, as well as the smaller the average intersection angle, and the larger the weight coefficient of the warhead fragment covering the target cabin, the total target damage probability increases obviously. In the two experimental calculations, the target cabin with the largest weight coefficient was considered, and compared with the existing literature, the damage probability of the proposed calculation method was increased by 9.13% and 10.93%, respectively, and it is clear that the proposed target damage assessment method can effectively reflect the real target damage effectiveness in the state of projectile and target intersection.

AB Crowdsourced data streams are popular and extremely valuable in several domains, namely in tourism. Tourism crowdsourcing platforms rely on past tourist and business inputs to provide tailored recommendations to current users in real time. The continuous, open, dynamic and non-curated nature of the crowd-originated data demands specific stream mining techniques to support online profiling, recommendation, change detection and adaptation, explanation and evaluation. The sought techniques must, not only, continuously improve and adapt profiles and models; but must also be transparent, overcome biases, prioritize preferences, master huge data volumes and all in real time. This article surveys the state-of-art of adaptive and explainable stream recommendation, extends the taxonomy of explainable recommendations from the offline to the stream-based scenario, and identifies future research opportunities.

AB This work proposes a memory fusion controller design methodology for sampled-data control of fractional-order (FO) systems with sliding memory window. Composed of finite-dimensional previous inputs, the devised controller is capable of handling hereditary effect and meanwhile enabling pseudo state to satisfy general integer-order (IO) discrete plant at sampling instants. Additionally, the asymptotical stability of controller and sampling error are further guaranteed. The developed fusion controller provides an "out-of-the-box" method for users who are not familiar with FO calculus and significantly facilitates the corresponding analysis. The above mentioned approach is thereafter employed in a more sophisticated case, that is, the coordination control of FO multiagent systems (MASs) subjects to intermittent sampled-data transmission. It is proved that the achievement of consensus only relates to the connectivity of communication graph. Numerical results are presented finally to substantiate the proposed control strategy.

TI Granger Causal Inference Based on Dual Laplacian Distribution and Its

AB Granger causality-based effective brain connectivity provides a powerful tool to probe the neural mechanism for information processing and the potential features for brain computer interfaces. However, in real applications, traditional Granger causality is prone to the influence of outliers, such as inevitable ocular artifacts, resulting in unreasonable brain linkages and the failure to decipher inherent cognition states. In this work, motivated by constructing the sparse causality brain networks under the strong physiological outlier noise conditions, we proposed a dual Laplacian Granger causality analysis (DLap-GCA) by imposing Laplacian distributions on both model parameters and residuals. In essence, the first Laplacian assumption on residuals will resist the influence of outliers in electroencephalogram (EEG) on causality inference, and the second Laplacian assumption on model parameters will sparsely characterize the intrinsic interactions among multiple brain regions. Through simulation study, we quantitatively verified its effectiveness in suppressing the influence of complex outliers, the stable capacity for model estimation, and sparse network inference. The application to motor-imagery (MI) EEG further reveals that our method can effectively capture the inherent hemispheric lateralization of MI tasks with sparse patterns even under strong noise conditions. The MI classification based on the network features derived from the proposed approach shows higher accuracy than other existing traditional approaches, which is attributed to the discriminative network structures being captured in a timely manner by DLap-GCA even under the single-trial online condition. Basically, these results consistently show its robustness to the influence of complex outliers and the capability of characterizing representative brain networks for cognition information processing, which has the potential to offer reliable network structures for both cognitive studies and future brain-computer interface (BCI) realization.

AB This article studies the optimal synchronization of linear heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs) with partial unknown knowledge of the system dynamics. The object is to realize system synchronization as well as minimize the performance index of each agent. A framework of heterogeneous multiagent graphical games is formulated first. In the graphical games, it is proved that the optimal control policy relying on the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobian-Bellmen (HJB) equation is not only in Nash equilibrium, but also the best response to fixed control policies of its neighbors. To solve the optimal control policy and the minimum value of the performance index, a model-based policy iteration (PI) algorithm is proposed. Then, according to the model-based algorithm, a data-based off-policy integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm is put forward to handle the partially unknown system dynamics. Furthermore, a single-critic neural network (NN) structure is used to implement the data-based algorithm. Based on the data collected by the behavior policy of the data-based off-policy algorithm, the gradient descent method is used to train NNs to approach the ideal weights. In addition, it is proved that all the proposed algorithms are convergent, and the weight-tuning law of the single-critic NNs can promote optimal synchronization. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

AB The development of advanced information technologies are paving the digital transformation of manufacturing systems, of which Digital Twin-based manufacturing system (DTMS) has become a prevailing topic attracted ever-increasing concerns from both industry and academia. As a cutting-edge smart manufacturing system, DTMS can improve manufacturing accuracy and efficiency based on high fidelity simulation, near real-time monitoring and control in a cyber-physical integrated manner. However, the connotation and boundary of DTMS lack a clear definition and systematic analysis. Therefore, this paper reviews the existing Digital Twin reference models and implementation architectures on manufacturing system, and further proposes a reference model of DTMS. Based on it, the characteristics and operational mechanism of DTMS are analyzed from three perspectives: hierarchy, dimension, and scale. Specifically, the composition of DTMS is described from a multi-level perspective, the specific characteristics of the DTMS are analyzed from a multi-dimensional perspective, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of the DTMS under different application scenarios are depicted from a multi-scale perspective, respectively. At last, the potential research directions of DTMS are highlighted in terms of reusability, interpretability and adaptability. It is envisioned that this work can provide a clear understanding with insightful knowledge to attract more in-depth research of DTMS.

AB The autoclave curing process is an important step in composite parts production, in which a batch of parts is cured in an autoclave simultaneously by systematically changing the inner temperature and pressure. Typically, curing cycles have three main phases: heating, dwell, and cooling. During the heating phase, parts are heated until they reach a curing temperature. Due to factors such as positions of parts inside the autoclave and batch composition, it is often not possible for the parts to reach the curing temperature simultaneously. Parts that reach the curing temperature earlier than the others are overcured, which negatively affects their quality. Moreover, shorter curing cycles are preferred due to the savings in cost, energy, and time. This study addresses these two considerations with a unified approach that integrates two decision support methods: regression and optimization. In the first stage, we determine the factors affecting the time to reach the curing temperature and relate them using multiple linear regression models. In the second stage, we utilize the regression models of the first stage and determine efficient placements of the parts in the autoclave considering two objectives: minimization of the duration of the heating phase and the maximum time delay between parts in reaching the curing temperature. The former corresponds to increasing productivity and the latter corresponds to minimizing quality losses. We propose a biobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model together with its equivalent linear model to generate the efficient frontier. Additionally, to obtain solutions faster, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and its mechanisms that address the problem are proposed. The approach is applied on real cases in a composite factory. The estimates of the regression models are significantly close to the realizations, and considerable gains in both objectives are observed with the optimization tools.

AB Hepatitis B is a virus that attacks the liver and causes liver disease. This virus is a possibly deadly infection of liver. The Hepatitis infection mainly disturbs all the operations done by the liver. Moreover, this infection now becomes the world's most severe kind of virus among all Hepatitis as out of 12 individuals; one is resulted as positive for Hepatitis B disease globally. Hepatitis B is a short-term disease for few individuals. But, sometimes, for few patients, it will become a chronic as well as long-term disease. This severe infection will lead to various deadly diseases that can infect the liver of an individual completely. The most life-threatening disease caused by it is a chronic liver disease which further leads to cancer as well as cirrhosis, and as a result, the life of a patient will put at significant risk. Therefore, it is very crucial and become a necessity to detect or identify this Hepatitis B virus at the very first stage or at an introductory stage. By doing so, the life of an individual can be saved for good. The biomarkers are also used to identify this deadly infection of the liver. If this infection is not cured until six months, then it will become chronic. However, the treatment and diagnosis of this life-threatening disease is very expensive and can cause serious side effects. Hence, it is vital to develop a diagnostic system that reduces the cost of treatment and diagnosis.

AB At present, information technology and network technology have achieved a rapid development, which has a huge direct impact on the whole society and people's life, and human beings have just entered the information technology era and big data. The "Internet + " continues to penetrate into all walks of life, making online resources further enriched, especially during English teaching process in universities to further integrate online resources, through the networked learning mode, so that the learning effect is very significantly improved, so that the classroom teaching mode in the traditional sense is constantly expanded, so that online and offline are fully integrated to achieve greater benefits. The blended teaching mode effectively gathers the advantages of different learning theories through different technical means to complement the advantages of the face-to-face traditional classroom teaching mode and online learning to further enhance the learning effect of students. The online and offline blended teaching (OOBT) effect evaluation of college English courses is regarded as multiple attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, Firstly, the TFNSs is reviewed. Then, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic numbers grey relational analysis (TFNN-GRA) method is built for MADM based on the traditional GRA and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Finally, a numerical example of a hybrid online and offline teaching effectiveness assessment of college English courses is given and some decision comparisons are made to show some advantages of TFNN-GRA approach.

ID OPTIMAL TRANSPORT
AB Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization is largely adopted for solving problems where the inputs are in Euclidean spaces. In this paper we associate the inputs to discrete probability distributions which are elements of the probability simplex. To search in the new design space, we need a distance between distributions. The optimal transport distance (aka Wasserstein distance) is chosen due to its mathematical structure and the computational strategies enabled by it. Both the GP and the acquisition function is generalized to an acquisition functional over the probability simplex. To optimize this functional two methods are proposed, one based on auto differentiation and the other based on proximal-point algorithm and the gradient flow. Finally, we report a preliminary set of computational results on a class of problems whose dimension ranges from 5 to 100. These results show that embedding the Bayesian optimization process in the probability simplex enables an effective algorithm whose performance over standard Bayesian optimization improves with the increase of problem dimensionality.

TI TNSEIR: A SEIR pattern-based embedding approach for temporal network

LA English
DT Article
DE Temporal network embedding; SEIR pattern; Link vanishing; Network
   analysis and inference
AB Network embedding defines a set of techniques for learning the vector representations of nodes and links, which accurately encode the network in a low-dimensional space for computational network analysis. The states of a network evolution are multiple containing link emergence and vanishing. However, determining the topological change caused by link vanishing in the dynamic environment is difficult because most temporal network embedding methods are restricted by learning frameworks. For example, embedding methods based on graph neural networks and matrix factorization handle only link emergences. To identify the structural changes caused by both link appearance and link vanishing, this paper introduces a temporal network embedding approach named TNSEIR inspired by classical susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model of infectious diseases, which exploits the information of network structure and temporal evolution. The structural change after link disappearance is represented as the "recovered" state of SEIR. A new node pair connection ("infection") probability function is proposed for capturing the information of neighboring nodes and the effect of macro-temporal factor. The macro-temporal factor specifies the topological structure of each network snapshot and the "latency" information of node pairs, while "latency" is derived from the "exposed" state of SEIR. Through that, TNSEIR can accurately capture the long-distance connection trends of node pairs and thereby predict the evolution trend. Extensive experiments are performed on three real-world temporal networks. TNSEIR mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) autonomous-modeling embedding methods on network analysis and network inference tasks. The strength of TNSEIR is distinctly evidenced by its large improvement on the Wikipedia network, which contains both link appearances and disappearances.

AB Information granules are fundamental and effective constructs in human cognitive and decision-making activities. It is unavoidable to automatically describe and extract some valuable information from large-scale datasets. In this study, we suggest a data-adaptive information granulation method to reinforce the data description mechanisms. First, a dynamic programming-based attribute-value clustering method is proposed to adaptively partition the numeric attribute values to several optimal data fragments for different condition attributes. Then, some interval information granules are constructed from the clustered data fragments by the principle of justifiable granularity for some specific tasks in machine learning. Furthermore, we introduce the distributed implementation in the framework of Map-Reduce to overcome some restrictions in large-scale datasets. The experiments on several benchmark datasets are provided to demonstrate the adaptivity on different datasets and the feasibility in machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the distributed performance are tested on some artificial datasets.

DE Temporal knowledge forecasting; Time-aware relation representation; Path
   representation constraint
AB Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating temporal information to represent valid time. TKG reasoning involves inferring and predicting missing or future facts within various time intervals, and applications in critical domains include political event prediction and financial analysis. Current TKG reasoning methods rely on path-based or subgraph-based strategies to achieve enhanced interpretability. However, they mostly focus on entity interaction information within paths or subgraphs, and they fail to exploit the semantic and temporal information of relations during reasoning. To comprehensively utilize such information for refining the reasoning process, we propose a subgraph reasoning model based on time-aware relation representation (TiAR) for TKGs. TiAR learns the subgraph structures around query nodes and reasons on facts happening in future timestamps. It encodes the relation features by combining the temporal displacement values between events and extracts the semantic correlations between query and adjacency relations via an attention-based neighborhood feature aggregation module. TiAR extracts a query subgraph of interest by iteratively sampling and diffusing attention through the whole graph. In particular, TiAR includes a path constraint module to further capture the semantic correlations between the structural features of queries and subgraphs. Our evaluation conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that TiAR outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, indicating its effectiveness in achieving improved TKG reasoning. In particular, for the two large ICEWS05-15/18 datasets, our model yields better performance than the latest model. Moreover, The development of TKG reasoning methods is essential for improving the reliability and interpretability of models in such domains, and our work contributes to this area of research.

AB As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the face mask detection system has become an essential tool in containing the spread of the virus. However, our study has demonstrated that existing deep learning-based face mask detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can severely compromise their performance and lead to misclassification. This study investigates the robustness of three face mask detection models based on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNet-B2, against such attacks and propose a novel, more robust face mask detection algorithm that is resilient to adversarial attacks. We evaluated the models based on several performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, and then subjected them to two popular adversarial attack techniques: fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD). The results indicate that the adversarial attacks caused a substantial reduction in the accuracy of the models, with MobileNetV2 decreasing from 95.83-14.83% and 0% (under FGSM and PGD attacks, respectively), ResNet50 decreasing from 96.48-13.97% and 0% (under FGSM and PGD attacks, respectively), and EfficientNet-B2 decreasing from 95.56-15.53% and 0% (under FGSM and PGD attacks, respectively). Finally, we illustrated that the proposed robust algorithm enhanced the model's resistance to adversarial attacks. These findings highlight the urgent need to raise awareness about adversarial attacks targeting COVID-19 monitoring systems and urge proactive measures to safeguard healthcare systems from similar threats before practical deployment.

AB Ranking systems conceived on historical data are central to our societies. Given a set of applicants and the information as to whether a past-applicant should have been selected or not, the task of fairly ranking the applicants (either by humans or by computers) is critical to the success of any institution. These tasks are typically carried out using regression methods, and considering the impact of these selection processes on our lives, it is natural to expect various fairness guarantees. In this article, we assume that affirmative action is enforced and that the number of candidates to admit from each protected group is predetermined. We demonstrate that even with this safety-net, classical linear regression methods may increase discrimination in the selection process, reinforcing implicit biases against minorities, in particular by poorly ranking the top minority applicants. We show that this phenomenon is intrinsic to linear regression methods and may happen even if the sensitive attribute is explicitly part of the input, or if a linear regression is computed on each minority group individually. We show that to better rank applicants it might be needed to adapt the choice of the regression methods (linear, polynomial, etc.) to each minority group individually.

AB With the commitment to climate, globally many countries started reducing brownfield energy production and strongly opting towards green energy resources. However, the optimal allocation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in electrical distribution systems still pertains as a challenging issue to attain the maximum benefits. It happens due to the system's complex behaviour and inappropriate integration of DERs that adversely affects the distribution grid. In this work, we propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of DERs with vulnerable node identification in active electrical distribution networks. A failure or extreme event at the vulnerable node would interrupt the power flow in the distribution network. Also, the power variation in these vulnerable nodes would significantly affect the operation of other linked nodes. Thus, these nodes are found suitable for the optimal placement of DERs. We demonstrate the proposed data-driven approach on a standard IEEE-123 bus test feeder. Initially, we partitioned the distribution system into optimal microgrids using graph theory and graph neural network architecture. Further, using Granger causality analysis, we identified vulnerable nodes in the partitioned microgrid, suitable for DERs integration. The placement of DERs on the vulnerable nodes enhanced network resilience. Improvement in resilience is validated by computing the percolation threshold for the microgrid networks. The results show a 37% improvement in the resilience of the system due to the optimal allocation of DERs.

AB As an important identity authentication method, speaker verification (SV) has been widely used in many domains, e.g., mobile financials. At the same time, the existing SV systems are insecure under replay spoofing attacks. Toward a more secure and stable SV system, this article proposes a replay attack detection system based on deformable convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a time-frequency double-channel attention model. In DCNN, the positions of elements in the convolutional kernel are not fixed. Instead, they are modified by some trainable variable to help the model extract more useful local information from input spectrograms. Meanwhile, a time-frequency domino double-channel attention model is adopted to extract more effective distinctive features to collect valuable information for distinguishing genuine and replay speeches. Experimental results on ASVspoof 2019 dataset show that the proposed model can detect replay attacks accurately.

DE Drug repurposing; Graph-based representation; COVID-19; Knowledge graph
AB Drug repurposing is a technique for probing new usages of existing medicines, but its traditional methods, such as computational approaches, can be time-consuming and laborious. Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based representation in drug repurposing, encoding entities and relations to predict new connections and facilitate drug discovery. As COVID-19 has become a major public health concern, it is critical to establish an appropriate COVID-19 KG for drug repurposing to combat the spread of the virus. However, most publicly available COVID-19 KGs lack support for multi-relations and comprehensive entity types. Moreover, none of them originates from COVID-19-related drugs, making it challenging to identify effective treatments. To tackle these issues, we developed Drug-CoV, a drug-origin and multi-relational COVID-19 KG. We evaluated the quality of Drug-CoV by performing link prediction and comparing the results to another publicly available COVID-19 KG. Our results showed that Drug-CoV outperformed the comparing KG in predicting new links between entities. Overall, Drug-CoV represents a valuable resource for COVID-19 drug repurposing efforts and demonstrates the potential of KGs for facilitating drug discovery.

AB The COVID-19 epidemic accelerated the digital change of several services, including healthcare, and increased access to telemedicine. As a result, an increasing number of web tools were introduced to meet patient needs. A safe database can be created in the healthcare industry as a result of digital transformation. This database can be used to protect, store, and share private patient data with healthcare workers, labs, and medical specialists. Designing efficient decision-making tools for COVID-19 diagnostics is now possible thanks to recent developments in information technology and deep learning (DL) models. In this paper, a novel method for diagnosing COVID-19 using deep learning-enhanced eagle perching optimizer (DTH-EPODL) model is presented. With the help of the IoT and the presented DTH-EPODL model, patient information can be gathered and analysed for illness detection. The DTH-EPODL model uses the Gaussian filtering (GF) method to remove noise in the initial step. Additionally, MixNet, a deep convolutional neural network-based method, is used for feature extraction. Using the deep autoencoder (DAE) algorithm, COVID-19 detection and categorization are accomplished. Finally, the DAE approach's associated hyperparameters can be best adjusted using the EPO method, which enhances categorization results. Benchmark chest x-ray datasets can be used to evaluate the experimental validity of the DTH-EPODL method. The experimental results showed that the DTH-EPODL technique outperformed more modern methods.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access

   Transformer; Video understanding
AB Due to redundancy in the spatiotemporal neighborhood and the global dependency between video frames, video recognition remains a challenge. Some prior works have been mainly driven by 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or 2D CNNs with a well-designed module for temporal information. However, convolution-based networks lack the capability to capture the global dependency due to the limited receptive field. Alternatively, transformer for video recognition is proposed to build long-range dependency between frame patches. Nevertheless, most transformer-based networks have significant computational costs because attention is calculated among all the tokens. Based on these observations, we propose an efficient network which we dub LGANet. Unlike conventional CNNs and transformers for video recognition, the LGANet can tackle both spatiotemporal redundancy and dependency by learning local and global token affinity in shallow and deep layers, respectively . Specifically, local attention is implemented in the shallow layers to reduce parameters and eliminate redundancy. In the deep layers, spatial-wise and channel-wise self-attention are embedded to realize the global dependency of high-level features. Moreover, several key designs are made in the multi-head self-attention (MSA) and feed-forward network (FFN). Extensive experiments are conducted on the popular video benchmarks, such as Kinetics-400, Something-Something V1 & V2. Without any bells and whistles, the LGANet achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released soon.

AB A number of articles are increasingly raising awareness on the different uses of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for customers and businesses. Many authors discuss about their benefits and possible challenges. However, for the time being, there is still limited research focused on AI principles and regulatory guidelines for the developers of expert systems like machine learning (ML) and/or deep learning (DL) technologies. This research addresses this knowledge gap in the academic literature. The objectives of this contribution are threefold: (i) It describes AI governance frameworks that were put forward by technology conglomerates, policy makers and by intergovernmental organizations, (ii) It sheds light on the extant literature on 'AI governance' as well as on the intersection of 'AI' and 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR), (iii) It identifies key dimensions of AI governance, and elaborates about the promotion of accountability and transparency; explainability, interpretability and reproducibility; fairness and inclusiveness; privacy and safety of end users, as well as on the prevention of risks and of cyber security issues from AI systems. This research implies that all those who are involved in the research, development and maintenance of AI systems, have social and ethical responsibilities to bear toward their consumers as well as to other stakeholders in society.

AB The growth of music streaming market is expected to be boosted by the rising use of smart devices and the streaming platforms in the forecast period. Music recommendation systems for groups have been intensively studied as the application scenario becomes more dynamic, where different kinds of group formulations lead to different levels of similarity in music tastes. This paper proposes a music recommendation framework to generate a Top-N list in high-similar, high-dissimilar, and regular groups. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the recommendation system in a wide range of aspects, including precision, ranking quality, and novelty. Based on the listening frequency of each user and for each track, implicit feedback is also derived from the track popularity. To prevent popularity bias, we combine track popularity and group popularity into latent factor models to improve the performance of the recommendation algorithm. As a result of our evaluation, we found that the proposed methods provided excellent recommendations regarding accuracy, diversity, and novelty.

ID SELECTION
AB Symbolic regression (SR) can be utilized to unveil the underlying mathematical expressions that de-scribe a given set of observed data. At present, SR can be categorized into two methods: learning-from-scratch and learning-with-experience. Compared to learning-from-scratch, learning-with-experience yields results that are comparable to those of several benchmarks and incurs significantly lower time costs for obtaining expressions. However, the learning-with-experience model performs poorly in terms of unseen data distributions and lacks a rectification tool, apart from constant optimization, which exhibits limited performance. In this study, we propose a Symbolic Network-based Rectifiable Learning Framework (SNR) that possesses the ability to correct errors. SNR adopts Symbolic Network (SymNet) to represent an expression, and the encoding of SymNet is designed to provide supervised information, with numerous self-generated expressions, to train a policy net (PolicyNet). The training of PolicyNet can offer prior knowledge to guide effective searches. Subsequently, the incorrectly predicted expressions are revised via a rectification mechanism. This rectification mechanism endows SNR with broader applicability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest averaged coefficient of determination on self-generated datasets when compared with other state-of-the-art methods and yields more accurate results in public datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Early fault detection, both in equipment and the products in process, is of paramount importance in industrial processes to ensure the quality of the final product, avoid abnormal operating conditions, expensive repairs, and even production process shutdown. The growing complexity of industrial systems and the increase in the amount of available data have encouraged the development of intelligent systems for automatic fault prediction/detection, mainly based on Industry 4.0 technologies and, particularly, those based on deep learning methodologies. However, the vast majority of proposals and research carried out to date define specific solutions for specific cases, which still requires a high level of expert knowledge for scaling the solutions to industrial environments. Actually, one of the major issues towards the industrialization of deep learning solutions is the determination of the optimal, or near-optimal, hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose a low-level set-up effort intelligent failure detection system that integrates deep neural networks with a Bayesian Optimization algorithm for self-tuning of the system hyper-parameters. In addition, to facilitate the industrialization of the proposal and its incorporation into current industrial systems, we embedded the proposal in our previously formulated and tested Simulai architecture which allows for containing and interaction with multiple and heterogeneous technological components of manufacturing processes. Finally, our proposal is tested in two real cases of a different nature. The obtained results show a successful performance and demonstrate the easy online integration and interaction in a real production system.

TI Federated benchmarking of medical artificial intelligence with MedPerf
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has tremendous potential to advance healthcare by supporting and contributing to the evidence-based practice of medicine, personalizing patient treatment, reducing costs, and improving both healthcare provider and patient experience. Unlocking this potential requires systematic, quantitative evaluation of the performance of medical AI models on large-scale, heterogeneous data capturing diverse patient populations. Here, to meet this need, we introduce MedPerf, an open platform for benchmarking AI models in the medical domain. MedPerf focuses on enabling federated evaluation of AI models, by securely distributing them to different facilities, such as healthcare organizations. This process of bringing the model to the data empowers each facility to assess and verify the performance of AI models in an efficient and human-supervised process, while prioritizing privacy. We describe the current challenges healthcare and AI communities face, the need for an open platform, the design philosophy of MedPerf, its current implementation status and real-world deployment, our roadmap and, importantly, the use of MedPerf with multiple international institutions within cloud-based technology and on-premises scenarios. Finally, we welcome new contributions by researchers and organizations to further strengthen MedPerf as an open benchmarking platform.
   Federated learning can be used to train medical AI models on sensitive personal data while preserving important privacy properties; however, the sensitive nature of the data makes it difficult to evaluate approaches reproducibly on real data. The MedPerf project presented by Karargyris et al. provides the tools and infrastructure to distribute models to healthcare facilities, such that they can be trained and evaluated in realistic settings.

TI Encoding physics to learn reaction-diffusion processes
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; DEEP
AB Modelling complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems, such as reaction-diffusion processes, which can be found in many fundamental dynamical effects in various disciplines, has largely relied on finding the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). However, predicting the evolution of these systems remains a challenging task for many cases owing to insufficient prior knowledge and a lack of explicit PDE formulation for describing the nonlinear process of the system variables. With recent data-driven approaches, it is possible to learn from measurement data while adding prior physics knowledge. However, existing physics-informed machine learning paradigms impose physics laws through soft penalty constraints, and the solution quality largely depends on a trial-and-error proper setting of hyperparameters. Here we propose a deep learning framework that forcibly encodes a given physics structure in a recurrent convolutional neural network to facilitate learning of the spatiotemporal dynamics in sparse data regimes. We show with extensive numerical experiments how the proposed approach can be applied to a variety of problems regarding reaction-diffusion processes and other PDE systems, including forward and inverse analysis, data-driven modelling and discovery of PDEs. We find that our physics-encoding machine learning approach shows high accuracy, robustness, interpretability and generalizability.
   Reaction-diffusion processes, which can be found in many fundamental spatiotemporal dynamical phenomena in chemistry, biology, geology, physics and ecology, can be modelled by partial differential equations (PDEs). Physics-informed deep learning approaches can accelerate the discovery of PDEs and Rao et al. improve interpretability and generalizability by strong encoding of the underlying physics structure in the neural network.

TI Hypergraph factorization for multi-tissue gene expression imputation
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID C/EBP FAMILY; TRANSCRIPTION; BLOOD
AB Integrating gene expression across tissues is crucial for understanding coordinated biological mechanisms. Vinas et al. present a neural network for multi-tissue imputation of gene expression, exploiting the shared regulatory architecture of tissues.
   Integrating gene expression across tissues and cell types is crucial for understanding the coordinated biological mechanisms that drive disease and characterize homoeostasis. However, traditional multi-tissue integration methods either cannot handle uncollected tissues or rely on genotype information, which is often unavailable and subject to privacy concerns. Here we present HYFA (hypergraph factorization), a parameter-efficient graph representation learning approach for joint imputation of multi-tissue and cell-type gene expression. HYFA is genotype agnostic, supports a variable number of collected tissues per individual, and imposes strong inductive biases to leverage the shared regulatory architecture of tissues and genes. In performance comparison on Genotype-Tissue Expression project data, HYFA achieves superior performance over existing methods, especially when multiple reference tissues are available. The HYFA-imputed dataset can be used to identify replicable regulatory genetic variations (expression quantitative trait loci), with substantial gains over the original incomplete dataset. HYFA can accelerate the effective and scalable integration of tissue and cell-type transcriptome biorepositories.

DE Knowledge graph; Maintenance; RDF
AB Enterprise RDF knowledge graphs are often built using extraction data pipelines that are fed by several heterogeneous sources (relational databases, CSV files or even unstructured textual data). As a direct consequence, the construction of these KGs undergoes a number of changes in the early stages of their life cycle, which are initiated by a human developer and therefore need to be done interactively and efficiently. Driven by such needs, in this paper, we present a solution for the incremental maintenance of KGs given user-prescribed changes. A key feature of the proposed solution is the support of provenance collection that can be used to assist the developer in the analysis and debugging of the KG. Specifically, we strive to compute and maintain the provenance of asserted and inferred facts in the knowledge graph incrementally (and thus efficiently). The evaluation exercises we have conducted show the effectiveness of our solution and highlight the parameters that impact performance. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   interaction
AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) is a crucial technique utilized in various scenarios of geoscience and remote sensing. Despite the remarkable success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in optical vision tasks, the application of CNNs in SAR ATR is still a challenging area due to the significant differences in the imaging mechanisms of SAR and optical images. This paper analytically addresses the cognitive gap of CNNs between optical and SAR images by leveraging multi order interactions to measure their representation capacity. Furthermore, we propose a subjective evaluation strategy to compare human interactions with those of CNNs. Our findings reveal that CNNs operate differently for optical and SAR images. Specifically, for SAR images, CNNs' representation capacity is comparable to that of humans, as they can encode intermediate interactions better than simple and complex ones. In contrast, for optical images, CNNs excel at encoding simple and complex interactions, but not intermediate interactions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbine (WT) has been increasingly adopted for its fault diagnosis and maintenance decision-making. However, the data collected in CM is typically noisy, multidimensional, and highly nonlinear, which causes significant challenges in achieving the effective CM of WT. This paper proposes a novel CM method using a deep learning model with temporal pattern attention (TPA) and a dynamic kernel principal components Mahalanobis distance (DKPMD). The method can evaluate the WT performance accurately for detecting faults. First, outliers are recognized and removed using isolation forest improved by sparse autoencoder and fuzzy c-means clustering (FSIF) from raw wind turbine data of health state for enhancing the quality and reliability of data in modeling. Then, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) is developed for data reconstruction of the objective variables using LassoNet and TPA, which can capture the short-and long-term temporal relationships under different time steps based on selected variables. Meanwhile, kernel RMSE (KRMSE) is applied as a loss function, which avoids the negative effects of large reconstructed errors in parameter optimization. A condition index (CI) is constructed using DKPMD based on the reconstructed errors to consider the dynamic correlation between the variables. Finally, a delay perception-based IF(DPIF) utilized to determine the threshold. Experiments with data from real WT demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach in detecting early abnormal conditions, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

TI An Envelope Operator for Full Convexity to Define Polyhedral Models in
   Digital Spaces
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION
LA English
DT Article
DE Digital geometry; Digital convexity; Full convexity; Polyhedral model;
   Envelope operator
AB In a recent work, full convexity has been proposed as an alternative definition of digital convexity. It solves many problems related to its usual definitions, for instance: Fully convex sets are digitally convex in the usual sense, but are also connected and simply connected. However, full convexity is not a monotone property; hence, intersections of fully convex sets may be neither fully convex nor connected. This defect might forbid digital polyhedral models with fully convex faces and edges. This can be detrimental since classical standard and naive planes are fully convex. In this paper, we study several methods that builds a fully convex set from a digital set. One is particularly appealing and is based on an iterative process: This envelope operator solves in arbitrary dimension the problem of extending a digital set into a fully convex set, while leaving fully convex sets invariant. This extension naturally leads to digital polyhedra whose cells are fully convex. Then a relative envelope operator is proposed, which can be used to force digital planarity of fully convex sets. We provide experiments showing that our method produces coherent polyhedral models for any polyhedron in arbitrary dimension. Finally we study how we can speed up full convexity checks and envelope operations, with a worst-case complexity lowered by a factor 2d in Z(d).

ID COMPLEXES
AB As opposed to the 3D cubic grid, the body-centered cubic (BCC) grid has some favorable topological properties: each set of voxels in the grid is a 3-manifold, with 2-manifold boundary. Thus, the Euler characteristic of an object O in this grid can be computed as half of the Euler characteristic of its boundary 8 O. We propose three new algorithms to compute the Euler characteristic in the BCC grid with this surface-based approach: one based on (critical point) Morse theory and two based on the discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We provide a comparison between the three new algorithms and the classic approach based on counting the number of cells, either of the 3D object or of its 2D boundary surface.

AB This paper examines a three-component differential equation model with a self-control mechanism in vision as a slight extension of the lateral inhibition model proposed by Peskin (Partial differential equations in biology: Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Lecture Notes, New York, 1976). First, we derive a condition under which the exact solution of our differential equationmodel for time-dependent input I = I (t) is described by the convolution integralwith a temporal biphasic function. Second, we analyze themodel with the input signal I = I (t, x) depending on time t and position x is an element of R, and we prove that the solution can be represented in convolution integral form and that t(1) > 0 exists such that the spatiotemporal integral kernel K-u(t(1), x) is positive for x is an element of R and t is an element of (0, t(1)). Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that there exists t(2)(> t(1)) such that K-u(t(2), x) includes the Mexican-hat function and a temporal biphasic function under certain parameter conditions. From these mathematical and numerical results, we find that there is a time lag before the Mexican-hat function appears in K-u(t, x), and the shape of K-u(t, x) is similar to the receptive field structure observed in experiments in the field of neurophysiology. We conclude that the partial differential equations for visual information processing can be used to analytically determine the shape of the spatiotemporal kernel indicating the self-control mechanism.

AB Background: In today's digital economy, enterprises are adopting collaboration software to facilitate digital transformation. However, if employees are not satisfied with the collaboration software, it can hinder enterprises from achieving the expected benefits. Although existing literature has contributed to user satisfaction after the introduction of collaboration software, there are gaps in predicting user satisfaction before its implementation. To address this gap, this study offers a machine learningbased forecasting method.Methods: We utilized national public data provided by the national information society agency of South Korea. To enable the data to be used in a machine learningbased binary classifier, we discretized the predictor variable. We then validated the effectiveness of our prediction model by calculating feature importance scores and prediction accuracy.Results: We identified 10 key factors that can predict user satisfaction. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that the naive Bayes (NB) classifier achieved the highest prediction accuracy rate of 0.780, followed by logistic regression (LR) at 0.767, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) at 0.744, support vector machine (SVM) at 0.744, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) at 0.707, and decision tree (DT) at 0.637. Conclusions: This research identifies essential indicators that can predict user satisfaction with collaboration software across four levels: institutional guidance, information and communication technology (ICT) environment, company culture, and demographics. Enterprises can use this information to evaluate their current collaboration status and develop strategies for introducing collaboration software. Furthermore, this study presents a novel approach to predicting user satisfaction and confirm the effectiveness of the machine learning-based prediction method proposed in this study, adding to the existing knowledge on the subject.

AB Purpose. To compare the diagnostic efficiencies of deep learning single-modal and multi-modal for the classification of benign and malignant breast mass lesions. Methods. We retrospectively collected data from 203 patients (207 lesions, 101 benign and 106 malignant) with breast tumors who underwent breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and October 2020. Mass segmentation was performed based on the three dimensions-region of interest (3D-ROI) minimum bounding cube at the edge of the lesion. We established single modal models based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) including T2WI and non-fs T1WI, the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) first phase was pre-contrast T1WI (d1), and Phases 2, 4, and 6 were post-contrast T1WI (d2, d4, d6); and Multi modal fusion models with a Sobel operator (four_mods:T2WI, non-fs-T1WI, d1, d2). Training set (n = 145), validation set (n = 22), and test set (n = 40). Five-fold cross validation was performed. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used as evaluation indicators. Delong's test compared the diagnostic performance of the multi-modal and single-modal models. Results. All models showed good performance, and the AUC values were all greater than 0.750. Among the single-modal models, T2WI, non-fs-T1WI, d1, and d2 had specificities of 77.1%, 77.2%, 80.2%, and 78.2%, respectively. d2 had the highest accuracy of 78.5% and showed the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.827. The multi-modal model with the Sobel operator performed better than single-modal models, with an AUC of 0.887, sensitivity of 79.8%, specificity of 86.1%, and positive prediction value of 85.6%. Delong's test showed that the diagnostic performance of the multi-modal fusion models was higher than that of the six single-modal models (T2WI, non-fs-T1WI, d1, d2, d4, d6); the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.043, 0.017, 0.006, 0.017, 0.020, 0.004, all were greater than 0.05). Conclusions. Multi-modal fusion deep learning models with a Sobel operator had excellent diagnostic value in the classification of breast masses, and further increase the efficiency of diagnosis.

AB Relationship extraction is one of the important tasks of constructing knowledge graph. In recent years, many scholars have introduced external information other than entities into relationship extraction models, which perform better than traditional relationship extraction methods. However, they ignore the importance of the relative position between entities. Considering the relative position between entity pairs and the influence of sentence level information on the performance of relationship extraction model, this article proposes a BERT-PAGG relationship extraction model. The model introduces the location information of entities, and combines the local features extracted by PAGG module with the entity vector representation output by BERT. Specifically, BERT-PAGG integrates entity location information into local features through segmented convolution neural network, uses attention mechanism to capture more effective semantic features, and finally regulates the transmission of information flow through gating mechanism. Experimental results on two open Chinese relation extraction datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best results compared with other models. At the same time, ablation experiments show that PAGG module can effectively use external information, and the introduction of this module makes the Macro-F1 value of the model increase by at least 2.82%.

AB Efficient compression of color point clouds (CPC) is crucial for immersive visual systems. The G-PCC standard by Moving Picture Experts Group offers effective compression solutions for static CPCs. G-PCC Trisoup, one of the G-PCC solutions, achieves high coding performance using a pruned octree, combined with triangle soup (trisoup) surface encoding. However, encoding errors introduce distortions like triangular holes, degrading visual quality. This article proposes a multi-view projection based joint geometry and color hole repairing method for G-PCC trisoup encoded color point cloud, significantly improving reconstruction quality. Firstly, a G-PCC Trisoup encoded CPC is projected onto multi-view color and geometry maps. A multi-view projection-based scheme detects triangular holes by identifying geometry discontinuities. A geometric weighting factor, considering direction, distance, and level set distance, repairs geometry maps. Additionally, a novel gated hole repairing network repairs color maps by leveraging semantic information and reducing background interference. Finally, the joint geometry and color repaired results are inversely projected to obtain the final CPCs. The proposed method is validated on distorted CPCs encoded with G-PCC Trisoup at different levels. Experimental results demonstrate effective improvement in geometry and color objective quality, leading to enhanced visual perception.

TI Value Functions Factorization With Latent State Information Sharing in
   Decentralized Multi-Agent Policy Gradients
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Machine learning; reinforcement learning; multi-agent systems
ID LEVEL
AB The use of centralized training and decentralized execution for value function factorization demonstrates the potential for addressing cooperative multi-agent reinforcement tasks. QMIX, one of the methods in this field, has emerged as the leading approach and showed superior performance on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark. Nonetheless, its monotonic mixing method of combining per-agent estimates in QMIX has limitations in representing joint action Q-values and may not provide enough global state information for accurately estimating single-agent value function, which can lead to suboptimal results. To this end, we present LSF-SAC, a novel framework that features a variational inference-based information-sharing mechanism as extra state information to assist individual agents in the value function factorization. We demonstrate that such latent individual state information sharing can significantly expand the power of value function factorization, while fully decentralized execution can still be maintained in LSF-SAC through a soft-actor-critic design. We evaluate LSF-SAC on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and demonstrate that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in challenging collaborative tasks. We further set extensive ablation studies for locating the key factors accounting for its performance improvements. We believe that this new insight can lead to new local value estimation methods and variational deep learning algorithms.

AB With the development of image style transfer technologies, portrait style transfer has attracted growing attention in this research community. In this article, we present an asymmetric double-stream generative adversarial network (ADS-GAN) to solve the problems that caused by cartoonization and other style transfer techniques when they are applied to portrait photos, such as facial deformation, contours missing, and stiff lines. By observing the characteristics between source and target images, we propose an edge contour retention (ECR) regularized loss to constrain the local and global contours of generated portrait images to avoid the portrait deformation. In addition, a content-style feature fusion module is introduced for further learning of the target image style, which uses a style attention mechanism to integrate features and embeds style features into content features of portrait photos according to the attention weights. Finally, a guided filter is introduced in content encoder to smooth the textures and specific details of source image, thereby eliminating its negative impact on style transfer. We conducted overall unified optimization training on all components and got an ADS-GAN for unpaired artistic portrait style transfer. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed method generates superior results than benchmark work in preserving the overall structure and contours of portrait; ablation and parameter study demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our framework.

DE Index Terms-Deep clustering; graph convolutional net-works (GCNs);

AB Structured clustering networks, which alleviate the oversmoothing issue by delivering hidden features from autoencoder (AE) to graph convolutional networks (GCNs), involve two shortcomings for the clustering task. For one thing, they used vanilla structure to learn clustering representations without considering feature and structure corruption; for another thing, they exhibit network degradation and vanishing gradient issues after stacking multilayer GCNs. In this article, we propose a clustering method called dual-masked deep structural clustering network (DMDSC) with adaptive bidirectional information delivery (ABID). Specifically, DMDSC enables generative self-supervised learning to mine deeper interstructure and interfeature correlations by simultaneously reconstructing corrupted structures and features. Furthermore, DMDSC develops an ABID module to establish an information transfer channel between each pairwise layer of AE and GCNs to alleviate the oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous experiments on six benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DMDSC outperforms the most advanced deep clustering algorithms.

AB Broad learning system (BLS), which emerges as a lightweight network paradigm, has recently attracted great attention for recognition problems due to its good balance between efficiency and accuracy. However, the supervision mechanism in BLS and its variants generally relies on the strict binary label matrix, which imposes limitations on approximation and fails to adequately align with the data distribution. To address this issue, in this article, two novel flexible label-induced BLS models with the manifold manner are proposed, whose notable characteristics are as follows. First, two proposed label relaxation strategies can both enlarge the margins between different categories and simultaneously enhance the diversity within labels. Second, the integration of manifold geometrical criterion enables the models to capture local feature structures, ensuring the obtained flexible labels align better with the similarity between samples. Third, the proposed models can be optimized efficiently with the alternating direction method of multipliers. Each iteration benefits from a closed-form solution, facilitating the optimization process. Extensive experiments and thorough theoretical analysis are intended to show the advantages of our proposed models compared to other state-of-the-art recognition algorithms.

AB Biological systems have a great number of visual motion detection neurons, some of which can preferentially react to specific visual regions. Nevertheless, little work has been performed about how they can be used to develop neural network models for omnidirectional collision detection. Hereby, an artificial fly visual brain neural network with presynaptic and postsynaptic subnetworks, for the first time, is developed to detect the changes of visual motion in panoramic scenes. Herein, the presynaptic subnetwork, which originates from the preferential response characteristics of five fly visual neurons, responds to all the moving objects in the panoramic field; the postsynaptic network, which is based on the properties of the angle and height detection neurons in the fly's brain system, collects the excitatory intensities of the visual neurons, and outputs the real-time activities of the main object closest to the panoramic camera. Hereafter, a computational model is constructed to implement omnidirectional collision detection, relying upon the artificial visual brain neural network and three functional neurons. The theoretical analysis has verified that the collision detection model's computational complexity depends mainly on the image input resolution. Three experimental conclusions can be clearly drawn: (i) the motion characteristics of the main object in the panoramic environment can be clearly exhibited in the neural network; (ii) the collision detection model can not only outperform the compared models but also successfully perform omnidirectional collision detection; and (iii) it spends 0.24 s or so to execute visual information processing per frame with the resolution of 120 x 80.

TI An Efficient Load Prediction-Driven Scheduling Strategy Model in
   Container Cloud
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The rise of containerization has led to the development of container cloud technology, which offers container deployment and management services. However, scheduling a large number of containers efficiently remains a significant challenge for container cloud service platforms. Traditional load prediction methods and scheduling algorithms do not fully consider interdependencies between containers or fine-grained resource scheduling, leading to poor resource utilization and scheduling efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new load prediction model CNN-BiGRU-Attention and a container scheduling strategy based on load prediction. The prediction model CNN and BiGRU focus on the local features of load data and long sequence dependencies, respectively, as well as introduce the attention mechanism to make the model more easily capture the features of long distance dependencies in the sequence. A container scheduling strategy based on load prediction is also designed, which first uses the load prediction model to predict the load state and then generates a scheduling strategy based on the load prediction value to determine the change of the number of container replicas in a fine-grained manner based on the load prediction value in the next time window, while the established domain-based container selection method is employed to facilitate the coarse-grained online migration of containers. Experiments conducted using public datasets and open-source simulation platforms demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a 37.4% improvement in container load prediction accuracy and a 21.7% improvement in container scheduling efficiency compared to traditional methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges faced by container cloud service platforms.

AB Increasing microRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to be inextricably linked to various diseases, and the discovery of their associations has become a routine way of treating diseases. To overcome the time-consuming and laborious shortcoming of traditional experiments in verifying the associations of miRNAs and diseases (MDAs), a variety of computational methods have emerged. However, these methods still have many shortcomings in terms of predictive performance and accuracy. In this study, a model based on multiple graph convolutional networks and random forest (MGCNRF) was proposed for the prediction MDAs. Specifically, MGCNRF first mapped miRNA functional similarity and sequence similarity, disease semantic similarity and target similarity, and the known MDAs into four different two-layer heterogeneous networks. Second, MGCNRF applied four heterogeneous networks into four different layered attention graph convolutional networks (GCNs), respectively, to extract MDA embeddings. Finally, MGCNRF integrated the embeddings of every MDA into the features of the miRNA-disease pair and predicted potential MDAs through the random forest (RF). Fivefold cross-validation was applied to verify the prediction performance of MGCNRF, which outperforms the other seven state-of-the-art methods by area under curve. Furthermore, the accuracy and the case studies of different diseases further demonstrate the scientific rationale of MGCNRF. In conclusion, MGCNRF can serve as a scientific tool for predicting potential MDAs.

AB The generation of a robot program can be seen as a collection of sub-problems, where many combinations of some of these sub-problems are well studied. The performance of a robot program is strongly conditioned by the location of the tasks. However, the scope of previous methods does not include workspace layout design, likely missing high-quality solutions. In industrial applications, designing robot workspace layout is part of the commissioning. We broaden the scope and show how to model a dual-arm multi-tool robot assembly problem. Our model includes more robot programming sub-problems than previous methods, as well as workspace layout design. We propose a constraint programming formulation in MiniZinc that includes elements from scheduling and routing, extended with variable task locations. We evaluate the model on realistic assembly problems and workspaces, utilizing the dual-arm YuMi robot from ABB Ltd. We also evaluate redundant constraints and various formulations for avoiding arm-to-arm collisions. The best model variant quickly finds high-quality solutions for all problem instances. This demonstrates the potential of our approach as a valuable tool for a robot programmer.

AB This paper explores the use of attributes for document image querying and retrieval. Existing document image retrieval techniques present several drawbacks: textual searches are limited to text, query-by-example searches require a sample query document on hand, and layout-based searches rigidly assign documents to one of several preset classes. Attributes have yet to be fully exploited in document image analysis. We describe document images based on attributes and utilize those descriptions to form a new querying paradigm for document image retrieval that addresses the above limitations: attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR). We create attribute-based descriptions of the documents using an expandable set of individual, independent attribute classifiers built on convolutional neural network architectures. We combine the descriptions to form queries of variable complexity which retrieve a ranked list of document images. ABDIR allows users to search for documents based on memorable visual features of their contents in a flexible way, with queries like "Find documents that have a one-column layout, are table dominant, and are colorful", or "Find historical documents that are illuminated and have see-through artifacts". Experiments on the recent PubLayNet and HisIR19 datasets demonstrate the system's ability to extract various document image attributes with high accuracy, with Darknet-53 performing best, and show very promising results for document image retrieval. ABDIR is scalable and versatile: it is easy to change, add, and remove attributes, and easy to adapt queries to new domains. It provides for document image retrieval capabilities that are not possible or are impractical with other paradigms.

AB Estimating human mobility is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic because it provides policymakers with important information for non-pharmaceutical actions. Deep learning methods perform better on tasks with enough training data than traditional estimating techniques. However, estimating human mobility during the rapidly developing pandemic is challenging because of data non-stationarity, a lack of observations, and complicated social situations. Prior studies on estimating mobility either concentrate on a single city or cannot represent the spatio-temporal relationships across cities and time periods. To address these issues, we solve the cross-city human mobility estimation problem using a deep meta-generative framework. Recently, we proposed the Spatio-Temporal Meta-Generative Adversarial Network (STORM-GAN) model, which estimates dynamic human mobility responses under social and policy conditions relevant to COVID-19 and is facilitated by a novel spatio-temporal task-based graph (STTG) embedding. Although STORM-GAN achieves a good average estimation accuracy, it creates higher errors and exhibits over-fitting in particular cities due to spatial heterogeneity. To address these issues, in this paper, we extend our prior work by introducing an improved spatio-temporal deep generative model, namely STORM-GAN+. STORM-GAN+ deals with the difficulties by including a distance-based weighted training technique into the STTG embedding component to better represent the variety of knowledge transfer across cities. Furthermore, to mitigate the issue of overfitting, we modify the meta-learning training objective to teach estimated mobility. Finally, we propose a conditional meta-learning algorithm that explicitly tailors transferable knowledge to various task clusters. We perform comprehensive evaluations, and STORM-GAN+ approximates real-world human mobility responses more accurately than previous methods, including STORM-GAN.

AB Metal materials play a significant role in modern industrial fields. However, due to their exposure to harsh environments, they are susceptible to fatigue damage, which can lead to the occurrence of metal fractures (MF). Effective and accurate identification for MF types is crucial for preventing fractures during service and developing appropriate repair and maintenance strategies. In this paper, a multi-perception region of interest feature fusion (MRIFF) method based on deep learning is proposed to achieve accurate recognition of MF types. The proposed MRIFF method incorporates three key components - the mechanism exploration (ME) module, the adaptive voting (AVT) strategy, and the average-hybrid-attention (AHA) structure, where the ME module is designed to effectively extract and transfer features in metal fracture scanning electron microscope (MFSEM) images from three base models: VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50, the AVT strategy is developed to synthesize information about MF extracted from these three base models by automatically adjust the weights of individual base model, and the AHA structure is designed to enhance the recognition ability for MF types by effectively fusing information from different scales. These components work synergistically to result in an efficient and accurate image recognition model for MF types. Experiments on the MFSEM image dataset and several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRIFF method not only achieves higher accuracy when facing the recognition tasks of MFSEM image, but also exhibits better generalization performance on other image recognition tasks.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB As an important preprocessing procedure, dimensionality reduction for multi-label learning is an effective way to solve the challenge caused by high-dimensionality data. Most existing dimensionality reduction methods are mainly used to deal with single-label and multi-label data, which assumes each related label to the instance with the same important degree. However, there are different relatively important degrees for the related labels of each instance in many real applications. In this paper, a granular ball-based label enhancement algorithm is proposed to convert the logical label into label distribution for obtaining more supervision information. The granular ball can be regarded as local coarse grain to explore sample similarity based on neighborhood viewpoints. Then, the between-granular ball scatter and within-granular ball scatter measures are presented, which are utilized to construct a label distribution feature extraction algorithm. In addition, a two-stage mutual iterative learning framework is developed, label enhancement and dimensionality reduction are mutual interactive. Finally, Experiments are conducted with the six state-of-the-art methods on eleven multi-label data in terms of multiple representative evaluation measures. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other comparison methods by an average of 36.8% over six widely-used evaluation metrics.

AB Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs), whose exponentially expanded search space and conflicting objectives have brought great challenges to traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), frequently appear in engineering applications. To make full use of the positive information carried by all the individuals, thus avoiding the lopsided distribution of the population, a large-scale tri-particle competitive swarm optimizer based on decomposition (LTCSO/D) with better distribution and convergence is proposed for solving LSMOPs properly. In the proposed optimization framework, a population splitting strategy is designed to allocate subpopulations to the decomposed search space, an innovative tri-particle competitive method is employed to enhance the diversity of the offspring, and an environmental selection mechanism based on the maximum angle priority strategy is used to balance distribution and convergence. Finally, extensive computational tests between LTCSO/D and four existing algorithms are carried out on a variety of LSMOPs with different numbers of decision variables and objectives, and the effectiveness of the specific designs in LTCSO/D is verified through the experiments. The comparative results demonstrate the significant advantages of LTCSO/D over several state-of-the-art MOEAs in solving LSMOPs.

   watermarking; Authorization verification; Security
AB With the wide application of neural network, the trained neural network model has become an important asset to provide services for users, but it also faces the risk of malicious attack or illegal tampering. Therefore, especially in safety-critical fields such as military, medical, transportation, and legal, it is crucial to provide users with an integrity authentication mechanism. In this paper, we propose a method for tamper detection and location of convolutional neural networks based on fragile watermarking, which makes it possible to recover the original model as much as possible with the help of existing intact data. Specifically, we use the HRank-based neural network pruning method and the characteristics of single precision floating-point numbers to construct the host sequence, and use the block histogram shift method to embed the watermarking information. To ensure the security of the additional information required to extract the watermarking, we encrypt it using the Combined Logistic Tent Map algorithm. At the receiving end, only the authorized owner can extract the watermarking information from the marked model, and use the characteristics of Merkle Hash Tree to achieve efficient integrity authentication and fast tamper location. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two datasets using multiple pre-trained models. The results show that the embedded fragile watermarking can not only realize the integrity authentication of the model, but also realize the authorization verification and tamper location of the model without affecting the classification performance of the model.

AB Feature matching for multimodal images is an important task in image processing. However, most methods perform image feature detection, description, and matching sequentially, resulting in a large loss, low matching accuracy, and slow performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a detector-free method called FeMIP for feature matching of multimodal images. We design coarse matching and fine regression modules to implement accurate multimodal image feature matches in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we add a novel data augmentation method enabling FeMIP to achieve feature matching faster and more accurately. The coarse-to-fine module automatically generates pixel-level labels on the original image, enabling FeMIP to perform pixel-level matching on data with only image-level labels. In addition, we use the principle of reinforcement learning to design a policy gradient method to improve the solution to the problem of discreteness in matching. Extensive experiments show that FeMIP has good generalization and achieves excellent matching performances. The code will be released at: https://github.com/LiaoYun0x0/FeMIP.

AB Ensuring safe human-robot interactions is a crucial concern in robotics research and development. However, controlling the social distance between quadruped robots and humans poses a significant challenge due to the large motion range of robots and the lack of specific social distance rules for human safety. This study proposes an innovative framework that integrates proxemic theory and ISO safety strategy to provide a new social distance control mechanism for human-quadruped robot interactions. The proposed framework uses a gated spike filter neural network (GSN) that fuses LiDAR and RGB-D data to estimate human-robot distance and ensures quantified human-robot social distance with continuous velocity limitations, which current approaches do not offer. The experimental results demonstrate that the GSN algorithm offers high accuracy and is well-suited for large-range human-robot distance control of quadruped robots. It has an average prediction error that is 31.4% lower than traditional Kalman filter methods and offers a more efficient and precise solution for real-time social distance control. Additionally, this study includes a detailed use case that demonstrates how to apply the proposed framework to human-quadruped robot interactions. Overall, this study's findings have implications for improving the safety and efficiency of human-robot interactions in various applications.

AB Zero-shot action recognition, which recognizes actions in videos without having received any training examples, is gaining wide attention considering it can save labor costs and training time. Nevertheless, the performance of zero-shot learning is still unsatisfactory, which limits its practical application. To solve this problem, this study proposes a framework to improve zero-shot action recognition using human instructions with text descriptions. The proposed framework manually describes video contents, which incurs some labor costs; in many situations, the labor costs are worth it. We manually annotate text features for each action, which can be a word, phrase, or sentence. Then by computing the matching degrees between the video and all text features, we can predict the class of the video. Furthermore, the proposed model can also be combined with other models to improve its accuracy. In addition, our model can be continuously optimized to improve the accuracy by repeating human instructions. The results with UCF101 and HMDB51 showed that our model achieved the best accuracy and improved the accuracies of other models.

This work details the development of the AI4Citizen pilot, an AI software suite designed to support the SWA programme. The AI4Citizen pilot, developed within the H2020 AI4EU project, offers AI tools to automate and enhance the current SWA process. At the same time, the AI4Citizen pilot offers novel tools to support the complex problem of allocating student teams to internship programs, promoting collaborative learning and teamwork skills acquisition. Notably, the AI4Citizen pilot corresponds to a pipeline of AI tools, integrating existing and novel technologies. Our exhaustive empirical analysis confirms that the AI4Citizen pilot can alleviate the difficulties of current processes in the SWA, and therefore it is ready for real-world deployment.

AB Analyzing highly individual-specific genomic data to understand genetic interactions in cancer development is still challenging, with significant implications for the discovery of individual biomarkers as well as personalized medicine. With the rapid development of deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed to analyze a wide range of biomolecular networks. However, many neural networks are limited to black box models, which are only capable of making predictions, and they are often challenged to provide reliable biological and clinical insights. In this research, for sample-specific networks, a novel end-to-end hierarchical graph neural network with interpretable modules is proposed, which learns structural features at multiple scales and incorporates a soft mask layer in extracting subgraphs that contribute to classification. The perturbations caused by the input graphs' deductions are used to evaluate key gene clusters, and the samples are then grouped into classes to produce both sample- and stage-level explanations. Experiments on four gene expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) show that the proposed model not only rivals the advanced GNN methods in cancer staging but also identifies key gene clusters that have a great impact on classification confidence, providing potential targets for personalized medicine.

AB This paper addresses the feature selection problem for gene expression profiles. Feature selection based on fuzzy neighborhood rough sets is very important in gene expression profiles. The process of extracting key features in gene expression profiles may have two disadvantages: (1) it may generate many redundant features, thus reducing the classification accuracy, and (2) it may ignore some information. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model based on feature selection; this model adopts the nonnegative principle of fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy to evaluate the importance of a candidate feature gene. Based on the fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model, this paper proposes a new feature gene selection algorithm: the fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy (FNJE) algorithm. In the model, first, fuzzy neighborhood particles and fuzzy decision-making are combined with the uncertainty measure of joint entropy to construct a fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model. Second, the importance degree of a feature is introduced as the measurement standard of candidate feature genes to evaluate the importance of each feature. Third, the algorithm uses the importance of candidate features in selecting features to reduce the redundancy of the selected features and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, based on the UCI and gene datasets, we conduct a series of experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can select fewer feature genes and achieve higher classification accuracy. Compared with the other four algorithms, our proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy by 0.4%-10.42% and 1.16%-15.18% and can reach maximum accuracy values of 90.52% and 87.02% with the linear-SVM and KNN classifiers, respectively.

AB Target tracking provides important location-based services in many applications. The main challenge of target tracking is to combat the severe degradation problem in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenario. Most Deep Learning algorithms available in literature to address this issue belong to batch learning with high complexity. This paper proposes a novel online sequential learning algorithm, Improved Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (IRELM), to solve the NLOS target tracking problem as a position series prediction task. IRELM is able to train Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) inputs one-by-one and adaptively update the input weight, hidden weight, feedback weight and output weight. Extensive simulations and experiments prove the superior tracking performance and feasible complexity of IRELM over the state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA) prevails in the optimization of computationally expensive problems. However, existing SAEAs confront low efficiency in the resolution of high-dimensional problems characterized by multiple local optima and multivariate coupling. To this end, this paper offers a dual-drive collaboration surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (DDCSAEA) by coupling feature reduction and reconstruction, which coordinates two unsupervised feature learning techniques, i.e., principal component analysis and autoencoder, in tandem. DDCSAEA creates a low-dimensional solution space by downscaling the target high-dimensional space via principal component analysis and collects promising candidates in the reduced space by collaborating a surrogate-assisted evolutionary sampling with differential mutation. An autoencoder is used to perform the feature reconstruction on the collected candidates for infill-sampling in the target high-dimensional space to sequentially refine the neighborhood landscapes of the optimal solution. Experimental results reveal that DDCSAEA has stronger convergence performance and optimization efficiency against eight state-of-the-art SAEAs on high-dimensional benchmark problems within 200 dimensions.

AB To achieve a green and sustainable wireless communication network, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has emerged as an emerging technology. The RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications can support enhanced V2X applications for connected and automated vehicles. The design of RIS-assisted mmWave V2X communications is though not exempt of challenges as a result of fast time-varying propagation and highly dynamic vehicular networks and topologies. To address some of these challenges, we propose an attention-deep reinforcement learning jointly beamforming based on tensor decomposition for RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO system to improving the safety and traffic efficiency of cooperative automated driving. The received signal of the vehicle is decomposed into four-dimensional tensors and study the channel, frequency and time attention (CFTA) algorithm using the low order tensor characteristics of mmWave channels. This algorithm can extract the frequency and time characteristics of the channel, and obtain the millimeter wave characteristic channel between the corresponding base station (BS) and the vehicles. The problem of jointly optimization of beamforming matrix at the BS and the phase shift matrix on the RIS is constructed and solved using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Unlike traditional alternating optimization methods, the integration of DRL techniques into the optimal design of the system enables the observation of immediate rewards, learning from the environment and improving it to obtain optimal solutions to high-dimensional jointly beamforming optimization problems ultimately. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has meaningful performance compared with other methods.

AB Alzheimer's disorder (AD) causes permanent impairment in the brain's memory of the cellular system, leading to the initiation of dementia. Earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease in the initial stages is challenging for researchers. Deep learning and machine learning-based techniques can help resolve many issues associated with brain imaging exploration. Brain MR Images (Brain-MRI) are used to detect Alzheimer's in computable research work. To correctly categorize the stages of Alzheimer's disease, discriminative features need to be extracted from the MR images. Recently, many studies have used deep learning methods for the early detection of this disorder. However, overfitting degrades the deep learning method's performance because the dataset's selection images are smaller and imbalanced. Some studies could not reach more discriminative and effectual attention-aware features for Alzheimer's stage classification to increase the model performance. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical residual attention learning-inspired multistage conjoined twin network (HRAL-CTNN) to classify the stages of Alzheimer's. We used augmentation approaches to scale insufficient and imbalanced data. The HRAL-CTNN is efficiently overcoming the issues of not obtaining efficient attention-aware and generative features for Alzheimer's stage classification. The proposed model solved the problem of redundant features by extracting attentive discriminant features, and scaling imbalance data by data augmentation, after that training and validation using HRAL-CTNN. The execution of this proposed work has been performed on the ADNI MRI dataset. This work achieved outstanding accuracy of 99.97 & PLUSMN;$$ \pm $$ 0.01% and F1 score of 99.30 & PLUSMN;$$ \pm $$ 0.02% for Alzheimer's stage classification. This model proposed by our group outperformed the existing related studies in terms of the model's performance score.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In recent years, the proliferation of tourist experience sharing on social media platforms has led to the establishment of tourism forums as a prevalent medium for expressing opinions and discussing travel experiences globally. This emerging trend has motivated researchers to explore forum reviews, considered as big data, to extract valuable insights. Accurately identifying the topics within each review presents a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data, as well as the diverse range of subjects within the tourism domain and regional variations worldwide. The ability to accurately define review topics and create clusters of related topics holds considerable potential for informing decision-making processes for both tourists and tourism operators. This study presents a novel clustering architecture that combines genetic algorithms and K-means, along with a hybrid topic discovery approach integrating latent Dirichlet allocation and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. The proposed method aims to predict and analyze the most prominent topics within the context of touristic shopping destinations in Morocco.

AB Data clustering is a method of dividing data points into similar groups. In the last few decades, there have been numerous advancements in algorithms and methodologies for the analysis of clustered data. Although some algorithms like K-means, due to their easy implementation and interpretability, are widely used for clustering, their capability of providing good solutions might be sensitive to the number of dimensions and clusters. Due to the advantages of metaheuristic-based clustering approaches like strong searchability, they have been widely used to tackle the clustering problem. Based on this premise, we propose a new bio-inspired red deer clustering algorithm (RDCA). Red deer algorithm (RDA) is a new metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of the Scottish red deer during a breeding season. First, the data space is partitioned into several divisions, each of which is represented by a disjunctive normal form expression using CLIQUE algorithm. Then a search strategy employing a modified version of RDA is pursued. Experiments are carried out to assess the performance of RDCA in comparison to eight traditional methods using six real-world and three generated datasets in terms of cluster validity measures, namely compactness, separation, combined, Turi, Davies Bouldin, and normalized mutual information score. The proposed method can handle multiple objective functions simultaneously and shows good performance when the data dimension is large. The results indicate that in most scenarios, the proposed method outperforms its counterparts. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to increasing the number of clusters and dimensions.

AB In various real-world scenarios, Fermatean fuzzy sets are commonly used to address fuzzy and uncertain challenges. The degree of similarity between Fermatean fuzzy sets is determined by computing the similarity between Fermatean fuzzy sets. The similarity metric can be used in a variety of activities, including "decision-making," "pattern recognition," "clustering analysis," and others. In this study, the three parameters of a Fermatean fuzzy set are taken into account to create a new Fermatean fuzzy similarity measure. The necessary axiomatic requirements of being a Fermatean fuzzy similarity measure are also established for the proposed similarity measure. Further, some new properties of the suggested measure are also discussed. Numerical experiments are used to test the validity of the suggested measure. To further demonstrate its effectiveness, the suggested measure is employed to resolve the bidirectional approximation reasoning and pattern recognition problems. The results of this study show that the suggested measure is a better and more precise measure that can overcome the shortcomings of most of the available measures.

AB To successfully solve complex real-world problems, decision makers with broad knowledge and experience should be involved in the decision-making process. In this paper, we address the question of how to determine weights of decision makers. The aim of our study is to propose a new approach that derives objective weights for decision makers based on projection method, which emphasizes their agreement by assigning higher weights to similar opinions. The new projection method DProj is specifically adapted for Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), which allows to determine the relationship between cause and effect factors of the system, while we show that some projection methods from the literature are not suitable for DEMATEL. To validate DProj-DEMATEL, we performed two analyses based on Manhattan and Euclidean distances on three examples from the literature. The validation results show that DProj-DEMATEL is a reliable method that can contribute to satisfactory group decision making.

AB Copula method can explain the dependent function or connection function which connects the joint distribution and the univariate marginal distribution. Therefore, copula has recently become a most significant important tool in the financial field of risk management, portfolio allocation, and derivative asset pricing. However, it leads to a possibilistic uncertainty in estimating the parameters of copulas because of insufficient historical data, imprecise parameter estimation, and uncertain knowledge of future prices. This paper proposes a fuzzy copula model via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to model the fuzzy relations, and further to investigate the hedging issues of salmon futures. We use a new framework of hedging under fuzzy circumstances, consisting of innovative marginal distributions and fuzzy intervals. By synergizing fuzzy copula and simulations, we use the fuzzy copula-GMM to obtain the hedge ratios of salmon futures. The empirical results show that, compared with traditional probabilistic methods, the fuzzy copula-GMM hedges the salmon spot risk measured by variance more successfully.

AB Extracting information from scanned invoices and other commercial documents, a critical component of corporate function, typically requires significant manual processing. Much research has been conducted in the field of automated information extraction and document processing to alleviate the manual resources used for document analysis, but resultant literature and commercially available products have demonstrated limitations in customizability for identifying specific information. In this paper, we propose a customized machine learning-based pipeline for extracting and tabulating relevant key-value pairs from commercial invoice documents. Specifically, the pipeline combines general document understanding, OCR extraction, and key-value matching with custom rules pertaining to a provided invoice dataset. Then, we demonstrate that the pipeline greatly outperforms a commercially available product and can significantly reduce the amount of manual labor required to process invoice documents. Future work will focus on generalizing the pipeline, so as to apply it on more varied datasets.

AB The response to a natural disaster ultimately depends on credible and real-time information regarding impacted people and areas. Nowadays, social media platforms such as Twitter have emerged as the primary and fastest means of disseminating information. Due to the massive, imprecise, and redundant information on Twitter, efficient automatic sentiment analysis (SA) plays a crucial role in enhancing disaster response. This paper proposes a novel methodology to efficiently perform SA of Twitter data during a natural disaster. The tweets during a natural calamity are biased toward the negative polarity, producing imbalanced data. The proposed methodology has reduced the misclassification of minority class samples through the adaptive synthetic sampling technique. A binary modified equilibrium optimizer has been used to remove irrelevant and redundant features. The k-nearest neighbor has been used for sentiment classification with the optimized value of k. The nine datasets on natural disasters have been used for evaluation. The performance of the proposed methodology has been validated using the Friedman mean rank test against nine state-of-the-art techniques, including two optimized, one transfer learning, one deep learning, two ensemble learning, and three baseline classifiers. The results show the significance of the proposed methodology through the average improvement of 6.9%, 13.3%, 20.2%, and 18% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, as compared to nine state-of-the-art techniques.

AB The representations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are formed from generalizing similarities and abstracting from differences in the manner of the empiricist theory of abstraction (Buckner, Synthese 195:5339-5372, 2018). The empiricist theory of abstraction is well understood to entail infinite regress and circularity in content constitution (Husserl, Logical Investigations. Routledge, 2001). This paper argues these entailments hold a fortiori for deep CNNs. Two theses result: deep CNNs require supplementation by Quine's "apparatus of identity and quantification" in order to (1) achieve concepts, and (2) represent objects, as opposed to "half-entities" corresponding to similarity amalgams (Quine, Quintessence, Cambridge, 2004, p. 107). Similarity amalgams are also called "approximate meaning[s]" (Marcus & Davis, Rebooting AI, Pantheon, 2019, p. 132). Although Husserl inferred the "complete abandonment of the empiricist theory of abstraction" (a fortiori deep CNNs) due to the infinite regress and circularity arguments examined in this paper, I argue that the statistical learning of deep CNNs may be incorporated into a Fodorian hybrid account that supports Quine's "sortal predicates, negation, plurals, identity, pronouns, and quantifiers" which are representationally necessary to overcome the regress/circularity in content constitution and achieve objective (as opposed to similarity-subjective) representation (Burge, Origins of Objectivity. Oxford, 2010, p. 238). I base myself initially on Yoshimi's (New Frontiers in Psychology, 2011) attempt to explain Husserlian phenomenology with neural networks but depart from him due to the arguments and consequently propose a two-system view which converges with Weiskopf's proposal ("Observational Concepts." The Conceptual Mind. MIT, 2015. 223-248).

ID LEARNING-BASED OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes binary versions of artificial rabbits optimization (ARO) for feature selection (FS) with medical diagnosis data. ARO is a recent swarm-based optimization algorithm that mimics rabbits' natural survival tactics and eating habits. It was modeled in an optimization context to tackle optimization problems of continuous search spaces. In this paper, ARO is improved to deal with the binary domain of FS. The improvements include three additions: First, different alternatives of transfer functions were used to convert ARO from continuous to binary; second, the global-best concept was added to the binary ARO to improve the exploitation capability of the proposed algorithm; and finally, Levy flight and opposition-based learning strategies were injected into the proposed algorithm to enhance its diversity and thus improve the balance between global exploration and local exploitation during all stages of the search process. Six binary variants of ARO were designed across an extensive set of experiments to study the impact of using the proposed amendments on the performance of the proposed ARO algorithm. These variants are: binary ARO with S-shaped transfer function (BAROS), binary ARO with V-shaped transfer function (BAROV), BAROS with the global-best concept (BGAROS), BGAROV with the global-best concept (BGAROV), BGAROS with Levy flight and opposition-based learning strategies (BGAROSLO), and BGAROV with Levy flight and opposition-based learning strategies (BGAROVLO). The proposed binary ARO versions were evaluated using 23 medical FS datasets. In addition, the proposed algorithm was applied to detect coronavirus disease using a real COVID-19 dataset. Five performance measures were used: classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, fitness value, and the number of selected features. In a nutshell, the proposed binary ARO versions were able to achieve success rates for these performance metrics as follows: 66.7%, 50%, 33.3%, 66.7%, and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the success of the proposed ARO versions was realized due to the suitable design of the parameters of the proposed ARO version, such as transfer functions, global-best concept, Levy flight, and opposition-based learning strategies. A comprehensive comparative evaluation was studied against ten well-established methods using the same datasets with a high preference for the proposed ARO versions, especially BGAROSLO which can achieve the best accuracy for the majority of the FS datasets. This is proven using Friedman's statistical test ad-hocked by Holm's test.

AB The CFD approach could waste a lot of time, effort, and cost for three-dimensional turbulent flow modeling. In the CFD method, any changes in the grid numbers in a specific region, the whole domain must be meshed and simulated again. More computational expenses are imposed when the mesh density must be increased. This study, for the first time, is aimed to develop a supplementary method using the artificial intelligence algorithm to reduce the post-processing calculations of the CFD approach. Eddy viscosity of alumina-water nanofluid turbulent flow inside a straight pipe is considered for prediction. The finite volume technique is used for solving the governing equations (i.e., mass, momentum, and energy) and the k-e turbulence model of the CFD approach. Algorithms for artificial intelligence have shown promise for data learning and data patterning. In this study, the FVM solutions are learned by the artificial intelligence of the bee algorithm-based fuzzy inference system (BAFIS). The finite volume technique in the CFD modeling is integrated with the BAFIS to predict eddy viscosity in the nanofluid turbulent flow. Besides, the BAFIS performance and application are examined for meshing in the post-processing step of the CFD. In this way, the BAFIS learned the CFD-driven data for the existing nodes. Then the CFD data pattern is captured by the BAFIS. Finally, this CFD pattern is extended to more nodes. For achieving the intelligence, different input numbers (2 and 3), cluster numbers (5, 10, 15, and 20), as the fuzzy C-means clustering parameter, and neighborhood damping radius rates (0.85, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.99), as bee algorithm parameter, are investigated. The intelligence of the BAFIS was achieved for 3 inputs, the cluster number of 20, and the neighborhood damping radius rate of 0.99. The predictions of the eddy viscosity of BAFIS were the same as those of CFD. The BAFIS shows the ability for the accurate prediction of the eddy viscosity (regression number of 0.98). Comparing the time consumption of the methods, for the same number of nodes (i.e., 4,473) and the same computer specifications, the prediction time of the CFD (110 min) was around half of the learning time of BAFIS (52 min). It should be noted that after the data learning, the target variable, eddy viscosity in this study, could be predicted for any number of nodes (i.e., 774,771 nodes) within a negligible time (22 s). So, no significant time was consumed by BAFIS for the mesh increment. The BAFIS results covered the CFD results for additional nodes in the new dense mesh.

AB Training Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies for a robot requires an extensive amount of data recorded while interacting with the environment. Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time-consuming task. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data may be required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this paper, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for an agent in collective motion of a homogeneous multi-agent system. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to capture the complex state transition of an agent and simulate its motion. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can accurately predict motion of all agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from the agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. Hence, the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate model with significantly less real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation for collective motion and successfully transferred to the real-world.

AB In phrase generation (PG), a sentence in the natural language is changed into a new one with a different syntactic structure but having the same semantic meaning. The present sequence-to-sequence strategy aims to recall the words and structures from the training dataset rather than learning the words' semantics. As a result, the resulting statements are frequently grammatically accurate but incorrect linguistically. The neural machine translation approach suffers to handle unusual words, domain mismatch, and unfamiliar words, but it takes context well. This work presents a novel model for creating paraphrases that use neural-based statistical machine translation (NSMT). Our approach creates potential paraphrases for any source input, calculates the level of semantic similarity between text segments of any length, and encodes paraphrases in a continuous space. To evaluate the suggested model, Quora Question Pair and Microsoft Common Objects in Context benchmark datasets are used. We demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves cutting-edge performance on both datasets using automatic and human assessments. Experimental findings across tasks and datasets demonstrate that the suggested NSMT-based PG outperforms those achieved with traditional phrase-based techniques. We also show that the proposed technique may be used automatically for the development of paraphrases for a variety of languages.

AB Computer vision has undergone significant transformation owing to deep learning in the last two decades. Deep convolutional networks have been successfully applied for various applications to learn different tasks related to vision, such as image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Deep learning models can generate fine-tuned results by transferring knowledge to large generic datasets. This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of a big data tracking algorithm for aerial images of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect houses using neural networks to address the low accuracy and efficiency of manual detection in remote areas by mitigating the associated security risks. In the context of big data, a UAV-based preprocessing method is discussed for images using guided filtering. In order to reduce the impact of radiation distortion on the color and brightness of UAV-based aerial images of houses, a histogram matching method was applied. The guided filtering method is used to solve the problem of imaging details of houses that are not apparent after smoothing and denoising the aerial images. A house detection algorithm based on a deep neural network is then applied to the UAV images to detect the images of houses, and the time consumption of the deep learning operation is examined within the context of big data. Combining deep separation convolution and calculation optimization with YOLOv2 improves the house's image detection in real-time while preserving an accurate performance of UAV-based aerial images to detect houses by combining the YOLOv2 detection framework. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of house detection using aerial images and has certain practical applications.

AB Cervical Cancer most often affects women and is a feared disease worldwide. It occurs due to the abnormal growth of cells in the cervix and slowly spreads to other organs in the body. Cervical cancer can be cured completely if detected at an early stage. Various cervical screening methods are available, but early screening with low-cost Pap smear tests is the key to curing. Knowing about this cancer, if we contribute to detecting it at an early stage, may help to save a life. For accurate disease diagnosis and prompt care at an early stage of cell development, automated Pap smear cell recognition and classification are critical. Various computer-aided systems are available that use hand-crafted features of Pap smear images to categorize them into normal and abnormal cells. Deep learning classification methods have been the top choice as their approaches have attained state-of-the-art in tumor identification. In this article, deep learning is used in two different ways. In this approach, pre-trained models as feature extractors and different machine learning algorithms are utilized for classification; the second approach used is transfer learning using pre-trained models to classify Cervical Cancer images. Using the first method with a pre-trained model as a feature extractor, ResNet-50 achieves the highest classification accuracy of 92.03%. Using the second approach of fine-tuning pre-trained models, Google Net has given the highest classification accuracy of 96.01%.

AB The user's behavior towards smartphone is not static and changes dynamically as the real world changes, depending on various contextual patterns. Finding the latest behavioral rules is challenging because the smartphone log is incremented with the user's behavior, which is not static and changes daily. Previously, for mining, the latest user behavioral rules researchers have used the recent log of static periods and considered it as the latest behavioral log; however those approaches create accuracy and reliability problems because with time behavioral log keeps on updating and some user behaviors become outdated. On the basis of user's volatile behaviors toward smartphones, this study devises the issue of modeling an individual's up-to-date behavioral rules with their smart-phone interaction co-occurring patterns by incorporating the dynamically changing log data. Proposed behavioral-based approach named "PredictionMiner" firstly, mines the dynamic log period which holds the latest behavior of individual users by neglecting the outdated behaviors. Secondly, it extracts the individual latest smartphone machine learning rules with co-occurring contextual patterns. By utilizing individualized co-occurring patterns with the corresponding behavioral rules, the personalized context aware prediction model is built for predicting future smartphone contextual behavioral activities. The proposed approach dynamically mines the latest machine learning rules and removes the outdated rules making it more effective. To make this approach more relevant, real-world contextual notifications dataset has been used. Our experiments and comparisons on each contextual dataset show that proposed rule discovery approach is more adequate and accurate than base models.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is frequently employed to improve human lives by monitoring various physical and mental activities. IoT may significantly improve the performance and advancement of athletes by collecting, analyzing, and tracking consumer data. Training and teaching are widely used in sports to exploit the benefits of various technologies such as image processing, computer vision, big data, and advanced artificial intelligence. In sports, the traditional technical movement analysis using video and high-speed photography is used to standardize action, which is essential for improving performance of the athletes. This paper uses IoT technology to build a feature model for technical actions in sports so that the manifestation of information can be more diversified and then collate, store, transmit, and process the multimedia data. It uses image processing technology to quantitatively analyze sports technical action to build an action model. It combines the forward kinematics of the human body based on the root bone using deep learning-enabled human bone recognition algorithm. Next, it uses the obtained information to construct the structural model of human body, and athletes' sports data are fed into it to complete the quantitative processing of action characteristics and pattern analysis. Finally, the application impact of the analysis model for striking force by the legs on sports athletes reveals that the maximum strike force of athletes is 486 N after reaching the target for 13 s, and then, it starts to fall. In sports training, the accuracy of each leg joint varies according to athletes' speed, wherein the contribution of the hip was 20.5%, the knee was 20.5%, and the ankle was 71.1%, respectively. As a result, the method presented in this study for forward kinematics of the human body provides a robust and fast technique for determining the position and attitude of rigid body chains. This approach eliminates repetitive computations and increases computing performance by focusing on the trunk bone first, recursive calculations, and transformation matrices. These developments lead to this paper's higher performance when compared to earlier research by making it a noteworthy addition to human body kinematics.

AB In recent years, the sports industry has experienced a significant transformation by integrating artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Among other sports, table tennis has seen a digital revolution. Analyzing the rotational trajectory of table tennis balls enhances strategic decision-making and players' performance. Using deep learning methods to analyze rotation trajectory in table tennis improves training efficiency and competitive athletic performance while reducing cost. Traditional approaches to trajectory analysis could be more time-consuming and effective in analyzing table tennis rotation trajectories more precisely and efficiently. The proposed method combines two deep learning algorithms, Spatial Upsampling and Reconstruction Encoder (SURE) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to achieve accurate and dependable trajectory analysis. The SURF algorithm is used for environment motion by separating the table tennis rotation trajectory image into foreground and background points. Using color, displacement, and position data from the corrected image, frame difference processing, and morphological techniques integrate table tennis moving objects that revolve using morphological techniques and frame difference processing. The LSTM trajectory prediction network predicts the rotation of table tennis balls. The spin type of the table tennis ball is inferred from its flight trajectory. Table tennis ball speeds and rotation trajectories may be analyzed using the first five seconds of motion, simply splitting the rotation into three coordinate directions. The experimental results showed the rotation trajectory of a table tennis ball to achieve an accuracy of 96.5% and a prediction speed of 15 s, which is exceptional compared to previous models. Compared to the proposed scheme with conventional methods, the Feature Fusion Network (FFN), DCNN-LSTM, and RNN algorithms achieve better performance from them. Accurate and efficient motion trajectory prediction improves table tennis practice and competition by identifying complex temporal correlations in ball rotations.

AB In this study, we presented a novel hybrid artificial intelligence method for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Kalaleh Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. This method uses rotation forests (RF) as a Meta classifier based on Java decision trees (J48), as a base classifier named RF-J48. The created model was compared to some benchmark models, such as the J48, the open-source naive Bayes tree, and the reduced error pruning tree (REPTree). Locations of 260 different landslides were found and mapped. Additionally, it was split into training data (70%) and testing data (30%) for spatial modeling and validation analysis. Twelve landslide effective factors were chosen for the landslide susceptibility mapping process based on a literature review and the results of the multicollinearity evaluation (LSM). The approximate percentage of high LS over the Kalaleh Watershed catchment for four models is RF-J48 = 19.92%, J48 = 15.87%, NBTree = 20.13% and REPTree = 16.76%, respectively. The LS model is evaluated through the methods of TSS, efficiency, and kappa index methods on the training and validation datasets, shown in Fig. 8. Efficiency values computed using validation data/training data for each model is NBTree = 0.855/0.908, J48 = 0.868/0.911, REPTree = 0.862/0.877, and RF-J48 = 0.875/0.992, respectively. The Kappa index for each model has shown significant accuracy. The index values are maximum for the ensemble model RF-J48 of 0.537 and 0.88 for validation and training data.

AB The image quality is degraded during transmission and reception of images due to the impulse noise. Existing median filters are not compatible and may not give satisfactory results at high impulse noise densities for real-time image impulse de-noising applications. The proposed modular neural network using an Intelligent Impulse De-noising and Impulse Classifier-based hybrid median filter controls the various impulse noise densities by replacing the impulse pixel with a processed central pixel in the filtering window of the image. For removing high levels of noise, the proposed architecture is processed, and the left adjacent pixel is considered an approximation of the median output using min-max-average pooling. This paper presents four novel techniques in the newly proposed deep learning architecture to reduce the computation complexity. Firstly, to address the problem of the number of comparators and the technique proposed for reducing the comparators, Second, the impulse classifier is based on a neural network-based MIN-MAX-average pooling scheme for high level noise density. Then, the entire architecture is designed with both parallel and pipeline structures to improve the throughput. Finally, approximate adders eliminate the speed versus accuracy trade-off by simplifying the average operation of the optimized adder used by the mean filter. According to the implementation findings based on the targeted programmable VLSI-based device named ZYNQ FPGA, the proposed architecture could enable a hybrid median filter at a throughput of 3.75 ns and a power consumption of 478 mW.

ID ENSEMBLES; MODEL
AB Estimation of compressive strength (CS) of concrete is an active area of research in the domain of manufacturing engineering. The concrete ingredients are disseminated arbitrarily over the whole concrete matrix and the relationships among them are a complex nonlinear system, thus challenging to model. Soft computing techniques are found better to statistical methods applied for prediction of CS. However, sophisticated prediction models are still missing and need to be explored. Random vector functional link network (RVFLN) is an efficient algorithm with low time complexity and is able to handle complex domain problems without compromising on accuracy. It assigns input-hidden layer weights and bias randomly without further modification and computes output layer weights iteratively by gradient methods or non-iteratively by least square methods. Though it is applied on solving various engineering problems, its application on CS prediction of concrete is scarce. The learning ability, structural simplicity, and computational efficiency of RVFLN motivated us to investigate its efficiency on compressive strength prediction. In this article, we develop a RVFLN-based forecast for estimation of CS concrete. A publicly available dataset from UCI repository is used to develop and access the performance of the model. For comparative analysis, few other models such as FLANN, MLP, RBFNN, MLR, and ARIMA are also developed and used for the forecasting considering samples with curing ages at 14, 28, 56, and 91 days. All the models are evaluated in terms of MAPE, ARV, U of Theil's statistics (UT), NMSE, and execution time. Considering the four-sample series, RVFLN attained an average MAPE of 0.5341, ARV of 0.0982, UT of 0.3239, and NMSE of 0.1188 which are smaller than other models. The study revealed that RVFLN is quite capable in modeling and predicting the CS data. Outcomes of comparative studies and statistical significance tests are in favor of RVFLN-based forecasting.

AB The information era has raised expectations for cinema and television production in recent years. As a result, movie and television production has changed from silent to sound, black-and-white to color, along with more varieties and contents. Therefore, movies, television, and photography use camera motion tracking for effective performance. Based on the benefits and scope of the motion tracking technology, this study uses the aforementioned technology for cinema, television, and photography based on Big data. First, the video-based human motion tracking technology is described in detail, and video motion detection algorithms are introduced. Next, Big data technology is explained and integrated with motion tracking technology in movies and television production along with photography. The method selects the Hadoop open-source cloud platform as the underlying platform and combines the MapReduce distributed programming model and Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Next, it explains the types of real-time tracking technology, lists the operation process of motion tracking by applying it in movies and television production. The particle filter algorithm is employed for human motion tracking in movies, television production and photography technology. This algorithm tracks the initial posture of human body in the video, gathers tracking data, and analyzes human motion information and actions within the recorded footage. Finally, the results of motion tracking algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization-Particle Filter (PSO-PF), Particle Filter (PF), Kalman Filter (KF), Mean-Shift (MS) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that the motion time of a single for the selected algorithm was 84 ms and the tracking success rate was 96.5%, respectively, which indicates that the motion tracking success rate of the selected algorithm is higher. Through further testing of PSO-PF algorithm, the results show that it can process 26.67 Frame Per Second (fps), which is much faster and meets the requirements of movie, television production and photography technology.

AB Badminton is a popular sport that requires precision, accuracy and speed. The latest technological trends ensure that it has far reaching effects on sports including badminton. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of training assistant for badminton training to increase the training efficiency and effectiveness of the players. The concept of virtual reality is used to build the system architecture for badminton. Moreover, 3D-enabled MAX tools are used to construct and design the simulation for training fields by utilizing the data present in the system database. To estimate the system status, Kalman filter is used for observation and mathematical model's predictions. The Kalman filter also helps in calculating the arm movement and posture angle of badminton players. To address uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning, the Bayesian algorithm is used that relies on Bayes' theorem. The Bayesian algorithm develops a posture estimation method for badminton players to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Experimental validation shows that the AI-based badminton training ensures that the system is more stable which enhances the efficiency of the prayers during competitions. The proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches, i.e., Serve, BackRub, Pouncing, and Counterattack. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms or at least matched the existing algorithms in categorizing actions as Push Forward, Push Backward, Picking, Reverse Pick, and Lofty.

AB The early detection and treatment of tumors play a crucial role in reducing their high risk and mortality rates. Tumor markers with high sensitivity and specificity have emerged as valuable indicators for tumor diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Among the detection methods, chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) has gained significant attention due to its advantages of high sensitivity, wide detection range, simplicity, repeatability, specificity, automation, and absence of radioactive reagents. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines CLIA for tumor marker detection with artificial neural network (ANN) analysis for cancer classification and screening. The research includes an overview of CLIA's status, introduction of the SAE neural network model, selection of evaluation indices, and construction of the optimal SAE model. In this paper, CLIA is employed to detect the relationship between tumor markers and tumors. An overview of CLIA's research status is presented, providing a theoretical foundation for the proposed analysis method. The technical principles of ANN are introduced, and the SAE neural network model is proposed. Model evaluation indices are selected, and through experiments, the optimal SAE model is constructed by determining the SAE parameters. Sample data are inputted, and the model's accuracy, recall, and F1 score are obtained. A comparison with other models reveals that the SAE model proposed in this paper exhibits the best detection performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed SAE model outperforms other models, exhibiting superior detection performance.

AB As robots are expected to get more involved in people's everyday lives, frameworks that enable intuitive user interfaces are in demand. Hand gesture recognition systems provide a natural way of communication and, thus, are an integral part of seamless human-robot interaction (HRI). Recent years have witnessed an immense evolution of computational models powered by deep learning. However, state-of-the-art models fall short of expanding across different gesture domains, such as emblems and co-speech. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid hand gesture recognition system. Our Snapture architecture enables learning both static and dynamic gestures: by capturing a so-called snapshot of the gesture performance at its peak, we integrate the hand pose and the dynamic movement. Moreover, we present a method for analyzing the motion profile of a gesture to uncover its dynamic characteristics, which allows regulating a static channel based on the amount of motion. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach on two gesture benchmarks compared to a state-of-the-art CNNLSTM baseline. Our analysis on a gesture class basis unveils the potential of our Snapture architecture for performance improvements using RGB data. Thanks to its modular implementation, our framework allows the integration of other multimodal data, like facial expressions and head tracking, which are essential cues in HRI scenarios, into one architecture. Thus, our work contributes both to integrative gesture recognition research and machine learning applications for non-verbal communication with robots.

DE Meta-learning; Machine learning; AutoML; Metadata; Recommender systems
AB The adoption of machine learning (ML) in organizations is characterized by the use of multiple ML software components. When building ML systems out of these software components, citizen data scientists face practical requirements which go beyond the known challenges of ML, e. g., data engineering or parameter optimization. They are expected to quickly identify ML system options that strike a suitable trade-off across multiple performance criteria. These options also need to be understandable for non-technical users. Addressing these practical requirements represents a problem for citizen data scientists with limited ML experience. This calls for a concept to help them identify suitable ML software combinations. Related work, e. g., AutoML systems, are not responsive enough or cannot balance different performance criteria. This paper explains how AssistML, a novel concept to recommend ML solutions, i. e., software systems with ML models, can be used as an alternative for predictive use cases. Our concept collects and preprocesses metadata of existing ML solutions to quickly identify the ML solutions that can be reused in a new use case. We implement AssistML and evaluate it with two exemplary use cases. Results show that AssistML can recommend ML solutions in line with users' performance preferences in seconds. Compared to AutoML, AssistML offers citizen data scientists simpler, intuitively explained ML solutions in considerably less time. Moreover, these solutions perform similarly or even better than AutoML models.

   emergence; the enactive approach; sense-making in the wild

AB The enactive approach characterizes life and cognition as sense-making. The standard description of sense-making entails the co-emergence of an agent's self and a meaningful world, as well as the emergence of a normativity that guides the behaviour of the coupled agent-environment system. This emergent process happens at different levels of interactions: biological, sensorimotor, intercorporeal and linguistic. Sense-making therefore accounts for the natural origins of intentionality and meaning and gives continuity to the emergent enactive processes of life and mind. The standard description of sense-making is nonetheless too abstract and neglects many historical and ecological aspects relevant to the scientific study of life and mind processes as they happen in concrete fields of action. To address this issue, I propose the enlarged description of sense-making in the wild, which is based on three fundamental concepts: norm development, enactive-situated normativity and transverse emergence. Norm development defines sense-making as a historically situated process that transforms the previously given dynamical configuration of the agent-environment system into a new one. Enactive-situated normativity asserts that in addition to the agent's self-maintenance and the material constraints of the agent-environment system, many dynamical constraints, ecologically situated, shape the origin, maintenance and development of sense-making processes. Finally, transverse emergence describes the transformational process of the whole agent-environment system dynamically, as a reconfiguration of the landscape of attractors that exhibit the typical behaviour of the system. Sense-making in the wild thus aims to facilitate conceptual tools to study enactive cognition, as it happens in concrete fields of action.

AB The static photovoltaic (PV) models simulate the current and voltage to convert solar energy to electricity. Besides, it is an optimization problem that identifies the unknown parameters of PV models. Runge Kutta optimizer (RUN) was proposed in 2021 when the source code was public. Thus, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning strategy adapted Local Gradient Nelder-Mead Runge Kutta method (RLGNMRUN) for building a novel parameter identification model. In this case, the modified local escaping operator of the gradient-based optimizer replaces the enhanced solution quality strategy of RUN, which increase convergence speed and avoid the local optima. Nelder-Mead simplex (NMs) mechanism forms simplex mining higher quality solutions. Through the reinforcement learning Q-learning reasonably switches between the above two mechanisms, and the proposed method achieves a balanced competitive advantage between global exploration and local exploitation. Experimental results conclude that the modified method has more advantages than existing algorithms under multiple optimization functions, different PV component models, and different environmental conditions in identifying unknown parameters of the PV model.

AB This paper investigates the stability of complex-valued (CV) fractional-order neural networks with uncertain parameters and neutral-type delay. Firstly, two improved reciprocally convex inequalities (RCIs) and three less-conservative integral inequalities are generalized to the complex-valued domain. Secondly, the existence, uniqueness and delay-independent robust stability conditions of the addressed networks are proposed based on the CV homeomorphism theorem. Thirdly, by constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, delay-dependent robust stability conditions of the considered networks are derived by utilizing the improved complex-valued RCIs and integral inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness and practicality of the presented method.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Metaheuristic algorithms are novel optimization algorithms often inspired by nature. In recent years, scholars have proposed various metaheuristic algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization (PSO), crow search algorithm, and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), to solve optimization problems. Among these, PSO is the most commonly used. However, different algorithms have different limitations. For example, PSO is prone to premature convergence and falls into a local optimum, whereas GA coding is difficult and uncertain. Therefore, an algorithm that can increase the computing power and particle diversity can address the limitations of existing algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm, called whale particle optimization (WPO), that combines the advantages of the WOA and PSO to increase particle diversity and can jump out of the local optimum. The performance of the WPO algorithm was evaluated using four optimization problems: function evaluation, image clustering, permutation flow shop scheduling, and data clustering. The test data were selected from real-life situations. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm competes well against existing algorithms.

AB Due to hardware limitations, existing hyperspectral (HS) camera often suffer from low spatial/temporal resolution. Recently, it has been prevalent to super-resolve a low resolution (LR) HS image into a high resolution (HR) HS image with a HR RGB (or multispectral) image guidance. Previous approaches for this guided super-resolution task often model the intrinsic characteristic of the desired HR HS image using hand-crafted priors. Recently, researchers pay more attention to deep learning methods with direct supervised or unsupervised learning, which exploit deep prior only from training dataset or testing data. In this article, an efficient convolutional neural network-based method is presented to progressively super-resolve HS image with RGB image guidance. Specifically, a progressive HS image super-resolution network is proposed, which progressively super-resolve the LR HS image with pixel shuffled HR RGB image guidance. Then, the super-resolution network is progressively trained with supervised pre-training and unsupervised adaption, where supervised pre-training learns the general prior on training data and unsupervised adaptation generalises the general prior to specific prior for variant testing scenes. The proposed method can effectively exploit prior from training dataset and testing HS and RGB images with spectral-spatial constraint. It has a good generalisation capability, especially for blind HS image super-resolution. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed deep progressive learning method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for HS image super-resolution in non-blind and blind cases.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Autonomous driving is the future of the automotive industry across the globe. Many challenges must be resolved in designing and developing successful Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), especially in developing countries with poor road infrastructure. Detecting obstacles in lanes is essential for robust ADS to decide whether to change lanes, slow down, or even stop. Developing countries like India present challenges, including poor or no lane line demarcation, poor traffic management, and diverse driving behaviors. That brings many challenges to developing robust lane-keeping or lane-changing decision systems in an ADS. Publicly available driving datasets have an inherent bias towards the road infrastructure of developed countries and hence cannot cater to the needs of the Indian requirements. That makes the existing obstacle-lane segment detection models unsuitable for road infrastructures in developing countries. Due to these factors, the rate of advancement of ADS and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in developing countries is meager compared to other developed countries. This makes it even more critical for future research to focus on these developing countries. This paper proposes a deep-learning-based novel decision-making network named LaneScanNET to assist the ADS in lane-changing or lane-keeping decision-making. The proposed system assists ADS in detecting obstacles, localization of the Ego Vehicle (EGV) on roads, and estimating lane status in its Field of View (FOV). The proposed LaneScanNET uses a parallel pipeline with an Obstacle Detection Network (ODN) and a Lane Detection Network (LDN) to simultaneously process the incoming image frames for detecting obstacles and segmenting lane lines, respectively. Further, the Obstacle-Lane Fusion Network (OLFN) fuses these results to predict the status of the obstacle lane in the FOV of autonomous vehicles. Vellore Institute of Technology's (VIT's) real-time driving dataset on indigenous roads has been collected to train the proposed LaneScanNET with 2464 obstacle-lane images obtained by driving over 60 km. The dataset generated for obstacle detection and its corresponding lane detection has also been made publicly available to promote research work for these developing countries. The proposed system outperforms all existing networks on Indian roads with an accuracy of 75.28% in obstacle detection and 91.36% in lane detection. Additionally, the proposed system can analyze the lane status with an accuracy of 92.54%. The proposed network performs exceptionally well in unforeseen circumstances like shadows, fog, dust, and occlusions making LaneScanNET a robust network that can be an add-on for ADS to make lane-keeping or lanechanging decisions. The LaneScanNET can be integrated into real-time vehicles to assist drivers or ADS.

ID ANIMAL BIOMETRICS; CATTLE IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION
AB Cattle identification is pivotal for many reasons. Animal health management, traceability, bread classification, and verification of insurance claims are largely depended on the accurate identification of the animals. Conventionally, animals have been identified by various means such as ear tags, tattoos, rumen implants, and hot brands. Being non-scientific approaches, these controls can be easily circumvented. The emerging technologies of biometric identification are extensively applied for Human recognition via thumb impression, face features, or eye retina patterns. The application of biometric recognition technology has now moved towards animals. Cattle identification with the help of muzzle patterns has shown tremendous results. For precise identification, nature has awarded a unique Muzzle pattern that can be utilized as a primary biometric feature. Muzzle pattern image scanning for biometric identification has now been extensively applied for identification. Animal recognition via Muzzle pattern image for different applications has been proliferating gradually. One of those applications includes the identification of fake insurance claims under livestock insurance. Fraudulent animal owners tend to lodge fake claims against livestock insurance with proxy animals. In this paper, we proposed the solution to avoid and/or discard fraudulent claims of livestock insurance by intelligently identifying the proxy animals. Data collection of animal muzzle patterns remained challenging. Key aspects of the proposed system include: (1) the Animal face will be detected through visual using YOLO v7 object detector. (2) After face detection, the same procedures will apply to detect muzzle point (3) the muzzle pattern is extracted and then stored in the database. The System has a mean average precision of 100% for the face and 99.43% for the nose/muzzle point of the animal. Once the animal is registered in the database, the identification process is initiated by extracting unique nose pattern features with ORB and/or SIFT. Then it is matched using the pattern matchers like BFMatcher and/ or FLANNMatcher for animal identification. The proposed model is more efficient and accurate as compared to concurrent approaches. The results extracted from this research study show 100% accurate identification.

AB Possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering (PFCM) is an unsupervised hybrid clustering algorithm, which can partly inherit the stability of fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm and the noise robustness of possibilistic c-means clustering (PCM) algorithm. However, there are still several limitations in the PFCM when clustering complex data with multiple characteristics: sensitivity to strong noise, coincident clustering problem in multi-class clustering, and disability to deal with strong correlations of feature components. Therefore, a double-suppressed possibilistic fuzzy Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm (DS-PFGK) is presented. Firstly, we design a new objective function with a modified Mahalanobis distance and an improved weight parameter setting method based on the stability of fuzzy memberships and the anti-noise ability of possibilistic memberships. Moreover, combined with the absolute attribute of possibilistic memberships and the covariance matrix in the modified Mahalanobis distance, an ellipsoidal cluster core which can depict the distribution of sample data is generated to divide each cluster into different regions for selecting appropriate learning objects and identifying noisy data adaptively. Then, a "double-suppressed competitive learning"strategy is designed for the selected learning objects to solve the coincident clustering problem in multi-class clustering by suppressing the nonwinner possibilistic memberships, and to reduce the iteration number by suppressing nonwinner fuzzy memberships and rewarding winner fuzzy memberships. Finally, a segmentation algorithm on noisy color images based on the DS-PFGK is proposed based on the generated cluster cores. Experiments on synthetic datasets, real datasets, and color images show the good performance of the proposed methods compared with several classical and state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Model construction, which determines the employed surrogate and its hyperparameters, is a major component of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). Many existing SAEAs use a (partially) fixed setting for the surrogate type and its hyperparameters, possibly due to a shortage of solid evidence that clarifies whether the gain from online tuning outweighs its cost and effort. This study performs a systematic cost-benefit analysis to determine the most suitable approach to tune three popular surrogate types: radial basis functions (RBFs), Gaussian processes (GPs), and support vector regression (SVR). For each, a multilevel tuning scheme is designed where a higher tuning level optimizes more hyperparameters, presumably resulting in a more accurate model if the allocated time for tuning is sufficient. Our numerical results reveal that this is true only up to a specific point. After that, a higher tuning level deteriorates or at least does not improve the quality of the tuned model. The recommended tuning level for each surrogate type is then determined following an investigation of the tradeoff between the tuning cost and gain. The effect of problem dimensionality and data size on the gain from online tuning and the potential merits of using an ensemble of surrogates are explored. Our comprehensive simulations disclose the best tuning strategies for these three surrogates and their ensemble; nevertheless, the methodology can be applied to other surrogates. The findings in this study are expected to reinforce future SAEAs with superior model construction strategies, ultimately improving their efficiency.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Detecting series arcing faults in the electrical networks of aircraft can help mitigate dramatic consequences such as fires. Non-Artificial Intelligence algorithms often fail to generalise due to arc fault signals diversity. Most methods in the detection literature use multiple pre-processing (descriptors) associated to a machine learning model (or deep learning). These approaches require to handcraft the descriptors. We propose a deep learning approach without descriptors. We adapted a sequence-based model called a Transformer Neural Network (TNN) model to this time series problem. We repurposed the encoder of the transformer as a sequence-to-sequence model. The model takes as an input a window of electric current, with at least one period of the signals (800 Hz). The output is the label of each point in the input window. This required to propose an original manner of labelling the signals, for which we designed an automated algorithm, increasing the training supervision. Contrary to existing models on aircraft signals, our TNN model has been verified using a public experimental database of electrical-arc signals that simulates aircraft signals (230 V AC at 400 - 800 Hz, arcs in series with resistive loads). Our model obtained an identification accuracy of 96.3% at a 2% false positive rate. One of the significant performance of our model is that it has the lowest parameter number (2266) that can be found in scientific literature by quite some margin. TNNs are therefore an appropriate candidate for the purpose of arc fault detection, and our labelling method provides a very high temporal resolution of the output.

AB Email is one of the most widely used ways to communicate, with millions of people and businesses relying on it to communicate and share knowledge and information on a daily basis. Nevertheless, the rise in email users has occurred a dramatic increase in spam emails in recent years. Considering the escalating number of spam emails, it has become crucial to devise effective strategies for spam detection. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a novel technique for email spam detection that is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms. During system training, the network is selectively focused on necessary parts of the email text. The usage of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, abstract, and generalizable features by hierarchical representation is the major contribution of this study. Additionally, this contribution incorporates cross-dataset evaluation, which enables the generation of more independent performance results from the model's training dataset. According to cross-dataset evaluation results, the proposed technique advances the results of the present attention-based techniques by utilizing temporal convolutions, which give us more flexible receptive field sizes are utilized. The suggested technique's findings are compared to those of state-of-the-art models and show that our approach outperforms them.

AB Finding the degree of similarity measurement is one of the challenges of mixed data clustering. In this article, it has been tried to design a more efficient method by innovating in three important parts of clustering. In the part of the general method, for assigning data objects to the cluster, in addition to the distance, attention is paid to the "number of similar features". Compared to assigning each object to a cluster, in cases where the distances are equal or close, the cluster center with the highest number of fea-tures similar to the given objects will be appropriate. This method is more accurate than the Hamming distance. To determine the cluster centers, instead of random selection, a more suitable object is identi-fied with a distance-based method. In accuracy in three datasets, the proposed algorithm has performed at least two percent better than the other algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DISCOVERY
AB Interactions of multiple processes and different objects can be captured using object-centric event data. Object-centric event data represent process executions as event graphs of interacting objects. When applying machine learning techniques to object-centric event data, the event log has to be flattened into sequential process executions used as input for traditional process mining approaches. However, sequentializing the events by flattening removes the graph structure of object-centric event data and, therefore, constitutes an information loss. In this paper, we present a general approach to preserve the graph structures of object-centric event data across machine learning tasks in process mining. We provide two different techniques to preserve these structures depending on the required input format of machine learning techniques: as direct graph encodings or as graph embeddings. We evaluate our contributions by applying three different predictive process monitoring tasks to direct graph encodings, graph embeddings, and flattened event logs. Based on the relative performances, we assess the information contained in the graph structure of object-centric event logs that is, currently, lost in machine learning approaches for traditional process mining. Furthermore, we compare different graph embedding techniques for object-centric event logs to derive recommendations for future research and deployment. To conclude, we assess the improvement that graph embeddings constitute over state-of-the-art approaches that capture object information through specific features. Our contributions improve predictive process monitoring on object-centric event data and quantify the potential performance increases of predictive models. These contributions are especially relevant when looking at real-life applications of predictive process monitoring which are often applied to information systems with relational databases that contain multiple objects and, currently, still enforce flattening.

   Metric fusion
AB Person re-identification identifies pedestrians by analyzing image information from surveillance videos. However, it faces challenges like occlusion, changing lighting, and costly annotation. Thus, it is often performed in a few-shot environment with limited images. In response to the problem of insufficient available pedestrian images in person re-identification, a few-shot person re-identification method based on feature set augmentation and metric fusion is proposed. In this work, firstly, a feature augmentation method is introduced into the feature embedding module. This method introduces multi-head self-attention in different feature extraction layers and spatial attention in feature fusion of different feature extraction layers, which can extract more diverse and discriminative pedestrian features. Secondly, a dual metric method combining Euclidean and cosine distance is proposed in the metric module to comprehensively measure the absolute spatial distance and directional difference of pedestrian features. In this way, the reliability of pedestrian similarity measurement is improved. Then, pedestrian feature similarity scores are obtained separately using the dual metric and relation metric methods. Finally, the combined metric score is obtained by weighted fusion, and the combined metric score is used to construct the joint loss to realize the overall optimization and training of the network. Experimental results on three small datasets, Market-mini, Duke-mini, and MSMT17-mini, show that the proposed method significantly improves recognition performance compared to other few-shot learning algorithms. Specifically, in scenarios 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot, the average recognition accuracies are 92.54% and 96.99%, 87.93% and 96.08%, and 71.68% and 84.51%, respectively.

ID NETWORK
AB Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is always a research hotspot in ubiquitous computing scenario, in which feature learning has played a crucial role. Recent years have witnessed outstanding success of contrastive learning in image data, which learns invariant representations by adding contrastive loss to the last layer of deep neural networks. However, the advantages of contrastive loss have been rarely leveraged in time series data for activity recognition. A fundamental obstacle to contrastive learning in HAR is that image-based augmentation could not fit well with sensor data, which raises a critical issue: the distortions induced by augmentation might be further enlarged by intermediate layers of a network and thus severely harm semantic structure of original activity instance. In this paper, taking an inspiration from deeply-supervised learning, we propose a novel approach called Contrastive Supervision by considering "where"to contrast, which aims to learn time series augmentation invariances by forcing positive pairs nearby and negative pairs far apart at different depths of neural network. Our approach can be seen as a generalization of contrastive learning in a deeply-supervised setting, where the contrastive loss is used to supervise the intermediate layers instead of only the last layer, allowing us to effectively leverage label information so as to better fuse the multi-level features. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can learn better representations and improve classification accuracy without additional inference cost for various HAR tasks in supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the growing field of mechanobiology, artificial mechano-reactive systems play an essential role in the generation of mechanical forces and control of material deformations. Free-standing magnetic nanoparticles have been studied for the mechanical stimulation of living cells. Magnetic composite materials are also used to mimic muscles at macroscale. In this study, a new magnetically actuated membrane is focused, which can be used for various applications in soft robotics or as a bioreactor. It consists of a few microns thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane in which an array of magnetic microdisks is embedded. These membranes have a large tuneable flexibility, and they are transparent, biocompatible, and waterproof. They are usable in biology and optics, both potentially combined. The membrane deformations under magnetic field have been experimentally characterized and modeled. By growing pancreatic cells on such membranes, it has been demonstrated that insulin production from the cells can be enhanced thanks to the mechanical stimulation of the cells provided by the actuated membrane.

AB Compact, low-inertia, and soft compliant robotic joint mechanisms are in great demand for ensuring safe interactions in human-robot collaborative tasks. Tensegrity, of which the structural integrity is constrained by tension, does not involve static/sliding friction among the rigid components. However, this mechanical stability is very susceptible to actuation errors. It requires complex kinematics modeling and sophisticated control model with sensing feedback. Herein, a low-inertia tensegrity joint that is covered/protected by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-embedded silicone sheath is proposed, with the aim to reinforce the joint motion stability and enable self-contained sensing feedback. A learning-based closed-loop controller is also designed and trained with the proper joint configurations selected by a two-step sampling method. Both the kinematics and static equilibriums of such configurations can be well satisfied. The experiments demonstrate that the joint can follow paths accurately in 2D by compensating manipulation error shortly under the closed-loop control. The joint stiffness can also be varied against the external/impulsive disturbances. It can be foreseen that this primitive robot joint component with 2 degrees of freedom (DoFs) can provide safe, compliant interaction with human, for which a simple test of maneuvering a portable ultrasound probe (& AP;210 g) for abdominal imaging is demonstrated.

AB The purchase-to-pay (P2P) process is one of the core business processes in any organization. It ensures the correct and efficient provisioning of materials and services. An efficient P2P process reduces operational costs by ensuring discounts, avoiding late payments, and choosing the optimal supplier for the goods. Process mining techniques help practitioners optimize the execution of P2P processes by analyzing the execution data and providing useful insights. However, existing techniques may result in misleading insights due to many-to-many relationships between business objects, e.g., between orders and invoices in the P2P process. Recently, object-centric process mining techniques have been proposed to avoid the limitations of traditional process mining techniques. In this paper, we present a case study on a real-life P2P process using object-centric process mining techniques. To that end, we adopt the well-known PM2 process mining project methodology to the object-centric setting and analyze the performance and compliance.

AB Throughout recent years, several researchers have proposed computational tools and algorithms to support team formation in the classroom. The result is that team formation algorithms have been widely applied in classroom environments to create well-balanced teams. One of the challenges in designing algorithms for automatic team formation is designing an appropriate function to estimate team performance, which is used as part of the optimization algorithm that divides students into teams. This function (referred to as a team evaluation heuristic) serves as an approximation to team performance, which is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to quantitatively assess in many settings and that cannot be accurately calculated prior to the task at hand. Despite showing their relative success compared to traditional and manual team formation strategies (manually employed by lecturers and teachers), there is a lack of research comparing team evaluation heuristics in a real classroom setting. Such a comparison would help teachers, practitioners, and system designers to appropriately select the most suitable team formation algorithms. In this article, we present an experimental evaluation that was carried out in a Bachelor's Degree Program in Tourism that compares two team evaluation heuristics based on Belbin and Myer-Briggs. The experimental evaluation was carried out by means of an intelligent, extensible team formation tool whose optimization is based on an integer linear model that can be extended to support different team evaluation heuristics.

AB This paper presents a framework for designing a closed-loop green supply chain network (CLGSCN) that incorporates a redundancy strategy for maximum reliability and eco-friendliness. The network consists of production centers, repairs, and spare parts, with maintenance outsourced to ensure that spare parts circulate within the network for as long as possible. The proposed multi-objective mixed-integer program considers environmental considerations, service costs, routing decisions, cycle times, and assignments, with active and cold standby strategies for maximum reliability. A hybrid heuristics algorithm and multi-choice meta-goal programming with utility function are applied to solve the multi-objective model. The case study demonstrates the applicability of the model in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for optimized spare-part supply for maintenance and delivery. Sensitivity analyses show that the objectives are highly sensitive to the parameters, including the failure rate, demand, and reliability of the components, and results show an approximate decrease of 15.3% in the total cost and an increase of 2.83% in eco-friendly parts and finally increase of 11.25% in reliability with active standby strategy. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of supply chain management for advanced manufacturing systems both theoretically and practically, with potential benefits for businesses and society.

AB To effectively solve the problems of human occlusion and motion blur in pose estimation algorithms, this paper proposes a bottom-up method for multi-person pose estimation based on human anchor joints and perception-enhancement networks. First, in terms of the detection task label, we divide human joint points into two groups-upper body and lower body-and then select two geometric anchor joint points from the two groups as joint point matching clues. Then, the other joint points of each group are represented by offset embedding of the joint point matching clues. Furthermore, two directional anchor joints that are rich in human orientation information are added to constitute a set of human anchor joints and form a new network detection target. Second, we design a perception-enhancement network based on the attention mechanism and feature fusion strategy, which can help the network effectively learn the unique features of each half-body and the inherent consistent features of the whole body. The proposed network has a stronger detection task modelling ability. In the test phase, based on the greedy strategy, the postprocessing algorithm is carried out to obtain the pose estimation results of multiple people by the final joint extraction and matching. The experimental results on the MPII dataset and CrowdPose dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is open source and available online (https://github.com/Ozone-oo/perception_ enhancement_network.git).

ID RULE
AB Ontological reasoning has great prospects in applications based on domain-specific knowledge graphs (KG). However, it is difficult for existing logic reasoners to quickly perform inference over large-scale assertional boxes (ABoxes) in domain-specific KGs with complex ontologies. To address this challenge, a novel method named the "neural-symbolic ontological reasoner" is proposed. By incorporating neural-symbolic learning into ABox reasoning, a reasoner named the TimGangReasoner (TGR) is built. The TGR synthesizes graph data using an ontology, trains an ABox reasoning network (ABRN) model, and then approximately compiles the logic reasoning process of the ontology (represented by OWL+SWRL) into neural networks (NNs). The ABRN model encodes instances into vectors and then executes parallel vector computations to accelerate ABox reasoning. Experiments conducted on three open-source complex ontologies show that the TGR can achieve high-quality approximate deductive reasoning on ABoxes. The reasoning time consumption of the TGR increases linearly with the increase in the number of assertions, providing better scalability for large-scale ABoxes. Therefore, the TGR is able to reason quickly and accurately on domain-specific KGs that have complex underlying ontologies and contain large-scale ABoxes.

AB To address the difficulty of determining a clear-cut boundary of a cluster, three-way clustering methods search for a new type of cluster structure characterized by a pair of a core region with tightly connected objects and a fringe region with relatively loosely connected objects. The density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm is a noniterative process that does not require a predetermined number of clusters. In this paper, taking advantage of these two classes of clustering methods, we propose a new three-way adaptive density peak clustering (3W-ADPC) method. The main contribution of proposed method is that the 3W-ADPC algorithm can adaptively select the most applicable neighbor (i.e., the natural nearest neighbor) for each sample and does not need the parameter of a cutoff distance threshold based on two improved definitions of local density and local distance. In other words, 3W-ADPC is a parameter-free three-way clustering algorithm. The experimental results show that the 3W-ADPC algorithm can not only provide an explainable clustering structure, but also has good performances.

ID DIVERSITY
AB In fuzzy clustering ensemble, the quality of fuzzy base clustering has an important influence on the performance of the final clustering result. Due to the performance of fuzzy clustering is affected by the initial parameters and fuzzy factors, it may cause unstable clustering results such as unsatisfactory data affiliation, and large differences with the distribution of the real data set. In addition, how to use fuzzy ensemble information to determine the similarity among samples effectively plays a crucial role in the generation of co-association matrix elements. In view of the above problems, combined with the compactness, separation and overlap in the evaluation index of fuzzy clustering, an optimized fuzzy clustering evaluation index is designed to select high quality fuzzy base clustering members to participate the final fusion. Then, the concept of sample attribution clarity is proposed, and the attribution clarity of each sample in the fuzzy base clustering set is learned actively. For samples with different attribution clarity, different full-link similarity measurement methods between samples are designed to further reduce the uncertainty of samples. Finally, the clustering results are obtained by the agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, ten data sets are used to conduct experiments. Experiments show that the results obtained by the proposed method are closer to the real distribution structure of the data set in most experimental dataset, and are not sensitive to the diversity of base clustering members, and have good robustness.

AB Clustering high-dimensional data is very challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this problem, low-rank matrix approximations are widely used to identify the underlying low-dimensional structure of a dataset. Among these, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the most popular because its decomposed factors are nonnegative and meaningful. However, the NMF problem has been proved to be nonconvex and NP-hard, thus resulting in many local minima. To obtain high-quality local minima, we propose an entropy regularized fuzzy nonnegative matrix factorization (ERF-NMF) model for high-dimensional data fuzzy clustering. First, probability simplex constraints on the decomposed weight components are added to achieve dimension reduction and fuzzy clustering of a dataset simultaneously. Based on the constraints, we also introduce entropy regularization to further reduce the search space for optimal solutions. Finally, we present multiplicative update rules for solving the ERF-NMF model and provide a complexity and convergence analysis. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed ERF-NMF performs remarkably well with promising results, and its decomposition will be sparser because of entropy regularization and have a clearer physical meaning because of probability simplex constraints.

AB Machine learning neural network (NN) algorithms are being applied for the past few years in all engineering and science domain, economic sectors, image processing synthesis and analysis, and so on. Due to this, this paper work considered employing these machine learning neural models for forecasting application in respect of renewable energy applications and in particular focused on the forecasting of wind speed. It is crucial for power grid dispatchability, stability, and controllability, and its precision is necessary for making the most use of wind resources. This article describes the development of a novel hybrid forecasting system to anticipate the wind speed of real-time wind farm datasets using a hybrid probabilistic neural network (PNN) model and optimization method. The particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ant lion optimization technique is utilized to modify the designed adaptive PNN in order to optimize the weight parameters. The machine learning model employed in this study is an adaptive PNN with a probability density function and a decision-making function that adhere to Bayes' rule to achieve faster convergence and higher prediction accuracy. The obtained simulation results show that the recommended hybrid optimized PNN model outperforms the other techniques that were evaluated and compared from the literature. This establishes that the built optimized adaptive PNN model is applicable and suitable to serve as a predictor, as shown by the outcome of the statistical analysis.

AB As deep learning evolves, neural network structures become increasingly sophisticated, bringing a series of new optimisation challenges. For example, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Training neural networks under privacy constraints is a method to alleviate privacy leakage, and one way to do this is to add noise to the gradient. However, the existing optimisers suffer from weak convergence in the presence of increased noise during training, which leads to a low robustness of the optimiser. To stabilise and improve the convergence of DNNs, the authors propose a neural dynamics (ND) optimiser, which is inspired by the zeroing neural dynamics originated from zeroing neural networks. The authors first analyse the relationship between DNNs and control systems. Then, the authors construct the ND optimiser to update network parameters. Moreover, the proposed ND optimiser alleviates the non-convergence problem that may be suffered by adding noise to the gradient from different scenarios. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on different neural network structures, including ResNet18, ResNet34, Inception-v3, MobileNet, and long and short-term memory network. Comparative results using CIFAR, YouTube Faces, and R8 datasets demonstrate that the ND optimiser improves the accuracy and stability of DNNs under noise-free and noise-polluted conditions.

AB As a sensitive analytical technique, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) has received increasing attention in elemental analysis applications. In this paper, XRF technique coupled with improved variable selection strategy and bayesian optimized support vector regression was proposed for predicting heavy metals in the soil. First of all, an iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) framework was provided to tackle continuous background interference in the XRF spectra of soil. The corrected spectra were then utilized for quantitative analysis of heavy metals. Aiming to implement accurate heavy metal prediction, we resorted to support vector regression (SVR) to establish the non-linear model. Combined with Bayesian optimization algorithm, the bayesian optimized SVR (BO-SVR) with optimal hyperparameters was obtained. However, severe collinearity between input variables can affect the accuracy and stability of the model. Towards this, the research utilized sensitivity analysis as the variable selection approach prior to BO-SVR prediction of XRF data sets. The experimental results revealed that BO-SVR assisted with VMD and sensitivity analysis yielded the best model outcome. Moreover, considerable contributions were observed by employing sensitivity analysis. It showed R2 ������ of 0.9472 (for Cu), 0.7534 (for As), 0.9374 (for Zn), and 0.9283 (for Pb), and RMSEP of 58.0472 (for Cu), 16.5271 (for As), 63.2069 (for Zn) and 64.0662 (for Pb) without using variable selection technique. Resorting to sensitivity analysis, the R2 ������ of Cu, As, Zn and Pb achieved 0.9918, 0.9526, 0.9611 and 0.9541, respectively and the RMSEP of Cu, As, Zn and Pb achieved 22.8803, 11.6868, 38.8753 and 32.9387, respectively. The results of this study clearly illustrated that the proposed model is an effective method for the analysis of heavy metals in soil.

AB The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the selection criteria of supplier companies operating in the defense industry using fuzzy based decision-making models. In the study, supplier selection criteria were constructed through a detailed analysis of numerous studies conducted between 1966 and 2019. Delphi method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are used in the analysis. In the implementation phase, four different companies were determined, then evaluations of experts who with worked with these companies at various times were collected. The q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Set (q-ROFS) based EDAS (Evaluation Based On Distance From Avarage Solution) method is applied in the evaluation stage. The sensitivity analysis is performed among other tests. Results show that, "Performance Criteria" is the only main criteria and "Product Performance", "Quality", "Price", "Sustainability" and "Operational Controls" criteria are the sub-criteria that have significant effects on decision-making. In addition, it has been observed that these criteria affect the logistics performance of the companies. They are also the criteria that experts pay the most attention in purchases to be made. The analysis of past purchases with companies operating in the defense industry, shows that logistics performances of the companies have a positive effect on the customer satisfaction. In this regard, the supplier selection is a highly important issue. The study offers a novel method in determining the supplier selection in the defence industry that can be extended to many other industries. In this way, it opens new research directions in the literature.

AB Feature selection (FS) based on mutual information (MI) metrics needs to discretize the data in prepro-cessing, which is a convenient way to identify correlation between features. However, information loss often occurs in data discretization. In order to solve this information loss problem, this paper proposes a FS algorithm based on cosine similarity coefficient and information measurement criterion (CSCIM_FS). First, the MI between features and tags is calculated, and features are sorted out according to the MI calculated. Then, a feature matrix is constructed to transform the one-dimensional feature sequence into a two-dimensional square matrix. Next, cosine transform is adopted to obtain the high -frequency components of the feature matrix, and sampling is conducted to derive the hash fingerprint of the feature matrix. After that, the similarity between every two features is calculated on the basis of the hash fingerprints of different features. Finally, the feature weight is calculated according to tags, the MI and similarity between features, and a key feature subset is obtained and used to conduct feature selection from the data. The experimental results on several UCI public datasets show that CSCIM_FS algorithm selected a feature subset with high accuracy, and that this algorithm performs better than MIM, CMIM, mRMR and other algorithms. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Non-conformity in Web Images Via a New GENeralized KL Divergence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article

AB Web image datasets curated online inherently contain ambiguous in-distribution instances and out-of-distribution instances, which we collectively call non-conforming (NC) instances. In many recent approaches for mitigating the negative effects of NC instances, the core implicit assumption is that the NC instances can be found via entropy maximization. For "entropy" to be well-defined, we are interpreting the output prediction vector of an instance as the parameter vector of a multinomial random variable, with respect to some trained model with a softmax output layer. Hence, entropy maximization is based on the idealized assumption that NC instances have predictions that are "almost" uniformly distributed. However, in real-world web image datasets, there are numerous NC instances whose predictions are far from being uniformly distributed. To tackle the limitation of entropy maximization, we propose (alpha, beta)-generalized KL divergence, D-KL(alpha, beta) (p parallel to q), which can be used to identify significantly more NC instances. Theoretical properties of D-KL(alpha, beta) (p parallel to q) are proven, and we also show empirically that a simple use of D-KL(alpha, beta) (p parallel to q) outperforms all baselines on the NC instance identification task. Building upon (a, beta)-generalized KL divergence, we also introduce a new iterative training framework, GenKL, that identifies and relabels NC instances. When evaluated on three web image datasets, Clothing1M, Food101/Food101N, and mini WebVision 1.0, we achieved new state-of-the-art classification accuracies: 81.34%, 85.73% and 78.99%/92.54% (top-1/top-5), respectively.

DE Regression; Severe noises; Robust; Feature selection; Face recognition
ID FACE RECOGNITION; SELECTION
AB Up to now, the inaccurate supervision problem caused by label noises poses a big challenge for regression modeling. Regularized noise-robust models provide a valid way for dealing with label noises in regression tasks. They generally use robust losses to cope with label noises and further enhance model robustness by feature selection. But most of them may not work well on data sets contaminated by severe noises (whose magnitudes are extreme), because severe noises do not coincide with their noise assumptions. To address this concern, this paper proposes a robust adaptive linear regression method named TC-ALASSO (Truncated Cauchy Adaptive LASSO), in which model learning and feature selection are finished simultaneously. The fat-tailed Cauchy distribution and truncation theory are adopted to deal with moderate noises and identified extreme noises, respectively, and construct the Truncated Cauchy loss for regression tasks. Moreover, TC-ALASSO applies the adaptive regularizer to finish feature selection well. Note that its adaptive regularizer weights are acquired according to regression coefficient estimations under the truncated Cauchy loss. We also theoretically analyze the robustness of proposed TC-ALASSO in this paper. The experimental results on artificial and benchmark data sets all confirm the robustness and effectiveness of TC-ALASSO. In addition, experimental results on face recognition databases validate the performance advantage of TC-ALASSO over state-of-the-art methods in dealing with extreme illumination variations.

AB Ontologies store semantic knowledge in a machine-readable way and represent domain knowledge in controlled vocabulary. In this work, a workflow is set up to derive classes from a text dataset using natural language processing (NLP) methods. Furthermore, ontologies and thesauri are browsed for those classes and corresponding existing textual definitions are extracted. A base ontology is selected to be extended with knowledge from catalysis science, while word similarity is used to introduce new classes to the ontology based on the class candidates. Relations are introduced to automatically reference them to already existing classes in the selected ontology. The workflow is conducted for a text dataset related to catalysis research on methanation of CO2 and seven semantic artifacts assisting ontology extension by domain experts. Undefined concepts and unstructured relations can be more easily introduced automatically into existing ontologies. Domain experts can then revise the resulting extended ontology by choosing the best fitting definition of a class and specifying suggested relations between concepts of catalyst research. A structured extension of ontologies supported by NLP methods is made possible to facilitate a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data management workflow.

AB Complex process models can hinder the comprehension of the underlying business processes. While several metrics have been suggested in the literature to evaluate the complexity of imperative process models, little is known about their declarative counterparts. In this paper, we address this gap through a suite of metrics that we propose to capture the complexity of declarative process models. Following this, we empirically investigate the impact of complexity, as measured by the suggested metrics, on users' cognitive load when comprehending declarative process models. Therein, we use a multi-modal approach including eye-tracking and electrodermal activity. The findings of the empirical study provide evidence about the cognitive load emerging as a result of increased model complexity. Overall, the outcome of this paper presents empirically validated metrics to evaluate the complexity of declarative process models. Implementing these metrics and incorporating them in intelligent modeling tools would help assessing the complexity of declarative process models before being deployed. Furthermore, our empirical approach can be adopted by researchers in upcoming empirical studies to provide a multi-perspective assessment of users' cognitive load when engaging with process models.

AB In recent years, pruning methods have been proposed to reduce the size of image classification models based on CNNs and to shorten their inference times. However, most of them are based on setting the less important parameters of the model to zero, but not on reshaping the network. Therefore, in this paper we propose a pruning methodology for sequential CNNs that modifies the shape of the network (both convolutional and fully connected layers) and was applied to four sequential networks (a custom, AlexNet, VGG11 and VGG16) for the "Original and counterfeit Colombian peso banknotes"dataset. The pruned models were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. First, in terms of accuracy against FLOPs and parameter reduction. Second, using HiResCAM to explain the patterns on which the model is based for decision making. Quantitative results show a reduction in parameters and FLOPs of about 75% for a reduction in accuracy of up to 0.5% across all models in this study. With larger reductions of about 95%, the AlexNet-pruned and VGG16-pruned models significantly reduced their accuracy (38.1% and 21.9%, respectively), while the custom-pruned model and the VGG11-pruned model reduced their accuracy by only 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Furthermore, using HiResCAM, it was observed that the custom-pruned model and the VGG11-pruned model better preserved the original model activations, even at high pruning percentages, and achieved lower accuracy reductions than their competitors. With the proposed methodology, any sequential model can be pruned and reshaped while largely retaining the accuracy of the unpruned model, or even improving it for low pruning percentages.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in the medical image community, contributing to automatic ophthalmic screening systems for some common diseases. However, the incidence of fundus diseases patterns exhibits a typical long-tailed distribution. In clinic, a small number of common fundus diseases have sufficient observed cases for large-scale analysis while most of the fundus diseases are infrequent. For these rare diseases with extremely low-data regimes, it is challenging to train DNNs to realize automatic diagnosis. In this work, we develop an automatic diagnosis system for rare fundus diseases, based on the meta-learning framework. The system incorporates a co-regularization loss and the ensemble-learning strategy into the meta-learning framework, fully leveraging the advantage of multi-scale hierarchical feature embedding. We initially conduct comparative experiments on our newly-constructed lightweight multi-disease fundus images dataset for the few-shot recognition task (namely, FundusData-FS). Moreover, we verify the cross-domain transferability from miniImageNet to FundusData-FS, and further confirm our method's good repeatability. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our method can detect rare fundus diseases, and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. These investigations demonstrate that the potential of our method for the real clinical practice is promising.

AB This work addresses multiple unmanned surface vessel (USV) scheduling problems with minimizing maximum completion time. First, a mathematical model is developed with considering battery capacity and uncertain mapping time. Second, meta-heuristics and Q-learning are combined for solving the concerned problems. Based on the feature of USV scheduling problems, six heuristic rules are designed to obtain high-quality initializing solutions. According to the structure of solution space, six local search operators are designed. Q-learning is employed to select a premium local search operator in each iteration for improving the search efficiency of meta-heuristics. Finally, the performance of the proposed meta-heuristics with Q-learning based local search are verified by solving 10 cases with different scales. The experimental results and statistical tests demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithms for solving USVs scheduling problems. The particle swarm optimization with the first Q-learning strategy for local search selection is the best one among all compared algorithms.

ID EFFICIENT
AB Water surface velocity (WSV) is one of the critical parameters in hydrology. The development of non-intrusive measurement of this parameter using cameras is increasing. Traditionally, measuring WSV using a camera utilizes tracking of moving objects on the water surfaces. Recently, another method has emerged that utilizes the movement of water ripples to estimate the WSV. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating WSV based on camera measurements. The authors call this method Temporal Gray-scale Pattern Image (TGPI) since it extracts Gray-scale patterns of pixels of water flow video in the temporal domain using the XOR operator and create new image. The new image pattern formed is then used to predict WSV using predictor. There are four predictors being compared, namely Multiple Input Linear Regression (MILR), Multiple Input Logistic Regression (MILgR), Convolutional Neural Network Regression (CNN-R), and Convolutional Neural Network Classification (CNN-K). CNN-R and CNN-K predict WSV directly from the results of TGPI. Meanwhile, MILR and MILgR predict WSV from five TGPI features. The five features are the Mean and Median of the Histogram, Mean and Median of the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), and the Maximum Mid-Value of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). MILR and CNN-R are predictors for regression problems, so the testing metrics for them are Trend-Line equation and R2 from the predicted WSV and actual values graph. Meanwhile, for MILgR and CNN-K, which are predictors for classification problems, the testing metrics are Confusion Matrix (CM), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. To test the four methods without distinguishing their predictor types, a 2-dimensional histogram graph is used. The data-set used for training and testing is video footage of water flow with known WSV. The WSV measurement points used in this study are 1.7 m/s, 3.1 m/s, and 4.2 m/s. The video dataset and these three points are generated by the Mini Open Channel Water Flow Simulator (MOCWFS) developed by the author in this study. From the comparison results, it can be seen that the classification type predictor is superior to the regression type. For the regression type predictor, MILR is better than CNN-R. Meanwhile, for the classification type, CNN-K is superior to MILgR. The best accuracy produced by CNN-K is 98.4%. Although there are shortcomings, the TGPI method is quite feasible for predict Water Surface Velocity.

AB With the improvement of technology, autonomous mobile robots have become an indispensable part of human life. Since path planning is the crucial part of mobile robots, these paths should be feasible, smooth and collision-free in a certain environment. However, forming desirable paths in a dynamic environment with static and moving obstacles is still a problem in the literature. In this paper, we present a new approach based on the analytic geometry for collision avoidance and the cubic Bezier curve with three shape parameters to obtain global and local paths in a dynamic environment. In this study, the environment for the mobile robot is considered to be a square plane without a grid consisting of several static obstacles in different geometric shapes, a mobile robot, and several dynamic obstacles in the shape of a circle with the same size. Moreover, we expressed the influence of the shape parameters on the optimal path using the objective function defined by the path length. Also, the paths generated by the cubic Bezier curve with three shape parameters and the classical cubic Bezier curve are compared in terms of their path length.

DE Multi -domain recommendation; Contrastive learning; Knowledge graph
AB Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to improve the recommendation performance in all target domains simultaneously by leveraging rich data from relevant domains. However, conventional approaches either only rely on sparse interactions in each separate scenario, or simply combine multiple shared recommendation solutions, resulting in MDR systems still suffering from severely low recommendation accuracy. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel recommendation model called Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for MultiDomain Recommendation over Knowledge Graph (HKGCL). Different from previous MDR models, our HKGCL can treat each relevant domain as a hierarchy in the interaction network. Based on the LightGCN aggregation strategy, a hierarchical message passing mechanism over the knowledge graph is designed to aggregate hierarchical knowledge representations for users and items. Then, a hierarchical node dropping scheme is proposed as our data augmentation technique on different hierarchical views to obtain more self-supervised semantic signals. Subsequently, three graph contrastive learning tasks in multiple and separate domains are proposed to explore domain-shared and domain-specific preference features for target users, respectively. Additionally, a novel Multi-domain Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MBPR) approach is proposed to assist in training our multi-task learning framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our proposed HKGCL over various state-of-the-art baselines, and also verify that the HKGCL can achieve strong performance on sparse interaction scenarios.

For the big data, macro-level life cycle pattern (persistent) is caused by micro-level individual actions. For macrolevel verification, basic assumption is that netizens are allocating limited attentions to limited coexisting online events, which has been supported by our big data from the Weibo platform (N=197,985). For the micro-level, we use agent-based modeling to verify the behavioral rules of Netizens. We set two agent categories (Netizens & Hots), which behave and interact autonomously. Based on multiple-round simulations, we obtained optimal solution outcomes. Besides, we have implemented mutual validation between big data and agent-based modeling, which has not been considered before. Three big data sets have been applied to check both validity and robustness of our solutions. For the dataset A, we use 89 online cases of the Shaanxi Province in China. For the dataset B, we used 147 online cases of the whole China in 2021. For the dataset C, we used 138 online cases under specific topic (the pandemic). It suggests that three optimal solutions have both validity and robustness. As three big data sets have different levels, cases, topics and durations, the model's generality can be well supported. Hence, general behavior pattern of the Netizens can be revealed, which is of great significance for investigating human behavior online. Moreover, our work contains rich managerial implications, which helps to improve social simulation and prediction. Also, our TDS analysis framework can support or inspire other researches.

AB Though deep learning-based diagnosis methods have been extensively researched in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) insulation defects diagnosis. Training a high-precision and robust GIS insulation defect diagnosis model under complex and few-shot conditions remains difficult. To address these issues, a novel hybrid meta-learning for a few-shot GIS insulation defect diagnosis is proposed. The meta Siamese network (MSN) is designed by incorporating the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) into the Siamese network (SN). Firstly, a SN is designed to acquire knowledge of GIS insulation defect diagnosis. To capture the discriminative characteristics, the attention mechanism is introduced into SN to reduce the attention to irrelevant information. Then, the model parameters are optimized through MAML. To ensure the model's optimal performance, the meta-stochastic gradient descent is introduced to realize optimizer learning in an end-to-end form. The experimental results show that when the support sets is 5, MSN can achieve 93.15% accuracy, which outperforms other methods. Furthermore, the issue of unbalanced samples is effectively avoided, providing a feasible solution for the fewshot GIS insulation defects.

AB Emotion recognition based on facial expressions has low accuracy and doubtful reliability because of the exis-tence of fake expressions. In this paper, a method is proposed to recognize fake emotions based on multivisual information generated from single information sources, including facial expressions, eye states and physiological signals captured from video. An algorithm based on a graph neural network is used to extract spatial and spectral domain features from facial images for facial expression recognition. A model-based method is used for decomposing RGB signals into heart rates. A deep model trained by a labeled dataset that we created is used to segment the eye region. After obtaining the signals extracted from video, different fusion strategies are applied to evaluate emotion recognition performance based on multiple signals. In the experiment, the CK+, TFEID, JAFFE, RAF, PURE, and ESLD datasets are used to measure the accuracy of facial expression recognition, heart rate detection and eye region segmentation. The results show that multimodality is effective in improving accuracy and that eye state can be considered a cue for trusted emotion recognition. Compared with the method based on the eye state and noncontact physiological signal, the accuracy of multimodality can be improved by 26.19% and 9.52%, respectively.

AB Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing the missing regions in diverse imaging as well as graphic appli-cations which includes object elimination, image restoration, as well as manipulation. Although various deep learning techniques have attained a notable progress in restoration of images, because of local nature of different operations, they cannot effectively capture both global as well as semantic information, leading to issues such as structural ambiguity and semantic incompleteness, particularly for larger missing areas. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a novel Transformer-based self-supervised attention-generating adversarial image painting method that leverages the Transformer's self-attention strategy to capture global semantic data. The proposed technique establishes a self-supervised attention module in the Transformer to overcome the limitations of convolutional operations. Additionally, a hierarchical Swin Transformer with a shift window is used in the discriminator to remove the image's contextual features, while semantic feature learning is per -formed using the transformer structure. The generator also employs a depthwise over-parameterized convolu-tional layer (DO-Conv) to extract features and enhance model performance. The experimental evaluations are carried out and result analysis demonstrated that the proposed technique outperformed various other existing approaches. Overall, the proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the Transformer-based generative adversarial network structure over the full convolution approach.

AB Disaster response is a major challenge given the social and economic impact on the communities affected by disaster incidents. We investigate how coalition formation can be used for the problem of forming a hierarchy of resources (e.g., personnel responding to the incident). As a case study, we consider the roaring river flood scenario and model the Incident Command System (ICS) framework-providing guidelines on cooperatively responding to disaster incidents. Our approach is based on sequential characteristic-function games induced by size-based valuation structures. We show that this approach can deliver a hierarchy as required by the Operations Section of the ICS and provides a promising way to generate practical solutions for some realistic disaster scenarios.

AB : In many applications, data samples contain incorrect labels due to data quality issues and the high cost of labeling. Although current noise-resistant classification algorithms can handle specific types of label noise, identifying the type of noise present in the given data is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a robust classification method called LapRamp, which works with multiple types of label noise. LapRamp utilizes the ramp loss function to minimize the impact of mislabeled samples far from the discriminant surface. Additionally, we incorporate manifold regularization to capture the inherent geometric structure of the data. We analyze the generalization error bound of the model in terms of Rademacher complexity, and the preliminary experimental results indicate that LapRamp has good generalization performance despite the presence of mixed label noise. Furthermore, it demonstrates stable classification accuracy when dealing with noisy labels in various scenarios.

AB Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is frequently used in time series modeling with satisfactory results is commonly used for predicting stock prices in many studies. Due to its more transparent structure than most of the current Neural Network (NN) models and its sensitivity to the initial parameter settings, we propose a hybrid model that combines Recurrent NN (RNN) and HMM in modeling stock prices to eliminate initial parameter influence. Despite its common application to speech recognition data with categorical variables, we reconstruct RNN and HMM for financial data. RNN is used as a solution to the probability of not reaching the global maximum based on the HMM's initial parameters selection. To do so, we improve the classification power of HMM to achieve the hidden states that do not get stuck at a local maximum but provide the global maximum. In addition, unlike the literature, the loss function is not chosen as the maximum likelihood but is defined directly over the prices. Thus, the model does not only detect the states appropriately, yet the predictions can get closer to the actual prices. Besides, a multivariate comparison is performed to determine the effect of different numbers and types of variables through bivariate and trivariate models. The application is made on S & P 500, Nasdaq daily closing prices and daily EUR/USD exchange rates data from 2000 to 2021. It is shown that the accuracy is increased significantly compared to the implementations of HMM and RNN methods separately.

AB Four-dimensional (4D) light-field (LF) microscopes can acquire 3D information about target objects using a microlens array (MLA). However, the resolution and quality of sub-images in the LF images are reduced because of the spatial multiplexing of rays by the element lenses of the MLA. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an LF one-shot learning technique that can convert LF sub-images into high-quality images similar to the 2D images of conventional optical microscopes obtained without any external training datasets for image enhancement. The proposed convolutional neural network model was trained using only one training dataset comprising a high-resolution reference image captured without an MLA as the ground truth. Further, its input was the central view of the LF image. After LF one-shot learning, the trained model should be able to convert well the other LF sub-images of various directional views that were not used in the main training process. Therefore, novel learning techniques were designed for LF one-shot learning. These novel techniques include an autoencoder-based model initialization method, a feature map-based learning algorithm to prevent the overfitting of the model, and cut loss to prevent saturation. The experimental results verified that the proposed technique effectively enhances the LF image quality and resolution using a reference image. Moreover, this method enhances the resolution by up to 13 times, decreases the noise amplification effect, and restores the lost details of microscopic objects. The proposed technique is stable and yields superior experimental results compared with those of the existing resolution-enhancing methods.

TI Dimensionality reduction by t-Distribution adaptive manifold embedding

DE Dimensionality reduction; t-Distribution; Manifold learning
AB High-dimensional data are difficult to explore and analyze due to they are highly correlative and redundant. Although previous dimensionality reduction methods have achieved promising performance, there are still some limitations. For example, the constructed distribution of data in the embedding space could not be approximated adaptively, and the parameters in these model lack of interpretation. To handle these problems, in this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction method named t-Distribution Adaptive Manifold Embedding (t-AME) is proposed. Firstly, t-AME constructs the pairwise distance similarity probability in the embedding space by Student-t distribution, and distributions generated by different degrees of freedom are learned according to the data itself to better match high-dimensional data distributions. Afterwards, to pull similar points together and push apart dissimilar points, an objective function with the corresponding optimization strategy is designed. Therefore, both the local and global structure of the original data could be well preserved in the embedding space. Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement over some representative and state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Tensor factorization has been widely applied in computer vision and machine learning area. Nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) is a popular tensor factorization technique. However, it neglects the geometrical structure of the data space and the available label information of sample data, lowering the data representation performance. To overcome this defect, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised NTD method, named graph regularized discriminative nonnegative Tucker decomposition (GDNTD), which incorporates the graph construction of the data space and the available label information of the sample data into NTD. Specifically, a graph construction is utilized to preserve the geometric structure between data by a graph regularization term. Then, a label matrix is presented for guiding the data representation by a label constraint regularization term. Finally, based on the NTD property of maintaining the internal structure of data, the graph regularizer and the label regularizer are integrated into NTD to generate the proposed method. Thus, GDNTD can extract the part-based representation, preserve the local geometrical structure of the data space, and improve the discriminative ability of the learned model simultaneously, greatly boosting the model's data representation performance. We test the proposed method through a set of evaluations on four image datasets. Experimental results show that the GDNTD method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its strong potential for data representation.

ID DICTIONARY REPRESENTATION; TRAINING IMAGE; ROBUST; FUSION; FEATURES
AB Face recognition has become popular in the last few decades among researchers across the globe due to its applicability in several domains. This problem becomes more challenging when only a single training image is available and is popularly known as single sample face recognition (SSFR) problem. SSFR becomes even more complex when images are captured under varying illumination conditions, different poses, occlusion, and expression. Further, deep learning methods have shown performance at par with humans recently. Due to the emergence of deep learning methods in the last decade, it has been made possible to recognize faces with excellent accuracy even in a single sample scenario. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of SSFR using deep learning. We also propose a novel taxonomy and broadly divide these methods into three categories viz. virtual sample generation, feature-based, and hybrid methods. Performance comparison of these methods as reported in the literature has also been performed. Finally, we review publicly available databases used by the researchers and give some important future research directions which will help aspiring researchers in this fascinating area.

AB Manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) tends to get trapped in local optima as it relies on the direction provided by the previous individual and the best individual as guidance to search for the optimal solution. As enriching population diversity can effectively solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical structure and weighted fitness-distance balance selection to improve the population diversity of the algorithm. The hierarchical structure allows individuals in different groups of the population to search for optimal solutions in different places, expanding the diversity of solutions. In MRFO, greedy selection based solely on fitness can lead to local solutions. We innovatively incorporate a distance metric into the selection strategy to increase selection diversity and find better solutions. A hierarchical manta ray foraging optimization with weighted fitness-distance balance selection (HMRFO) is proposed. Experimental results on IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017 (CEC2017) functions show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to seven competitive algorithms, and the proposed method has little effect on the algorithm complexity of MRFO. The application of HMRFO to optimize real-world problems with large dimensions has also obtained good results, and the computational time is very short, making it a powerful alternative for very high-dimensional problems. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is further verified by analyzing the population diversity of HMRFO.

AB With the development of industry, more and more crucial mechanical machinery generate wildness demand of effective fault diagnosis to ensure the safe operation. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored and developed a variety of approaches. In recent years, fault diagnosis based on deep learning has developed rapidly, which achieved satisfied results in the filed of mechanical equipment fault diagnosis. However, there is few review to systematically summarize and sort out these special image deep learning methods. In order to fill this gap, this paper concentrates on reviewing comprehensively the development of special image deep learning for mechanical equipment fault diagnosis in past 5 years. In general, a typical image fault diagnosis based on fault image deep learning generally consists of data acquisition, signal processing, model construction, feature learning and decision-making. Firstly, the method of signal preprocessing is introduced, and several common methods of converting signals into images are briefly compared and analyzed. Then, the principles and variants of deep learning models are expounded. Further more, the difficulties and challenges encountered at this stage are summarized. Last but not least, the future development and potential trends of the work are concluded, and it hoped that this work will facilitate and inspire further exploration for researchers in this area.

We show how to associate with the steps of the algorithm geometrical extensions of substitutions, i.e., rules that replace faces by unions of faces, to build finite sets called patterns. We examine several of their combinatorial, geometrical and topological properties. This work is a first step toward the incremental computation of patterns that locally fit a digital surface for the accurate approximation of tangent planes.

TI Smart City Facility Location Recommendation Algorithm Using Multimedia
   Data and Improved Generative Adversarial Networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB Internet of Things, low energy consumption, and intelligent and functionally integrated urban infrastructure construction are crucial elements in the development of smart cities. Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network. Furthermore, it enhances the computational efficiency of the planning problem associated with distributed power supply and electric vehicle charging stations. The findings of this research hold substantial research significance for the site selection planning of distributed power supply.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight online-trained video object segmentation network. Specifically, to force the network focus on the potential object, we propose a new way to guide the encoder module by classification score map, and integrate a cross-dimension attention into the refinement segmentation module. Meanwhile, to reduce the negative influence of unreliable samples, we use two indexes to adaptively choose templates for the memory module. Experiments were conducted on three popular benchmarks, and our approach has achieved a good trade-off between accuracy and speed.

AB This paper studied the general decay synchronization (GDS) of fuzzy inertial memristive neural networks (FIMNNs) with mixed delays and discontinuous activation function. Firstly, in light of the Filippov regularization method and a few prerequisites, a new Lemma is generated and it is then applied to the issues in this study. Secondly, the GDS of FIMNNs were investigated by devising two distinct nonlinear controllers, and several new criteria for insuring GDS are derived by using inequality transformation and Lyapunov functional method. Lastly, several simulation examples indicate correctness of the conclusion.

ID STRATEGY
AB This paper explores the knowledge network structure of foreign research literature by applying the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to the field of information science and library science (ISLS) from the perspective of the cocitation of social network actors such as authors, institutions, countries, and literature, and it further reveals the future application trends of this method. [Method/process] Based on 86 journals in the ISLS field that were downloaded from the Web of Science using the QCA method, the social network analysis (SNA) method and the visual analysis tool Gephi are used to analyse the author cooperation network, the research institution cooperation network, the national cooperation network, the cocitation network, the cutting-edge trends, etc., of journal papers. The analysis shows that the QCA method covers a wide range within the field of ISLS, but the research topics involved in this field are not concentrated, and the author cooperation network has scale-free characteristics. The application of the QCA method is still dominant in European and American countries, and China, the USA, and Italy all play key roles in the national cooperation network. Finally, the institutional cooperation network has certain small group attributes.

ID PRICE ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION
AB Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem in which a network of customers with specified demands is given. The objective is to find a set of routes which originates as well as terminates at the depot node. These routes are to be traversed in such a way that the demands of all the customers in the network are satisfied and the cost associated with traversal of these routes come out to be a minimum. In real-world situations, the demand of any commodity depends upon various uncontrollable factors, such as season, delivery time, and market conditions. Due to these factors, the demand can always not be told in advance and a precise information about the demand is nearly impossible to achieve. Hence, the demands of the customers always experience impreciseness and randomness in real life. The decisions made by the customers about the demands may also have some scope of hesitation as well. In order to handle such demands of customers in the network, fuzzy random variables and intuitionistic fuzzy random variables are used in this work. The work bridges the gap between the classical version of CVRP and the real-life situation and hence makes it easier for the logistic management companies to determine the routes that should be followed for minimum operational cost and maximum profit. Mathematical models corresponding to CVRP with fuzzy stochastic demands (CVRPFSD) and CVRP with intuitionistic fuzzy stochastic demands (CVRPIFSD) have been presented. A two-stage model has been proposed to find out the solution for the same. To explain the working of the methodology defined in this work, different examples of networks with fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy demands have been worked out. The proposed solution approach is also tested on modified fuzzy stochastic versions of some benchmark instances.

AB In this paper, we study option contracts for emergency material reserves due to unexpected events. Contingencies occur randomly and the amount of realization cannot be known until it breaks out. Therefore, it is important to stockpile some necessary supplies in advance. However, a large advance stockpile on the demand side would incur low-carbon disposal costs, which are not economical. Also, the supplier will have no incentive to stockpile for the demander due to low carbon disposal costs and production costs. Therefore, we propose a contractual approach with option to stimulate supplier to stockpile for his client. Three models are discussed based on the consideration of low-carbon disposal costs: a centralized decision case, a non-option decentralized case, and a decentralized case with option. The outcomes demonstrate that the number of first orders under the decentralized case without option is less than the order quantity under the centralized case. Moreover, the size of the first purchase volume in all three cases depends on the both parties' practical factors. Meanwhile, the reasonable interval of option fee is obtained by analysis.

AB A decentralized dynamic event-triggered tracking control problem is investigated for a class of p-normal interconnected time-delay nonlinear systems with asymmetric constraints. First, a new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is constructed by designing a dynamic variable law, which effectively reduces the number of controller updates. The introduced constants provide an obvious solution for the proof of Zeno phenomenon. Second, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed with the help of sign functions to achieve time-varying asymmetric constraints. Meanwhile, we improve the previous neural networks (NNs) approximation scheme and dynamic gain technique in order to handle unknown interconnection functions and time-delay signals, respectively. Then, it is rigorously proved that all signals in the system are bounded, and the error signals are constrained within the time-varying asymmetric bounds. Finally, the feasibility of the scheme is verified by simulation examples. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID HANDLING MISSING DATA
AB As the widely deployment of different sensors and Internet of Things, a large volume of multivariate time series has been collected. However, there are many missing values in the multivariate time series due to different reasons, such as sensor damage, environmental intrusion and machine failure. These missing values bring challenges to further analysis of multivariate time series. The existing methods for multivariate time series imputation either destroy the properties of the original data or fail to capture the correlations of the data effectively. In order to solve the problems in existing methods, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Specifically, we use Auto-Encoder (AE) as the generator (G), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as the discriminator (D). Taking advantages of generative adversarial networks to impute the incomplete multivariate time series data. In addition, Attention Mechanism is integrated to the structure of the Encoder and Decoder to keep the correlations among data. By integrating the advantages of Attention Mechanism, it enables the generator to take advantage of the internal features of the original data when imputing the data. Therefore, the imputed multivariate time series are more reasonable and reliable. Furthermore, we also improve our model by integrating Self-Attention Mechanism to improve the accuracy for multivariate time series imputation. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model exceeds existing models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Texture analysis is a classical yet challenging task in computer vision for which deep neural networks are actively being applied. Most approaches are based on building feature aggregation modules around a pre-trained backbone and then fine-tuning the new architecture on specific texture recognition tasks. Here we propose a new method named Random encoding of Aggregated Deep Activation Maps (RADAM) which extracts rich texture representations without ever changing the backbone. The technique consists of encoding the output at different depths of a pre-trained deep convolutional network using a Random-ized Autoencoder (RAE). The RAE is trained locally to each image using a closed-form solution, and its decoder weights are used to compose a 1-dimensional texture representation that is fed into a linear SVM. This means that no fine-tuning or backpropagation is needed for the backbone. We explore RADAM on several texture benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results with different com putational budgets. Our results suggest that pre-trained backbones may not require additional fine-tuning for texture recog-nition if their learned representations are better encoded. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Functional heterogeneity of healthy human tissues complicates interpretation of molecular studies, impeding precision therapeutic target identification and treatment. Considering this, we generated a graph neural network with Reactome-based architecture and trained it using 9,115 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Our graph neural network (GNN) achieves adjusted Rand index (ARI) = 0.7909, while a Resnet18 control model achieves ARI = 0.7781, on 370 held-out healthy human tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), despite the Resnet18 using over 600 times the parameters. Our GNN also succeeds in separating 83 healthy skin samples from 95 lesional psoriasis samples, revealing that upregulation of 26S-and NUB1-mediated degradation of NEDD8, UBD, and their conjugates is central to the largest perturbed reaction network component in psoriasis. We show that our results are not discoverable using traditional differential expression and hypergeometric pathway enrichment analyses yet are supported by separate human multi-omics and small-molecule mouse studies, suggesting future molecular disease studies may benefit from similar GNN analytical approaches.

AB Averting dangerous climate change requires expediting the retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). Given multiple barriers hampering this, here we forecast the future retirement ages of the world's CFPPs. We use supervised machine learning to first learn from the past, determining the factors that influenced historical retirements. We then apply our model to a dataset of 6,541 operating or under-construction units in 66 countries. Based on results, we also forecast associated carbon emissions and the degree to which countries are locked in to coal power. Contrasting with the historical average of roughly 40 years over 2010-2021, our model forecasts earlier retirement for 63% of current CFPP units. This results in 38% less emissions than if assuming historical retirement trends. However, the lock-in index forecasts considerable difficulties to retire CFPPs early in countries with high dependence on coal power, a large capacity or number of units, and young plant ages.

AB To ensure equitable quality of care, differences in machine learning model performance between patient groups must be addressed. Here, we argue that two separate mechanisms can cause performance differences between groups. First, model performance may be worse than theoretically achievable in a given group. This can occur due to a combination of group underrepresentation, modeling choices, and the characteristics of the prediction task at hand. We examine scenarios in which underrepresentation leads to underperformance, scenarios in which it does not, and the differences between them. Second, the optimal achievable performance may also differ between groups due to differences in the intrinsic difficulty of the prediction task. We discuss several possible causes of such differences in task difficulty. In addition, challenges such as label biases and selection biases may confound both learning and performance evaluation. We highlight consequences for the path toward equal performance, and we emphasize that leveling up model performance may require gathering not only more data from underperforming groups but also better data. Throughout, we ground our discussion in real-world medical phenomena and case studies while also referencing relevant statistical theory.

DT Article
ID HUMAN BRAIN
AB Neuroimaging-based predictive models continue to improve in performance, yet a widely overlooked aspect of these models is "trustworthiness,"or robustness to data manipulations. High trustworthiness is imperative for researchers to have confidence in their findings and interpretations. In this work, we used functional connectomes to explore how minor data manipulations influence machine learning predic-tions. These manipulations included a method to falsely enhance prediction performance and adversarial noise attacks designed to degrade performance. Although these data manipulations drastically changed model performance, the original and manipulated data were extremely similar (r = 0.99) and did not affect other downstream analysis. Essentially, connectome data could be inconspicuously modified to achieve any desired prediction performance. Overall, our enhancement attacks and evaluation of existing adversarial noise attacks in connectome-based models highlight the need for counter-measures that improve the trustworthiness to preserve the integrity of academic research and any potential translational applications.

AB Compliance issues riddle the agricultural sector despite being an essential industry for the human race. Many factors contribute to compliance issues; however, meat cut label verification is one of the most critical concerns due to its erroneous nature. In addition, meat cut identification is complex for the human eye. Thus, access to a skilled labor force is challenging. Nevertheless, meat compliance is essential since it has export compliance ramifications. These factors, along with others, are pushing for a digital alternative. An alternative that can augment human decision-making in verifying meat cut box labels. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a digital alternative that can boost quality assurance tasks. One of AI's potential quality assurance solutions is a Meat Box Labeling Verification (BLV) solution that can verify the boxed meat type against the label to ensure no mismatch. Two major components make up the BLV solution: Meat Identification and Label Analysis. This work aims to solve the former component by exploring different meat-type identification techniques. It explores them by building, evaluating, and testing different computer vision solutions. Hence, the novel contribution of this work is three folds. We first build, test, and design computer vision solutions that detect meat boxes and pieces accurately. These solutions include deep learning methods in classification and object detection techniques. Following that, we evaluate these models and derive key insights. Such insights are valuable for prototyping such solutions in production environments. For example, classification models achieve a 99% testing accuracy in identifying box types. In contrast, object detection achieved 89% mAP@.5:.95 in identified individual meat cuts. Finally, we prototype an object detection model in a natural meat processing environment-the demonstration showed comparable object detection precision at 85% mAP@.5:.95.

AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable performance in various medical imaging tasks by dint of priors from massive unlabeled data. However, regarding a specific downstream task, there is still a lack of an instruction book on how to select suitable pretext tasks and implementation details throughout the standard "pretrain-then-finetune"workflow. In this work, we focus on exploiting the capacity of SSL in terms of four realistic and significant issues: (1) the impact of SSL on imbalanced datasets, (2) the network architecture, (3) the applicability of upstream tasks to downstream tasks and (4) the stacking effect of SSL and common policies for deep learning. We provide a large-scale, in-depth and fine-grained study through extensive experiments on predictive, contrastive, generative and multi-SSL algorithms. Based on the results, we have uncovered several insights. Positively, SSL advances class-imbalanced learning mainly by boosting the performance of the rare class, which is of interest to clinical diagnosis. Unfortunately, SSL offers marginal or even negative returns in some cases, including severely imbalanced and relatively balanced data regimes, as well as combinations with common training policies. Our intriguing findings provide practical guidelines for the usage of SSL in the medical context and highlight the need for developing universal pretext tasks to accommodate diverse application scenarios.
