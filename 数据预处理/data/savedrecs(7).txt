AB Selecting a few important representatives that could reveal the intrinsic structure of a data set with massive data samples, i.e., subset selection, is very useful for different applications in machine learning and information retrieval domains. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive sparse regression-based subset selection method, termed cost-sensitive sparse subset selection (CS4). CS4 considers the cost of different subsets for the prediction of all the data samples in a given data set and can choose a subset that has minimal prediction cost. Hence, compared to the related sparse regression-based methods, CS4 is capable of selecting the most informative representatives to characterize the structures of data sets. Moreover, we present an optimization algorithm for solving CS4 problem. The convergence and computation complexity of the algorithm have been analyzed. The relationships between CS4 and the related algorithms have been also discussed. Finally, the experiments on representative selection and classification show the effectiveness and superiorities of CS4.

AB Anti-jamming cyclic frequency feature extraction is an important link in identifying communication interference signals, which is of great significance for eliminating electronic communication interference factors and improving the security of electronic communication environment. However, when the traditional feature extraction technology faces a large number of data samples, the processing capacity is low, and it cannot solve the multi-classification problems. For this type of problem, a method of electronic communication signal anti-jamming cyclic frequency feature extraction based on particle swarm optimization-support vector machines (PSO-SVM) algorithm is proposed. First, the SVM signal feature extraction model is proposed, and then the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used. Optimize the kernel function parameter settings of SVM to raise the classifying quality of the SVM model. Finally, the function of the PSO-SVM signal feature extraction model is tested. The results verify that the PSO-SVM model begins to converge after 60 iterations, and the loss value remains at about 0.2, which is 0.2 lower than that of the SVM technique. The exactitude of signal feature extraction is 90.4%, and the recognition effect of binary phase shift keying signal is the best. The complete rate of signal feature extraction is 85%. This shows that the PSO-SVM model enhances the sensitivity of the anti-jamming cyclic frequency feature, improves the accuracy of the anti-jamming cyclic frequency feature recognition, reduces the running process, reduces the time cost, and greatly increases the performance of the SVM method. The good model performance also improves the application value of the method in the field of electronic communication.

ID BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE
AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) establish a direct communication channel between the human brain and external devices. Among various methods, electroencephalography (EEG) stands out as the most popular choice for BCI design due to its non-invasiveness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness. This paper aims to present and compare the accuracy and robustness of an EEG system employing one or two channels. We present both hardware and algorithms for the detection of open and closed eyes. Firstly, we utilize a low-cost hardware device to capture EEG activity from one or two channels. Next, we apply the discrete Fourier transform to analyze the signals in the frequency domain, extracting features from each channel. For classification, we test various well-known techniques, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), or Logistic Regression (LR). To evaluate the system, we conduct experiments, acquiring signals associated with open and closed eyes, and compare the performance between one and two channels. The results demonstrate that employing a system with two channels and using SVM, DT, or LR classifiers enhances robustness compared to a single-channel setup and allows us to achieve an accuracy percentage greater than 95% for both eye states.

AB This paper proposes a graph-based approach to determine the importance of each media in a multimedia document by expanding the traditional four-dimensional model with a dimension that captures the rhetorical relations between different media types. The proposed approach utilizes an algorithm to weight the media types based on their significance. The use of rhetorical structure theory enables the determination of the significance of each media type, making it useful for document adaptation, automatic composition, and automatic generation of summaries. The approach utilizes an extended orbits-based rhetorical structure that is a novel method for determining the importance of media types in multimedia documents. The proposed approach is effective in capturing the importance of each media type and can be utilized in a wide range of applications, making it a potential solution to the limitations of the traditional model. This research has implications for a range of applications, including document adaptation, automatic composition, and automatic generation of summaries.

AB In the age of information deluge, it is pivotal to have access to information or knowledge which is not just relevant but also, novel. Knowledge workers often have to skim through tens or even hundreds of abstracts or articles to identify those novel documents which can enhance their knowledge. While there are personalized recommenders which can provide relevant documents to these knowledge workers, there aren't many systems which can identify 'novel' documents which are relevant. Critical roadblocks in the discovery of novel documents are big, labelled datasets and complex, expensive infrastructure for training models. This work attempts to overcome these roadblocks by proposing an unsupervised classifier based on word associations to predict the novelty of a document based on its content. Evaluation based on a benchmarking dataset TAP-DLND 1.0 has revealed that, the performance of this classifier is comparable to that of many of the state-of-the-art supervised learning techniques including some of the deep learning models. The results can have potential implications in the way NLP researchers approach novelty detection in documents by not having to rely on large, labelled training datasets which are scarce!

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been successfully used to solve the problem of the huge cost of graph data annotation, such as labor cost, time cost, and professional knowledge cost. Recent works have focused on improving the generalization performance of GCL with automated data augmentation. However, GCL methods with automated data augmentation encode the graph representation using fixed graph encoders, which will result in performance loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive graph contrastive learning with joint optimization of data Augmentation and graph Encoder (AdaAE). AdaAE is the first method to learn to adapt the graph encoder for each dataset for GCL with automated data augmentation. Specifically, we design a unified GCL search space, which means that we treat both data augmentation and graph encoder as architecture components. AdaAE employs the adaptive architecture optimizer based on a differentiable search method to learn the sample probability distribution of each architecture component. The adaptive architecture optimizer generates an operation of each architecture component based on the sample probability distribution to construct the GCL model. Then, the validation results of the GCL model are used as the feedback signal of the adaptive architecture optimizer to optimize the sample probability distribution of each architecture component. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaAE performs more superior than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the visualization results confirm that AdaAE can clearly distinguish different classes in the projection space.

AB Graphs are widely used to model real-life information, where graph similarity computation is one of the most significant applications, such as inferring the properties of a compound based on similarity to a known group. Definition methods (e.g., graph edit distance and maximum common subgraph) have extremely high computational cost, and the existing efficient deep learning methods suffer from the problem of inadequate feature extraction which would have a bad effect on similarity computation. In this paper, a double-branch model called DeepSIM was raised to deeply mine graph-level and node-level features to address the above problems. On the graph-level branch, a novel embedding relational reasoning network was presented to obtain interaction between pairwise inputs. Meanwhile, a new local-to-global attention mechanism is designed to improve the capability of CNN-based node-level feature extraction module on another path. In DeepSIM, double-branch outputs will be concatenated as the final feature. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods perform well on several datasets compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models in related fields.

AB Intelligent tutoring systems have been widely used in educational activities over the past 20 years. With significantly less effort put into writing or reading assistance, the majority of intelligent tutoring systems focus on mathematics or problem solving activities. However, with the development of E-reading-centered E-education, how to improve students' learning performance during reading has become increasingly important. Therefore, in this paper, we take a first step in the direction of an adaptive intelligent tutoring system by investigating how different reading strategies relate to knowledge gain based on gaze features and how an embodied social robot affects gaze patterns and reading strategies. The findings showed that different knowledge gains have significant differences in scanning methods and reading depth, and that the feedback given by social robots significantly affects participants' gaze patterns during the whole reading process. To automatically differentiate between two levels of knowledge gain, several prediction experiments based on various reading strategy-related gaze features were carried out. The results demonstrate that saccades are the best predictors of knowledge gain, with the best model having an average accuracy of 74.2%. Finally, real-time simulation experiments were conducted with sixty participants using the leave-one-out method, and an accurate prediction of the level of knowledge gain of 71. 5% was achieved.

   artificial trust
AB A lot of attention has recently been devoted to the notion of Trustworthy AI (TAI). However, the very applicability of the notions of trust and trustworthiness to AI systems has been called into question. A purely epistemic account of trust can hardly ground the distinction between trustworthy and merely reliable AI, while it has been argued that insisting on the importance of the trustee's motivations and goodwill makes the notion of TAI a categorical error. After providing an overview of the debate, we contend that the prevailing views on trust and AI fail to account for the ethically relevant and value-laden aspects of the design and use of AI systems, and we propose an understanding of the notion of TAI that explicitly aims at capturing these aspects. The problems involved in applying trust and trustworthiness to AI systems are overcome by keeping apart trust in AI systems and interpersonal trust. These notions share a conceptual core but should be treated as distinct ones.

AB This paper proposes a reinforcement learning sliding mode strategy for the time-varying formation control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles system. Previous research relied on sliding mode control for swarm coordination, but encountered significant challenges, including the chattering phenomenon and increased energy consumption. To overcome these issues, this work introduces a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages a critic neural network to approximate the performance index function and an actor neural network to redesign the switching control strategy within the traditional sliding mode framework. Additionally, the incorporation of control thresholds ensures the smooth operation of the system when executing time-varying formation tasks. According to the Lyapunov method, the stability is analyzed. The evaluation results indicate that with the proposed reinforcement learning sliding mode controller, the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles system can achieve time-varying formation control well. At the same time, the chattering phenomenon and power consumption characteristics are significantly improved.

AB Human identification using unobtrusive visual features is a daunting task in smart environments. Gait is among adequate biometric features when the camera cannot correctly capture the human face due to environmental factors. In recent years, gait-based human identification using skeleton data has been intensively studied using a variety of feature extractors and more sophisticated deep learning models. Although skeleton data is susceptible to changes in covariate variables, resulting in noisy data, most existing algorithms employ a single feature extraction technique for all frames to generate frame-level feature maps. This results in degraded performance and additional features, necessitating increased computing power. This paper proposes a robust feature extractor that extracts a quantitative summary of gait event-specific information, thereby reducing the total number of features throughout the gait cycle. In addition, a novel Attention-guided LSTM-based deep learning model with residual connections is proposed to learn the extracted features for gait recognition. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art works on five publicly available datasets on various benchmark evaluation protocols and metrics. Further, the CMC test revealed that the proposed model obtained higher than 97% Accuracy in lower-level ranks on these datasets.

AB Multiple variable time series anomaly detection plays a significant role in fields such as AIOps and intelligent healthcare. However, time series often lack labels, and anomalies are infrequent compared to normal sequences. Moreover, high-dimensional nonlinear correlations and substantial distribution variations among variables exist in multivariate time series. These challenges make it difficult for the model to accurately model time series. While contemporary reconstruction-based models address challenges of data scarcity and time series modeling through GAN frameworks, little attention has been given to mitigating the substantial differences in variable distributions among multiple time series. This paper proposes the Variable-wise Generative Adversarial Transformer (VGAT) for achieving unsupervised anomaly detection, with WGAN as the training framework and Transformer as the fundamental structure for the Duplicator and Discriminator. Firstly, VGAT makes the Generator act as the Duplicator, reconstructing samples through direct replication, simplifying the model structure, and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, VGAT employs the Soft-DTW regularization to facilitate a more authentic replication of normal sequences by the Duplicator. Most importantly, VGAT introduces the Variable-wise Gate, dynamically calculating a gate for each variable in the multivariate time series to balance the differences in variable distributions. After VGAT generates anomaly scores, the SPOT algorithm based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) automatically computes the threshold, enhancing the adaptability to different data of the model. VGAT demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, surpassing baselines on public datasets. Notably, as the dimensionality of the series increases, VGAT exhibits more significant improvements. On WADI dataset, VGAT achieves an impressive 68.19% enhancement in F1-score, showcasing remarkable progress compared to the current SOTA model.

AB Multi-task learning has recently inspired a series of fruitful research in the field of recommendation due to its ability to handle complex scenarios by associating information between tasks. However, various information suitable for multi-task recommender systems usually produces different degrees of noise. For example, parameter information suitable for one task will affect other tasks, and the real data that is difficult to observe correctly in Euclidean space may be regarded as noise data. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced multi-task recommendation algorithm in hyperbolic space named KMRH. The algorithm employs the alternate training method to alleviate the parameter noise problem in complex recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we design a novel knowledge enhancement strategy in the Poincare sphere, which exploits hyperbolic embeddings to capture knowledge graphs of complex structured data. Finally, we adopt spatial distance as a metric to distinguish positive and negative samples at different locations, thereby limiting the detrimental impact of noise components on the recommendation model. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements over other state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Recent advancements in the manufacturing and commercialisation of miniaturised sensors and low-cost wearables have enabled an effortless monitoring of lifestyle by detecting and analysing physiological signals. Heart rate variability (HRV) denotes the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.The HRV signal, as detected by the sensors and devices, has been popularly used as an indicative measure to estimate the level of stress, depression, and anxiety. For years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based learning systems have been known for their predictive capabilities, and in recent years, AI models with deep learning (DL) architectures have been successfully applied to achieve unprecedented accuracy. In order to determine effective methodologies applied to the collection, processing, and prediction of stress from HRV data, this work presents an in depth analysis of 43 studies reporting the application of various AI algorithms. The methods are summarised in tables and thoroughly evaluated to ensure the completeness of their findings and reported results. To make the work comprehensive, a detailed review has been conducted on sensing technologies, pre-processing methods applied on multi-modal data, and employed prediction models. This is followed by a critical examination of how various Machine Learning (ML) models, have been utilised in predicting stress from HRV data. In addition, the reported reseults from the selected studies have been carefully analysed to identify features that enable the models to perform better. Finally, the challenges of using HRV to predict stress are listed, along with some possible mitigation strategies. This work aims to highlight the impact of AI-based stress prediction methodologies from HRV data, and is expected to aid the development of more meticulous techniques.

AB Image segmentation accuracy is critical in marine ecological detection utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By flying a drone around, we can swiftly determine the location of a variety of species. However, remote sensing photos, particularly those of inter-class items, are remarkably similar, and there are a significant number of little objects. The universal segmentation network is ineffective. This research constructs attentional networks that imitate the human cognitive system, inspired by camouflaged object detection and the management of human attentional mechanisms in the recognition of diverse things. This research proposes TriseNet, an attention-guided multi-scale fusion semantic segmentation network that solves the challenges of high item similarity and poor segmentation accuracy in UAV settings. To begin, we employ a bidirectional feature extraction network to extract low-level spatial and high-level semantic information. Second, we leverage the attention-induced cross-level fusion module (ACFM) to create a new multi-scale fusion branch that performs cross-level learning and enhances the representation of inter-class comparable objects. Finally, the receptive field block (RFB) module is used to increase the receptive field, resulting in richer characteristics in specific layers. The inter-class similarity increases the difficulty of segmentation accuracy greatly, whereas the three modules improve feature expression and segmentation results. Experiments are conducted using our UAV dataset, UAV-OUC-SEG (55.61% MIoU), and the public dataset, Cityscapes (76.10% MIoU), to demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy. In two datasets, the TriseNet delivers the best results when compared to other prominent segmentation algorithms.

AB Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is one of the mainstream frameworks for brain-like computing and neuromorphic computing, which has the potential to overcome current AI challenges, for example, low-power learning dynamic processes. However, there is still a huge gap in performance between SNN and artificial neural networks (ANN) in traditional supervised learning. One solution for this problem is to propose a better spiking neuron model to improve its memory ability for temporal data. This paper proposed a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with dynamic postsynaptic potential and a layer-span connecting method for SNN trained using backpropagation. The dynamic postsynaptic potential LIF model allows the neurons dynamically release neurotransmitters in an SNN model, which mimics the activity of biological neurons. The layer-span connecting method enhances the long-distance memory ability of SNN. We also first introduced a cosh-based surrogate gradient for the backpropagation training of SNNs. We compared the SNN with cosh-based surrogate gradient (CSNN), CSNN with dynamic postsynaptic potential (Dyn-CSNN), layer-span connecting CSNN (Las-CSNN), and SNN model with all the proposed methods (DlaCSNN-BP) in three image classification and one text classification datasets. The experimental results exhibited that proposed SNN methods could outperform most of the previously proposed SNNs and ANNs in the same network structure. Among them, the proposed DlaCSNN-BP got the best classification performance. This result indicates that our proposed method can effectively improve the effect of SNN in supervised learning and reduce the gap with deep learning. This work also provides more possibilities for putting SNN into practical application.

AB Progressive mesh simplification (PM) algorithm aims to generate simplified mesh at any resolution for the input high-precision mesh, and only needs to be optimized or fitted once. Most of the existing PM algorithms are obtained based on heuristic mesh simplification algorithms, which leads to redundant storage space and poor practice-ability of the algorithm. In this article, a progressive mesh simplification algorithm based on neural implicit representation (NePM) is proposed, and NePM transforms algorithm process into an implicit continuous optimization problem through neural network and probabilistic model. NePM uses Gaussian mixture model to model high-precision mesh and samples the probabilistic model to obtain simplified meshes at different resolutions. In addition, the simplified mesh is optimized through multi-level neural network, preserving characteristics of the input high-precision mesh. Thus, the algorithm in this work lowers the memory usage of the PM and improves the practicability of the algorithm while ensuring the accuracy.

AB High product diversity, dynamic market conditions, and a lack of skilled workers are current challenges in manufacturing. Industrial robots autonomously planning and completing upcoming production tasks can help companies address these challenges. In this publication, we focus on autonomous task planning within industrial robotics and investigate how to facilitate the use of automated planning techniques from the field of artificial intelligence for this purpose. First, we present a novel methodology to automatically adapt abstractly modeled planning domains to the characteristics of individual application cases a user intends to implement. A planning domain is a formalized representation of the robot's working environment that builds the basis for automated planning. Second, we integrate this approach into the procedure for developing skills-based industrial robotic applications to enable them to perform autonomous task planning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the methodology within the application field kitting in two reference scenarios with a mobile robot and a stationary robot cell. Using our methodology, persons without expertise in automated planning can enable a robot for autonomous task planning without much extra effort.

AB Automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling has become a hot topic in recent years as manufacturing systems become flexible and intelligent. However, little research regards dynamic AGV scheduling considering energy consumption, particularly battery replacement. This paper proposes a novel method that employs deep reinforcement learning to address the dynamic scheduling of energy-efficient AGVs with battery replacement in production logistics systems. The bi-objective joint optimization problem of AGV scheduling and battery replacement management is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, which supports data-driven decision-making. Then, this paper constructs a deep reinforcement learning-based optimization architecture and develops a novel dueling deep double Q network algorithm to maximize the long-term rewards for optimizing material handling's tardiness and energy consumption. Numerical experiments and a case study demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and cleaner than state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method can significantly improve customer satisfaction and reduce production costs within flexible manufacturing processes, particularly in Industry 4.0.

AB With the advances in Internet-of-Things and data mining technologies, deep learning-based approaches have been widely used for intelligent fault diagnosis of manufacturing assets. However, uncertainty caused by the non-stationary process data such as vibration signal and noise interference in practical working environments will greatly affect the performance and reliability of predictions. The present paper develops a trustworthy and intelligent fault diagnosis framework based on a two-stage joint denoising method and evidential neural networks. The proposed denoising method integrating the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and the independent component analysis (ICA) method can effectively reduce data uncertainty caused by noise interference. The stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model has been incorporated into the evidential neural networks as a deep classifier. The proposed evidential SGRU (ESGRU) method can quantify the prediction uncertainty, which estimates the prediction trustworthiness. Predictive entropy and reliability diagrams are used as calibration methods to validate the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. The proposed framework is validated by two case studies of rolling bearing fault diagnosis in variable noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high denoising effect and provide reliable uncertainty prediction results which are significant for practical applications.

ID IMAGES; NOISE
AB Fine-grained image classification aims to recognize fine-grained objects, e.g., different bird species or plane types. However, most proposed methods rely on large-scale annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, a branch of works propose to learn subtle feature embeddings from webly-annotated images, known as webly-supervised fine-grained recognition. Unfortunately, labels from web are often filled with a large number of noise, which severely hampers the learning of robust neural networks. The most common method at present is to discard high-loss noise samples and select small-loss instances for supervised training, but this selection method still contains a fraction of mislabelled hard samples, which seriously affects the final classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Co-Training-based Label Correction method (CTLC) to identify noisy samples for robust network learning. Specifically, we train two networks simultaneously to divide images into clean data, in-distribution noisy data, and out-of-distribution data. We regard one's prediction as the other's pseudo label for the next step's training. The out-of-distribution data are discarded and the in-distribution data are relabeled for training. To assure the reliability of re-labeling, a history-assistant in-distribution noise relabeling method is proposed, where cumulative prediction is used to update the labels of the in-distribution noise samples. Extensive experiments on three commonly used noisy fine-grained datasets (i.e., CUB200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and Cars-196) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB Underserved communities face critical health challenges due to lack of access to timely and reliable information. Nongovernmental organizations are leveraging the widespread use of cellphones to combat these healthcare challenges and spread preventative awareness. The health workers at these organizations reach out individually to beneficiaries; however, such programs still suffer from declining engagement. We have deployed Saheli, a system to efficiently utilize the limited availability of health workers for improving maternal and child health in India. Saheli uses the Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) framework to identify beneficiaries for outreach. It is the first deployed application for RMABs in public health, and is already in continuous use by our partner NGO, ARMMAN. We have already reached similar to 130K beneficiaries with Saheli, and are on track to serve one million beneficiaries by the end of 2023. This scale and impact has been achieved through multiple innovations in the RMAB model and its development, in preparation of real world data, and in deployment practices; and through careful consideration of responsible AI practices. Specifically, in this paper, we describe our approach to learn from past data to improve the performance of Saheli's RMAB model, the real-world challenges faced during deployment and adoption of Saheli, and the end-to-end pipeline.

AB Reasonable and effective task allocation strategy is the premise to ensure the successful completion of combat missions, which is of great significance to improve the overall operational effectiveness of the cluster. In this paper, a cooperative task allocation method for multi heterogeneous aerial vehicles under strong space-time constraints using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and entropy weight method is presented. Spe-cifically, the problem of cooperative task allocation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem under multi-constraint conditions, and the requirement of required time of arrival (RTA) of time-sensitive targets is considered. Then, the PSO algorithm is applied to solve the task allocation model. Especially, task sequence is introduced into the coding of the feasible solutions, and task urgency is employed to update the particle position. Furthermore, the entropy weight method is introduced into task assignment scheme decision-making. Finally, a simulation is given to illustrate the validity.

AB In light of advancing socio-economic development and urban infrastructure, urban traffic congestion and accidents have become pressing issues. High-resolution remote sensing images are crucial for supporting urban geographic information systems (GIS), road planning, and vehicle navigation. Additionally, the emergence of robotics presents new possibilities for traffic management and road safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines attention mechanisms and robotic multimodal information fusion for retrieving traffic scenes from remote sensing images. Attention mechanisms focus on specific road and traffic features, reducing computation and enhancing detail capture. Graph neural algorithms improve scene retrieval accuracy. To achieve efficient traffic scene retrieval, a robot equipped with advanced sensing technology autonomously navigates urban environments, capturing high-accuracy, wide-coverage images. This facilitates comprehensive traffic databases and real-time traffic information retrieval for precise traffic management. Extensive experiments on large-scale remote sensing datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. The integration of attention mechanisms, graph neural algorithms, and robotic multimodal information fusion enhances traffic scene retrieval, promising improved information extraction accuracy for more effective traffic management, road safety, and intelligent transportation systems. In conclusion, this interdisciplinary approach, combining attention mechanisms, graph neural algorithms, and robotic technology, represents significant progress in traffic scene retrieval from remote sensing images, with potential applications in traffic management, road safety, and urban planning.

AB This article is devoted to analyzing the multistability and robustness of competitive neural networks (NNs) with time-varying delays. Based on the geometrical structure of activation functions, some sufficient conditions are proposed to ascertain the coexistence of Pi(n)(i=1) (2R(i) + 1) equilibrium points, Pi(n)(i=1)(R-i + 1) of them are locally exponentially stable, where n represents a dimension of system and R-i is the parameter related to activation functions. The derived stability results not only involve exponential stability but also include power stability and logarithmical stability. In addition, the robustness of Pi(n)(i=1)(R-i+1) stable equilibrium points is discussed in the presence of perturbations. Compared with previous papers, the conclusions proposed in this article are easy to verify and enrich the existing stability theories of competitive NNs. Finally, numerical examples are provided to support theoretical results.

TI Learn and route: learning implicit preferences for vehicle routing

AB We investigate a learning decision support system for vehicle routing, where the routing engine learns implicit preferences that human planners have when manually creating route plans (or routings). The goal is to use these learned subjective preferences on top of the distance-based objective criterion in vehicle routing systems. This is an alternative to the practice of distinctively formulating a custom vehicle routing problem (VRP) for every company with its own routing requirements. Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions over similar sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The learning approach is based on the concept of learning a Markov model, which corresponds to a probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance matrix. This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in creating the actual routings, and to optimize over both distances and preferences at the same time. For the learning, we explore different schemes to construct the probabilistic transition matrix that can co-evolve with changing preferences over time. Our results on randomly generated instances and on a use-case with a small transportation company show that our method is able to generate results that are close to the manually created solutions, without needing to characterize all constraints and sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of changes in the customer sets, our approach is able to find solutions that are closer to the actual routings than when using only distances, and hence, solutions that require fewer manual changes when transformed into practical routings.

TI CSP beyond tractable constraint languages

AB The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is among themost studied computational problems. While NP-hard, many tractable subproblems have been identified (Bulatov 2017, Zhuk 2017) Backdoors, introduced by Williams, Gomes, and Selman (2003), gradually extend such a tractable class to all CSP instances of bounded distance to the class. Backdoor size provides a natural but rather crude distance measure between a CSP instance and a tractable class. Backdoor depth, introduced by Mahlmann, Siebertz, and Vigny (2021) for SAT, is a more refined distance measure, which admits the parallel utilization of different backdoor variables. Bounded backdoor size implies bounded backdoor depth, but there are instances of constant backdoor depth and arbitrarily large backdoor size. Dreier, Ordyniak, and Szeider (2022) provided fixed-parameter algorithms for finding backdoors of small depth into the classes of Horn and Krom formulas. In this paper, we consider backdoor depth for CSP. We consider backdoors w.r.t. tractable subproblems C-Gamma of the CSP defined by a constraint language Gamma, i.e., where all the constraints use relations from the language Gamma. Building upon Dreier et al.'s game-theoretic approach and their notion of separator obstructions, we show that for any finite, tractable, semi-conservative constraint language Gamma, the CSP is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the backdoor depth into C Gamma plus the domain size. With backdoors of low depth, we reach classes of instances that require backdoors of arbitrary large size. Hence, our results strictly generalize several known results for CSP that are based on backdoor size.

AB In recent years, deep-learning-based pixel-level unified image fusion methods have received more and more attention due to their practicality and robustness. However, they usually require a complex network to achieve more effective fusion, leading to high computational cost. To achieve more efficient and accurate image fusion, a lightweight pixel-level unified image fusion (L-PUIF) network is proposed. Specifically, the information refinement and measurement process are used to extract the gradient and intensity information and enhance the feature extraction capability of the network. In addition, these information are converted into weights to guide the loss function adaptively. Thus, more effective image fusion can be achieved while ensuring the lightweight of the network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four public image fusion datasets across multimodal fusion, multifocus fusion, and multiexposure fusion. Experimental results show that L-PUIF can achieve better fusion efficiency and has a greater visual effect compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the practicability of L-PUIF in high-level computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection and image segmentation, has been verified.

AB Multiview spectral clustering, renowned for its spatial learning capability, has garnered significant attention in the data mining field. However, existing methods assume that the optimal consensus adjacency matrix is confined within the space spanned by each view's adjacency matrix. This constraint restricts the feasible domain of the algorithm and hinders the exploration of the optimal consensus adjacency matrix. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and convex strategy, termed the consensus neighbor strategy, for learning the optimal consensus adjacency matrix. This approach constructs the optimal consensus adjacency matrix by capturing the consensus local structure of each sample across all views, thereby expanding the search space and facilitating the discovery of the optimal consensus adjacency matrix. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a correlation measuring matrix to prevent trivial solution. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, benefitting from the convex nature of our model, which ensures convergence to a global optimum. Experimental results on 16 multiview datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of its robust consensus representation learning capability.

AB This brief studies the distributed synchronization of time-delay coupled neural networks (NNs) with impulsive pinning control involving stabilizing delays. A novel differential inequality is proposed, where the state's past information at impulsive time is effectively extracted and used to handle the synchronization of coupled NNs. Based on this inequality, the restriction that the size of impulsive delay is always limited by the system delay is removed, and the upper bound on the impulsive delay is relaxed, which is improved the existing related results. By using the methods of average impulsive interval (AII) and impulsive delay, some relaxed criteria for distributed synchronization of time-delay coupled NNs are obtained. The proposed synchronization conditions do not impose on the upper bound of two consecutive impulsive signals, and the lower bound is more flexible. Moreover, our results reveal that the impulsive delays may contribute to the synchronization of time-delay systems. Finally, typical networks are presented to illustrate the advantage of our delayed impulsive control method.

AB Using computers to replace pilot seats in air traffic control (ATC) simulators is an effective way to improve controller training efficiency and reduce training costs. To achieve this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning model, RoBERTa-RL (RoBERTa with Reinforcement Learning), for generating pilot repetitions. RoBERTa-RL is based on the pre-trained language model RoBERTa and is optimized through transfer learning and reinforcement learning. Transfer learning is used to address the issue of scarce data in the ATC domain, while reinforcement learning algorithms are employed to optimize the RoBERTa model and overcome the limitations in model generalization caused by transfer learning. We selected a real-world area control dataset as the target task training and testing dataset, and a tower control dataset generated based on civil aviation radio land-air communication rules as the test dataset for evaluating model generalization. In terms of the ROUGE evaluation metrics, RoBERTa-RL achieved significant results on the area control dataset with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.9962, 0.992, and 0.996, respectively. On the tower control dataset, the scores were 0.982, 0.954, and 0.982, respectively. To overcome the limitations of ROUGE in this field, we conducted a detailed evaluation of the proposed model architecture using keyword-based evaluation criteria for the generated repetition instructions. This evaluation criterion calculates various keyword-based metrics based on the segmented results of the repetition instruction text. In the keyword-based evaluation criteria, the constructed model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.8% on the area control dataset and 81.8% on the tower control dataset. In terms of generalization, RoBERTa-RL improved accuracy by 56% compared to the model before improvement and achieved a 47.5% improvement compared to various comparative models. These results indicate that employing reinforcement learning strategies to enhance deep learning algorithms can effectively mitigate the issue of poor generalization in text generation tasks, and this approach holds promise for future application in other related domains.

AB In this article, we investigate the distributed tracking control problem for networked uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback systems with unknown time-varying gains under a directed interaction topology. A dual phase performance-guaranteed approach is established. In the first phase, a fully distributed robust filter is constructed for each agent to estimate the desired trajectory with prescribed performance such that the control directions of all agents are allowed to be nonidentical. In the second phase, by establishing a novel lemma regarding Nussbaum function, a new adaptive control protocol is developed for each agent based on backstepping technique, which not only steers the output to track the corresponding estimated signal asymptotically with arbitrarily prescribed transient response but also extends the application scope of the proposed control scheme largely since the unknown control gains are allowed to be time-varying and even state-dependent. In such a way, the underlying problem is tackled with the output tracking error converging into an arbitrarily preassigned residual set exhibiting an arbitrarily predefined convergence rate. Besides, all the internal signals are ensured to be semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded (SGUUB). Finally, two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the co-designed scheme.

AB Sliding mode control (SMC) of induction motor is a new concept in the current scenario, as it seeks to improve torque control accuracy and power steering efficiency through the use of pulse width modulation schemes. Furthermore, artificial neural network-based sliding mode control is applied to a squirrel cage induction motor, which is used in the steering control of automobiles. The artificial neural network (ANN)-based SMC is more popular due to its robustness and good stability in external parameter variation. Additionally, an SMC and an ANN-based SMC are employed to compute the torque and flux, improving performance for power steering applications. The performance of the designed model is validated through MATLAB/Simulink and experimental models with different controllers under various operating conditions. The controller has been embedded into a TMS320F28335 controller, and performances have been evaluated. The performance analyses of induction motor using different controllers are performed. The transient performances of induction motor such as delay time, rise time, settling time, and steady-state error are investigated. The proposed work is analysed by using a mathematical model and implemented in a test-bench model for validation.

TI A Factor Marginal Effect Analysis Approach and Its Application in
   E-Commerce Search System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID DECISION TREE
AB Feature explanation plays an increasingly essential role in the e-commerce search platform. Most of the existing studies focus on modeling the user's interests to estimate the click-through rate (CTR). A good e-commerce system not only needs precise ranking to inspire users' shopping desire but also needs feature explanation to meet the demands of shop owners. The e-commerce traffic health of merchants is very important. How to effectively achieve shop owners' multiple goals still remains as an open problem. In industrial search systems, merchants' key demands mainly include two aspects. On the one hand, merchants want to know rule analysis of online traffic distribution, so as to help them understand the logistics of online traffic. On the other hand, they need relevant online traffic participation tools, which instruct them to participate. To address these issues, we propose a factor marginal effect analysis approach (FMEA) based on game theory, which can compute the contribution of one-dimensional features to the enhancement of online traffic. First, we use machine learning to model the business target. Then, we improve the SHAP value algorithm, which can provide clear business insights. Finally, we calculate the marginal effect of each feature on the business outcome. In this way, we provide a traffic analysis guidance method and address merchants' participation challenges. In fact, the FMEA has been deployed in a real-world Large-Internet-Company's App search systems and successfully serves online e-commerce service to over hundreds of millions of consumers. Our approach can guide operational decisions effectively and bring +10.05% revenue for the flow index, +7.54% for the user feedback index, and +2.46% for the service index.

DE Camouflaged object detection (COD); salient object detection (SOD)
ID SALIENT OBJECTS
AB Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify object pixels visually embedded in the background environment. Existing deep learning methods fail to utilize the context information around different pixels adequately and efficiently. In order to solve this problem, a novel pixel-centric context perception network (PCPNet) is proposed, the core of which is to customize the personalized context of each pixel based on the automatic estimation of its surroundings. Specifically, PCPNet first employs an elegant encoder equipped with the designed vital component generation (VCG) module to obtain a set of compact features rich in low-level spatial and high-level semantic information across multiple subspaces. Then, we present a parameter-free pixel importance estimation (PIE) function based on multiwindow information fusion. Object pixels with complex backgrounds will be assigned with higher PIE values. Subsequently, PIE is utilized to regularize the optimization loss. In this way, the network can pay more attention to those pixels with higher PIE values in the decoding stage. Finally, a local continuity refinement module (LCRM) is used to refine the detection results. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmarks, five salient object detection (SOD) benchmarks, and five polyp segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PCPNet with respect to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB The article investigates the possibility of identifying the presence of SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) relations between concepts represented by terms on the base of their vector representation in general natural language models. Several language models of the Word2Vec and GloVe families are considered, on the basis of which an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier of SKOS relations is formed. To train and test the efficiency of the classifier, datasets formed on the basis of the DBPedia and EuroVoc thesauri are used. The experiments performed have shown the high efficiency of the classifier trained using GloVe family models, while training it with use of Word2Vec models looks impossible in the bounds of considered ANN-based classifier architecture. Based on the results, a conclusion is made about the key role of taking into account the global context of the use of terms in the text for the possibility of identifying SKOS relations.

   classification; receiver operating characteristics; weighted
   uncorrelated constraint
AB In real classification scenarios, the number distribution of modeling samples is usually out of proportion. Most of the existing classification methods still face challenges in comprehensive model performance for imbalanced data. In this article, a novel theoretical framework is proposed that establishes a proportion coefficient independent of the number distribution of modeling samples and a general merge loss calculation method independent of class distribution. The loss calculation method of the imbalanced problem focuses on both the global and batch sample levels. Specifically, the loss function calculation introduces the true-positive rate (TPR) and the false-positive rate (FPR) to ensure the independence and balance of loss calculation for each class. Based on this, global and local loss weight coefficients are generated from the entire dataset and batch dataset for the multiclass classification problem, and a merge weight loss function is calculated after unifying the weight coefficient scale. Furthermore, the designed loss function is applied to different neural network models and datasets. The method shows better performance on imbalanced datasets than state-of-the-art methods.

TI Gradient Correction for White-Box Adversarial Attacks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Adversarial examples; black-box attacks; deep neural networks (DNNs);
   gradient correction; white-box attacks
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) play key roles in various artificial intelligence applications such as image classification and object recognition. However, a growing number of studies have shown that there exist adversarial examples in DNNs, which are almost imperceptibly different from the original samples but can greatly change the output of DNNs. Recently, many white-box attack algorithms have been proposed, and most of the algorithms concentrate on how to make the best use of gradients per iteration to improve adversarial performance. In this article, we focus on the properties of the widely used activation function, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and find that there exist two phenomena (i.e., wrong blocking and over transmission) misguiding the calculation of gradients for ReLU during backpropagation. Both issues enlarge the difference between the predicted changes of the loss function from gradients and corresponding actual changes and misguide the optimized direction, which results in larger perturbations. Therefore, we propose a universal gradient correction adversarial example generation method, called ADV-ReLU, to enhance the performance of gradient-based white-box attack algorithms such as fast gradient signed method (FGSM), iterative FGSM (I-FGSM), momentum I-FGSM (MI-FGSM), and variance tuning MI-FGSM (VMI-FGSM). Through backpropagation, our approach calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network input, maps the values to scores, and selects a part of them to update the misguided gradients. Comprehensive experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR10 demonstrate that our ADV-ReLU can be easily integrated into many state-of-the-art gradient-based white-box attack algorithms, as well as transferred to black-box attacks, to further decrease perturbations measured in the l(2)-norm.

AB This article proposes two novel projection neural networks (PNNs) with fixed-time (FIXt ) convergence to deal with variational inequality problems (VIPs). The remarkable features of the proposed PNNs are FIXt convergence and more accurate upper bounds for arbitrary initial conditions. The robustness of the proposed PNNs under bounded noises is further studied. In addition, the proposed PNNs are applied to deal with absolute value equations (AVEs), noncooperative games, and sparse signal reconstruction problems (SSRPs). The upper bounds of the settling time for the proposed PNNs are tighter than the bounds in the existing neural networks. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PNNs are confirmed by numerical examples.

AB Morphological re-inflection generation is one of the most challenging tasks in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, especially with morphologically rich, low-resource languages like Arabic. In this research, we investigate the ability of transformer-based models in the singular-to-plural Arabic noun conversion task. We start with pretraining a Character-BERT model on a masked language modeling task using 1,134,950 Arabic words and then adopting the fusion technique to transfer the knowledge gained by the pretrained model to a full encoder-decoder transformer model, in one of the proposed settings. The second proposed setting directly fuses the output Character-BERT embeddings into the decoder. We then analyze and compare the performance of the two architectures and provide an interpretability section in which we track the features of attention with respect to the model. We perform the interpretation on both the macro and micro levels, providing some individual examples. Moreover, we provide a thorough error analysis showing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in the Arabic NLP domain that adopts the development of an end-to-end fused-transformer deep learning model to address the problem of singular-to-plural conversion.

TI Category-related attention domain adaptation for one-stage cross-domain
   object detection
SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE computer vision; object detection
AB Cross-domain object detection aims to generalize the distribution of features extracted by an object detector from an annotated domain to an unknown and unlabelled domain. Although one-stage cross-domain object detectors have significant advantages in deployment than two-stage ones, they suffer from two problems. First, neglect of category features and inaccurate alignment between multiple category features would lead to decreased domain adaptation efficiency. Second, one-stage detectors are more sensitive to imbalance of samples and negative samples severely affect the alignment process of domain adaptation. To overcome these two problems, an innovative category-related attention domain adaptive method that refines discrimination for each category's feature has been proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a group of domain discriminators is assigned to each category to refine the fine-grained features between categories. The discriminators are trained via an adversarial discriminant framework to align the fine-grained distributions cross different domains. A category attention alignment (CAA) module is proposed to navigate more attention to the foreground regions in instance-level, which effectively alleviates the negative migration problem caused by the positive and negative sample imbalance of the one-stage detector. Specifically, two sub-modules in the CAA module are developed: a local CAA module and a global CAA module. These modules aim to optimize the domain offsets in both the local and global dimensions. In addition, a progressive global alignment module is designed to align image-level features, offering prior knowledge of migration for the CAA module. The progressive global alignment module and CAA module collaboratively engage in benign competition with the backbone network across various levels. Extensive transferring experiments are conducted among cityscapes, foggy cityscapes, SIM10K, and KITTI. Experimental results show that the proposed method has much superior performance than other one-stage cross-domain detectors.
   In this paper, a category-related attention feature alignment framework is proposed to address the category misalignment problem in one-stage cross-domain object detection tasks. The proposed model saves on relabelling costs and improves generalization. It is of tremendous significance for engineering practice.image

AB Energy forecasting is crucial in scheduling and planning future electric load, so as to improve the reliability and safeness of the power grid. Despite recent developments of forecasting algorithms in the machine learning community, there is a lack of general and advanced algorithms specifically considering requirements from the power industry perspective. In this paper, we present eForecaster, a unified AI platform including robust, flexible, and explainable machine learning algorithms for diversified energy forecasting applications. Since October 2021, multiple commercial bus load, system load, and renewable energy forecasting systems built upon eForecaster have been deployed in seven provinces of China. The deployed systems consistently reduce the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 39.8% to 77.0%, with reduced manual work and explainable guidance. In particular, eForecaster also integrates multiple interpretation methods to uncover the working mechanism of the predictive models, which significantly improves forecasts adoption and user satisfaction.

AB Data hiding has become a hot research topic in recent years due to increased attention placed on the copyright protection of ocean images and related digital records. Further, high image volumes put enormous pressure on transmission bandwidth and storage capabilities. This paper proposes an innovative deep learning-based data-hiding technique for ocean images. First, a down-sampling scheme is applied to compress the secret mark before embedding it in the host media. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to embed and recover compressed marks into or from the host ocean image. Finally, a generative adversarial network-based reconstruction network is used to reconstruct the high-quality mark image. Our experiments show that the proposed work not only maintains high imperceptibility and robustness against many attacks but also provides better data-hiding performance than related works.

TI TRACL: Temporal reconstruction and adaptive consistency loss for

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article; Early Access
DE adaptive consistency loss; temporal reconstruction; video semantic
   segmentation
AB While existing supervised semantic segmentation methods have shown significant performance improvements, they heavily rely on large-scale pixel-level annotated data. To reduce this dependence, recent research has proposed semi-supervised learning-based methods that have achieved great success. However, almost all these works are mainly dedicated to image semantic segmentation, while semi-supervised video semantic segmentation (SVSS) has been barely explored. Due to the significant difference between video data and image, simply adapting semi-supervised image semantic segmentation approaches to SVSS may neglect the inherent temporal correlations in video frames. This paper presents a novel method (named TRACL) with temporal reconstruction (TR) and adaptive consistency loss (ACL) for SVSS, aiming to fully utilize the temporal relations of internal frames in video clip. The authors' TR method implements the reconstruction from the feature and output levels to narrow the distribution gap between internal video frames. Specifically, considering the underlying data distribution, the authors construct Gaussian models for each category, and use probability density function to obtain the similarity between different feature maps for temporal feature reconstruction. The authors' ACL can adaptively select two pixel-wise consistency loss including Flow Consistency Loss and Reconstruction Consistency Loss, providing stronger supervision signals for unlabelled frames during model training. Additionally, the authors extend their method to unlabelled video for more training data by employing mean-teacher structure. Extensive experiments on three datasets including Cityscapes, Camvid and VSPW demonstrate that the authors' proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, Protist algorithm (PA) and Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm (OOA) are applied to solve the power loss lessening problem. Protist Algorithm (PA) is modelled based on the Protist's natural activities. Protist exists in moist places. The leading nutritious phase is Plasmodium, the energetic and vibrant phase of Protist. In this segment, the organic substance in Protist search for food in surroundings and conceals enzymes for digestion. Natural actions of Otocyon megalotis are emulated to design the OOA approach. In the projected OOA searching of regions in exploration, for foodstuff the Otocyon megalotis mark the prey in the space is indicated as a global exploration. Real power loss reduction and Voltage stability enhancement are the key objectives of the paper. To solve the problem, Protist algorithm (PA) and Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm. In the course of the migration procedure, the anterior end outspreads and interconnected arterial system that authorize cytoplasm to stream inside. Then, mutation and cross-over probability are employed to augment the performance of the Protist algorithm (PA). With this integration engendering of the population is done. Mutation classes the population exploration agents (PN) in uphill order conferring to the agents appropriateness (fitness) cost. Consequently, the technique splits the organized agents into three fragments rendering to their fitness value. In which PN/3 denotes to the population possess pre-eminent (aptness) fitness values, subsequently with second pre-eminent and poorest aptness (fitness) values. Then, in this paper, Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm (OOA) is applied for solving the Power loss lessening problem. In the subsequent segment, navigate during the haunt to seal prey previous to the hit was replicated as a local search. In exploration, the data obtained is shared to all the associates of the family unit for continued existence and growth. Examination of the nearby terrain is modelled with reference to the fitness of all entities. Most excellent entity has investigated the majority fascinating terrain and it will be shared with family unit of Otocyon megalotis. Primarily, Otocyon megalotis show that it not involved in hunting. Conversely, as soon as moving near to prey Otocyon megalotis will perform the attack in quick mode. This approach imitated and designed in the local search segment. Authenticity of the Protist algorithm (PA) and Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm (OOA) is corroborated in 23 benchmark functions, IEEE 30, 57, 300 and 354 test systems. Power Loss reduction achieved with voltage stability enhancement. Real power loss reduction attained. Both the Protist algorithm (PA) and Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm (OOA) performed well in solving the Power loss reduction problem.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Compared with modification-based steganography, the coverless steganography models have stronger anti-detection performance. However, the limitations of low embedding capacity and image quality are existing in current coverless steganographic models. The image style transfer is a generation task that translates a style to another while maintaining the structure and semantics of the original image. The stable structures that can be used as cover to hide secret for steganography. In this paper, a generative steganographic model based on style transfer and feature-wise deep fusion is proposed, which can achieve a large embedding capacity and high generation quality. In embedding stage, the channel reduction net is designed to distill structural features from image, and the fusion net is proposed to fuse the secret matrix and distilled structural features. The embedded structural features are participated in style transfer to finish steganography. In secret recovery stage, the two-level extraction model is adopted. The structural features are extracted from stego image by residual network, then the embedded secret message is distilled from the extracted features. Compared with existing steganographic model, the proposed model is convenient applied without code-book or database, and the experimental results show that the model achieves a larger capacity, higher security and visual quality.

AB A true routing system for the Internet of Things (IoT), Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) offers protection against many types of routing threats. The attacker can exploit the routing structure of RPL for launching devastating and destructive attacks counter to an IoT network. Moreover, Sybil and Rank attacks are most familiar among IoT attacks. Additionally, the resource-constrained design of IoT devices results in a routing protocol for RPL that is susceptible to a number of assaults. Even though the RPL condition offers encryption protection for controlling messages, RPL is susceptible to selfish behaviors and also internal attackers. In this research, the Battle Competitive Swarm Optimisation (BCSO) algorithm is developed to address the absence of reliable security measures in RPL. This approach principally encompasses two segments, namely IoT simulation and RPL routing, whereas Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph is also applied in RPL. In this approach, different fitness functions, such as node energy, delay, trust, and distance are considered. The devised BCSO_RPL achieved better performance than other conventional techniques with energy consumption, throughput, delay, link quality, and packet loss of 0.7038 J, 0.2964Gbps, 0.6950 s, 2.178, and 0.0950, respectively.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction based on vision is a popular task in autopilot system. As pedestrian trajectories always cross each other, pedestrian targets will frequently obscure each other, which makes the collected pedestrian trajectories produce errors. Moreover, the interaction between pedestrians will have an impact on their trajectories in crowded areas, which leads to great challenge in trajectory prediction. In order to solve the above two problems, a pedestrian trajectory prediction method is proposed. Based on the YOLOv7 algorithm, it is connected with the StrongSORT algorithm. Then adding a feature recognition (ReID) module to the model, the problem of target switching and jumping in the process of pedestrian tracking can be solved. The dot product attention mechanism is also integrated into the long short term memory (LSTM) algorithm, the improved LSTM correlate target position and distance information for the pedestrian trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on three most challenging datasets showed that this method improves the performance and largely reduces the model size.
   This work proposed a deep learning-based method that incorporated YOLOv7, StrongSORT, and improved long short term memory (LSTM) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. YOLOv7 and StrongSORT algorithm are used to solve the problems of target switch and jump in target detection and tracking. By using the dot-product attention unit to improve the LSTM, the mutual effects of moving pedestrian orientation and distance to improve the prediction performance of overall system are fused. image

AB Deep reinforcement learning has always been used to solve high-dimensional complex sequential decision problems. However, one of the biggest challenges for reinforcement learning is sample efficiency, especially for high-dimensional complex problems. Model-based reinforcement learning can solve the problem with a learned world model, but the performance is limited by the imperfect world model, so it usually has worse approximate performance than model-free reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called World Model with Trajectory Discrimination (WMTD). We learn the representation of temporal dynamics information by adding a trajectory discriminator to the world model, and then compute the weight of state value estimation based on the trajectory discriminator to optimize the policy. Specifically, we augment the trajectories to generate negative samples and train a trajectory discriminator that shares the feature extractor with the world model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the sample efficiency and achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepMind control tasks.

   Self-attention mechanism; Long- and short-term interests; Item-item
   relations
AB A natural way of user modeling in sequential recommendation is to capture long-term and short-term preferences, respectively, given user historical behaviors and then fuse them together. Most existing approaches building on attention-based network focus only on exploring item-item relations within each user sequence and ignore collaborative relations among different user sequences, which restricts the improvement of recommendation quality, especially on sparse datasets. Moreover, construction and utilization of collaborative signals including the integration with the original information greatly impact the recommendation effects. In this paper, we propose a novel method named dynamic time-aware collaborative sequential recommendation with attention-based network(DTCoSR) to further address the issues. Specifically, we first design a time-aware collaborative item module to gain collaborative item representations for both long- and short-term interests, consisting of neighborhood selection and neighborhood information aggregation. Then, we utilize two independent self-attention networks to extract the two different levels of short-term interests dependent on the item representation and collaborative item representation, respectively, and then adaptively merge them as the final short-term interests. We achieve long-term interest via the correlation between the user embedding and its collaborative item embedding. Finally, DTCoSR fuses long- and short-term interests in an adaptive method. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that DTCoSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB PAC-Bayesian bounds are known to be tight and informative when studying the generalization ability of randomized classifiers. However, they require a loose and costly derandomization step when applied to some families of deterministic models such as neural networks. As an alternative to this step, we introduce new PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that have the originality to provide disintegrated bounds, i.e., they give guarantees over one single hypothesis instead of the usual averaged analysis. Our bounds are easily optimizable and can be used to design learning algorithms. We illustrate this behavior on neural networks, and we show a significant practical improvement over the state-of-the-art framework.

ID RISK; REPRESENTATION; GO
AB Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world applications since it aims to train policies directly from datasets of past interactions with the environment. The past few years, algorithms have been introduced to learn from high-dimensional observational states in offline settings. The general idea of these methods is to encode the environment into a latent space and train policies on top of this smaller representation. In this paper, we extend this general method to stochastic environments (i.e., where the reward function is stochastic) and consider a risk measure instead of the classical expected return. First, we show that, under some assumptions, it is equivalent to minimizing a risk measure in the latent space and in the natural space. Based on this result, we present Latent Offline Distributional Actor-Critic (LODAC), an algorithm which is able to train policies in high-dimensional stochastic and offline settings to minimize a given risk measure. Empirically, we show that using LODAC to minimize Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) outperforms previous methods in terms of CVaR and return on stochastic environments.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a machine learning technique with simple structure, fast learning speed, and excellent generalization ability, which has received a lot of attention since it was proposed. In order to further improve the sparsity of output weights and the robustness of the model, this paper proposes a sparse and robust ELM based on zero-norm regularization and a non-convex quadratic loss function. The zero-norm regularization obtains sparse hidden nodes automatically, and the introduced non-convex quadratic loss function enhances the robustness by setting constant penalties to outliers. The optimization problem can be formulated as the difference of convex functions (DC) programming. This DC programming is solved by using the DC algorithm (DCA) in this paper. The experiments on the artificial and Benchmark datasets verify that the proposed method has promising robustness while reducing the number of hidden nodes, especially on the datasets with higher outliers level.

However, traditional FD methods often need a great quantity of labeled data, and are prone to noise interference in practical work, resulting in a relatively low diagnosis accuracy. With the intention of overcoming these problems, this paper proposes a semi-supervised FD approach based on feature pre-extraction mechanism and improved generative adversarial network (IGAN). First, the data is preprocessed by the feature pre-extraction mechanism based on wavelet transform. Then, limited labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples are sent to the IGAN model. Finally, two typical gearbox fault datasets are utilized to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in limited labeled samples and noise environment. Trial results denote that the proposed approach has better diagnosis accuracy and anti-noise robustness than other approaches.

TI Propagation Structure Fusion for Rumor Detection Based on Node-Level

AB With the rise of social media, the rapid spread of rumors online has resulted in numerous negative effects on society and the economy. The methods for rumor detection have attracted great interest from both academia and industry. Given the widespread effectiveness of contrastive learning, many graph contrastive learning models for rumor detection have been proposed by using the event propagation structure as graph data. However, the existing contrastive models usually treat the propagation structure of other events similar to the anchor events as negative samples. While this design choice allows for discriminative learning, on the other hand, it also inevitably pushes apart semantically similar samples and, thus, degrades model performance. In this article, we propose a novel propagation fusion model called propagation structure fusion model based on node-level contrastive learning (PFNC) for rumor detection based on node-level contrastive learning. PFNC first obtains three augmented propagation structures by masking the text of each node in the propagation structure randomly and perturbing some edges in the propagation structure based on the importance of edges. Then, PFNC applies the node-level contrastive learning method between every two augmented propagation structures to prevent the samples with similar propagation structure from far away. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model is proposed to capture the relevant information that is consistent and supplementary among three augmented propagation structures by regarding the propagation structure of the event as a color picture, three augmented propagation structures as color channels, and each node as a pixel. The experimental results on real datasets show that the PFNC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models for rumor detection.

AB In modern block ciphers, the role of the substitution boxes is to generate ciphertext from the plaintext with high confusion. The immunity to various cryptographic attacks heavily depends on the strength of the S-box. In this article, a new method of obtaining highly nonlinear substitution boxes (S-boxes) is proposed. The subject method utilizes the artificial bee colony optimization technique. To check the immunity of the proposed S-boxes, the analysis of the proposed S-boxes is checked against the key performance indicators (KPIs) for S-boxes. The results obtained from KPIs are highly encouraging and the proposed S-boxes meet all the criteria needed for secure communication and storage of digital content. To rank the proposed S-box and the recently published S-boxes, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is discussed for the first time for the S-boxes.

AB This study aims to introduce a novel Non-Linear Diophantine Fuzzy Multi-Criterion Decision-Making Model for COVID-19 diagnosis and control. The study is organized into three sections to encourage individuals and to develop an appropriate strategy for emergency decision-making circumstances. First, we propose a generalizations of Pythagorean fuzzy sets, q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, and linear Diophantine fuzzy set, called Non-linear Diophantine fuzzy set (Non-LDFS) and discussed their important properties. Moreover, mathematical criteria for Non-LDFSs are established based on certain operating laws. In the second part of the study, we propose a set of Non-LDF averaging and geometric aggregation operators for aggregating expert judgments based on TOPSIS techniques. In final part, the newly defined Non-LDF Topsis Method is used to solve a medical diagnosis challenge for the COVID-19 virus, and the findings are reported. Using a set of five separate criteria, our newly implemented multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique can assess and select the best alternative solution for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.) A comparative analysis is also performed for the novel Non-LDF Topsis, and the prospects of the designed research are addressed.

AB Nowadays, several fuzzy extensions of the elimination and selection transforming reality (ELECTRE) and The Order Preference by Similarity to Positive Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods are emerging as powerful mathematical tools for addressing uncertainties in various multi-criteria decision-making situations within the medicine and engineering domains. Moreover, cubic bipolar fuzzy (CBF) set theory has proven to be an effective mathematical tool in addressing such problems. In this study, we propose an improved CBF-TOPSIS method that utilizes the concepts of normalized Euclidean distance and revised closeness index. This improvement is motivated by the limitations of the existing CBF-TOPSIS method, which relies on the notions of Euclidean distance and relative closeness index to reach the final decision. We also investigate the shortcomings of the existing CBF-ELECTRE-I method, specifically related to the discordance formula. To modify the algorithm based on the CBF-ELECTRE-I model, we introduce a new step that determines the exact linear ranking order of alternatives. This step is solely based on concordance and discordance outranking coefficients, ensuring a more precise evaluation of the alternatives. Additionally, we explore two new applications to validate the applicability and feasibility of the improved methods in the field of medicine (diagnosis cardiac disease) and engineering (selection of optimal urban plan). By conducting these application studies, we demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the improved methods in real-world decision-making scenarios. To further validate the modified CBF-ELECTRE-I and CBF-TOPSIS methods, we conduct a brief sensitivity analysis by comparing them to themselves as well as existing models, including bipolar fuzzy TOPSIS and ELECTRE-I.

AB A maximum cut (Max-Cut) problem in graph theory is NP-hard. This paper proposes a new randomized algorithm for finding local Max-Cut in graphs by using fuzzy logic. This paper proves that: (1) the computational complexity of computing local Max-Cut in graphs is in the class of randomized polynomial time (RP); (2) the real number solution of the new algorithm satisfies epsilon - delta condition; (3) local Max-Cut solutions are maintained after defuzzification that converts real number vectors to integer vectors. Numerical experiments show that the new algorithm outperforms IBM CPLEX solvers. The new algorithm is nine times faster than the CPLEX Convex solver and more than thirty times faster than the CPLEX Global solver. The new algorithm could find local Max-Cut in signed graphs whereas CPLEX Convex solver failed to find Max-Cut in signed graphs when Laplacian matrix was not positive semidefinite.

AB Ovarian cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. Correct differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors is of immense importance in medical fields. In this paper, we introduce group penalized logistic regressions to enhance diagnosis accuracy. Firstly, we divide 349 ovarian cancer patients into two sets: one for learning model parameters, and the other for assessing prediction performance, and select 46 variables from 49 traits as the predictor vector to construct GLASSO/GSCAD/GMCP penalized logistic regressions with 11 groups. Secondly, we develop group coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm and its specific pseudo code to simultaneously complete group selection and group estimation, introduce the tenfold cross validation (CV) procedure to select the relatively optimal tuning parameter, and apply the testing set and Youden index to obtain class probability estimator and class index information. Finally, we compute the accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score and the area under ROC curve (AUC) to assess the prediction performance to the proposed group penalized methods, and found that GLASSO/GSCAD/GMCP penalized logistic regressions outperform three machine learning methods (ANN, artificial neural network; SVM, support vector machine; XGBoost, eXtreme gradient boosting) and three deep learning methods (CNN, convolutional neural network; DNN, deep neural network; RNN, recurrent neural network) in terms of accuracy, F1-score and AUC.

ID 2-PHASE APPROACH
AB This research article presents a novel two-step generalized parametric approach to address various fuzzy parameter-based multi-objective transportation problems. These problems involve uncertain or imprecise data, making it challenging to find precise solutions. This research article aims to find multiple optimal solutions for various values of the parameter mu is an element of[0, 1], ultimately giving decision-makers a range of options from which the final solution is to choose. The suggested methodology consists of two main steps. In the first step, the fuzzy data is partitioned into distinct split levels using parametric equations controlled by the precision parameter mu, thereby transforming the FMOTPs intoCMOTPs. In the second step, fuzzy programming techniques are employed to solve the CMOTPs for varying values of mu, generating multiple optimal solutions. The gray relational analysis (GRA) technique is utilized within each split level to identify the best optimal compromise solution for that specific level. Furthermore, the preferred compromise solution is selected based on its minimal Euclidean distance to the ideal solution across all split levels, offering additional insights for decision-making. The proposed method is illustrated on three numerical problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing a range of trade-offs between conflicting objectives. A comparative analysis with existing methods in the literature highlights the advantages of the proposed approach, showcasing its practical usefulness in real-world transportation decision-making processes.

AB The solid transportation problem (STP) is a three-dimensional optimization problem concerned with minimizing total costs while meeting supply and demand limitations by utilizing a variety of transportation modes, referred to as conveyances. This study examines the application of the STP to a logistic problem related to the milk distribution problem. Here, the goal is to efficiently deliver milk from a production facility to multiple retail outlets, considering both the cost of transportation and time of delivery as the two primary objectives of the solid transportation problem. Hence, the bi-objective solid transportation problem (BOSTP) is solved, supposing its constraints are fuzzy due to various unpredictable factors during the transportation period. These uncertain values are initially de-fuzzified into the equivalent crisp values using the alpha-cut approach. Later, the STP is solved with single objectives at once using Vogel's approximation method. This mathematical model is then formulated to optimize the total transportation cost and time and solved using the hierarchical order goal programming technique to determine the most cost-effective and time-efficient route. The results show that the hierarchical order goal programming technique minimizes the total transportation cost and time while improving the effectiveness of milk distribution.

AB Social entrepreneurs play an essential role in innovative solutions to address the world's most challenging societal problems. Although the value of innovative ideas is undeniable during the new venture creation process, not all creative ideas can be implemented. Many barriers hinder nascent social entrepreneurs from realizing their new ideas. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to provide a holistic list of barriers that hinder social venture creation; and (2) to determine the solutions to overcome the detected barriers. This study employs an integrated methodology to identify barriers and solutions. First, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine the barriers. Following this, essential barriers were identified with the fuzzy Delphi (F-Delphi) method. Next, the weight of each barrier was calculated using the improved fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (IMF-SWARA). Then, fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (F-WASPAS) was used to rank solutions to overcome these barriers. The findings may help organizations advise nascent social entrepreneurs about potential obstacles, which may help reduce the number of entrepreneurs abandoning their ideas. Furthermore, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the results.

AB Fabric defect detection has been an important but challenging problem. One crucial problem lies in that the fabric colors and textures highly affect the detection performance. Especially, defects with low contrast to the fabric patterns are difficult to detect. We find that the color space is one important issue, and defects exhibit diverse discriminative levels given different color spaces. This observation inspired us to seek for an optimal color space for the defect detection problem. We propose a Color Conversion Network (CCN), which learns to project RGB colors into an optimized color space, where the fabric textures and the defective regions are the most distinguishable, to improve the defect detection performance. By introducing a contrastive loss, CCN can maximize the distance between defects and normal patterns effectively. The proposed CCN can be adopted as an add-in module that flexibly integrates with existing approaches to achieve universal improvement. Experiments demonstrate that the CCN module increases the fabric defect detection performance significantly with four state-of-the-art fabric defect detection approaches.

AB This article revisits the problems of impulsive stabilization and impulsive synchronization of discrete-time delayed neural networks (DDNNs) in the presence of disturbance in the input channel. A new Lyapunov approach based on double Lyapunov functionals is introduced for analyzing exponential input-to-state stability (EISS) of discrete impulsive delayed systems. In the framework of double Lyapunov functionals, a pair of timer-dependent Lyapunov functionals are constructed for impulsive DDNNs. The pair of Lyapunov functionals can introduce more degrees of freedom that not only can be exploited to reduce the conservatism of the previous methods, but also make it possible to design variable gain impulsive controllers. New design criteria for impulsive stabilization and impulsive synchronization are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical results show that compared with the constant gain design technique, the proposed variable gain design technique can accept larger impulse intervals and equip the impulsive controllers with a stronger disturbance attenuation ability. Applications to digital signal encryption and image encryption are provided which validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Significant efforts have been made in the past decade to humanize both the form and function of social robots to increase their acceptance among humans. To this end, social robots have recently been combined with brain-computer interface (BCI) systems in an attempt to give them an understanding of human mental states, particularly emotions. However, emotion recognition using BCIs poses several challenges, such as subjectivity of emotions, contextual dependency, and a lack of reliable neuro-metrics for real-time processing of emotions. Furthermore, the use of BCI systems introduces its own set of limitations, such as the bias-variance trade-off, dimensionality, and noise in the input data space. In this study, we sought to address some of these challenges by detecting human emotional states from EEG brain activity during human-robot interaction (HRI). EEG signals were collected from 10 participants who interacted with a Pepper robot that demonstrated either a positive or negative personality. Using emotion valence and arousal measures derived from frontal brain asymmetry (FBA), several machine learning models were trained to classify human's mental states in response to the robot personality. To improve classification accuracy, all proposed classifiers were subjected to a Global Optimization Model (GOM) based on feature selection and hyperparameter optimization techniques. The results showed that it is possible to classify a user's emotional responses to the robot's behavior from the EEG signals with an accuracy of up to 92%. The outcome of the current study contributes to the first level of the Theory of Mind (ToM) in Human-Robot Interaction, enabling robots to comprehend users' emotional responses and attribute mental states to them. Our work advances the field of social and assistive robotics by paving the way for the development of more empathetic and responsive HRI in the future.

AB BackgroundAir pollution contributes to the most severe environmental and health problems due to industrial emissions and atmosphere contamination, produced by climate and traffic factors, fossil fuel combustion, and industrial characteristics. Because this is a global issue, several nations have established control of air pollution stations in various cities to monitor pollutants like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10), to notify inhabitants when pollution levels surpass the quality threshold. With the rise in air pollution, it is necessary to construct models to capture data on air pollutant concentrations. Compared to other parts of the world, Africa has a scarcity of reliable air quality sensors for monitoring and predicting Particulate Matter (PM2.5). This demonstrates the possibility of extending research in air pollution control.MethodsMachine learning techniques were utilized in this study to identify air pollution in terms of time, cost, and efficiency so that different scenarios and systems may select the optimal way for their needs. To assess and forecast the behavior of Particulate Matter (PM2.5), this study presented a Machine Learning approach that includes Cat Boost Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree.ResultsCat Boost Regressor and Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor were implemented to predict the latest PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities with recording stations using past dated recordings, then the best performing model between the two is used to predict PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities with no recording stations and also to predict future PM2.5 concentrations for South African Cities. K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier were implemented to create a system predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) Status.ConclusionThis study investigated various machine learning techniques for air pollution to analyze and predict air pollution behavior regarding air quality and air pollutants, detecting which areas are most affected in South African cities.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB In this article, the adaptive neural control is studied for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with asymmetric input saturation, dead zone, and full state-function constraints. A suitable transformation is introduced to overcome the dead zone and saturation nonlinearity, and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. What is more, we apply the Nussbaum function and time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to deal with the unknown control gains and full state-function constraints, respectively. Based on the backstepping method, a universal adaptive neural control scheme is presented such that not only the state-function constraints of the closed-loop system cannot be violated and all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded, but also the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood containing the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by an application to the mass-spring-damper system and a numerical example.

AB IntroductionLumbar puncture is an important medical procedure for various diagnostics and therapies, but it can be hazardous due to individual variances in subcutaneous soft tissue, especially in the elderly and obese. Our research describes a novel robot-assisted puncture system that automatically controls and maintains the probe at the target tissue layer through a process of tissue recognition.MethodsThe system comprises a robotic system and a master computer. The robotic system is constructed based on a probe consisting of a pair of concentric electrodes. From the probe, impedance spectroscopy measures bio-impedance signals and transforms them into spectra that are communicated to the master computer. The master computer uses a Bayesian neural network to classify the bio-impedance spectra as corresponding to different soft tissues. By feeding the bio-impedance spectra of unknown tissues into the Bayesian neural network, we can determine their categories. Based on the recognition results, the master computer controls the motion of the robotic system.ResultsThe proposed system is demonstrated on a realistic phantom made of ex vivo tissues to simulate the spinal environment. The findings indicate that the technology has the potential to increase the precision and security of lumbar punctures and associated procedures.DiscussionIn addition to lumbar puncture, the robotic system is suitable for related puncture operations such as discography, radiofrequency ablation, facet joint injection, and epidural steroid injection, as long as the required tissue recognition features are available. These operations can only be carried out once the puncture needle and additional instruments reach the target tissue layer, despite their ensuing processes being distinct.

AB Demonstration Environments (DEs) are essential tools for testing and demonstrating new technologies, products, and services, and reducing uncertainties and risks in the innovation process. However, the terminology used to describe these environments is inconsistent, leading to heterogeneity in defining and characterizing them. This makes it difficult to establish a universal understanding of DEs and to differentiate between the different types of DEs, including testbeds, pilot-plants, and living labs. Moreover, existing literature lacks a holistic view of DEs, with studies focusing on specific types of DEs and not offering an integrated perspective on their characteristics and applicability in different contexts. This study proposes an ontology for knowledge representation related to DEs to address this gap. Using an ontology learning approach analyzing 3621 peer-reviewed journal articles, we develop a standardized framework for defining and characterizing DEs, providing a holistic view of these environments. The resulting ontology allows innovation managers and practitioners to select appropriate DEs for achieving their innovation goals, based on the characteristics and capabilities of the specific type of DE. The contributions of this study are significant in advancing the understanding and application of DEs in innovation processes. The proposed ontology provides a standardized approach for defining and characterizing DEs, reducing inconsistencies in terminology and establishing a common understanding of these environments. This enables innovation managers and practitioners to select appropriate DEs for their specific innovation goals, facilitating more efficient and effective innovation processes. Overall, this study provides a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the effective use of DEs in innovation.

AB Catastrophic forgetting remains an outstanding challenge in continual learning. Recently, methods inspired by the brain, such as continual representation learning and memory replay, have been used to combat catastrophic forgetting. Associative learning (retaining associations between inputs and outputs, even after good representations are learned) plays an important function in the brain; however, its role in continual learning has not been carefully studied. Here, we identified a two-layer neural circuit in the fruit fly olfactory system that performs continual associative learning between odors and their associated valences. In the first layer, inputs (odors) are encoded using sparse, high-dimensional representations, which reduces memory interference by activating nonoverlapping populations of neurons for different odors. In the second layer, only the synapses between odor-activated neurons and the odor's associated output neuron are modified during learning; the rest of the weights are frozen to prevent unrelated memories from being overwritten. We prove theoretically that these two perceptron-like layers help reduce catastrophic forgetting compared to the original perceptron algorithm, under continual learning. We then show empirically on benchmark data sets that this simple and lightweight architecture outperforms other popular neural-inspired algorithms when also using a two-layer feedforward architecture. Overall, fruit flies evolved an efficient continual associative learning algorithm, and circuit mechanisms from neuroscience can be translated to improve machine computation.

AB Neural activity in the brain exhibits correlated fluctuations that may strongly influence the properties of neural population coding. However, how such correlated neural fluctuations may arise from the intrinsic neural circuit dynamics and subsequently affect the computational properties of neural population activity remains poorly understood. The main difficulty lies in resolving the nonlinear coupling between correlated fluctuations with the overall dynamics of the system. In this study, we investigate the emergence of synergistic neural population codes from the intrinsic dynamics of correlated neural fluctuations in a neural circuit model capturing realistic nonlinear noise coupling of spiking neurons. We show that a rich repertoire of spatial correlation patterns naturally emerges in a bump attractor network and further reveals the dynamical regime under which the interplay between differential and noise correlations leads to synergistic codes. Moreover, we find that negative correlations may induce stable bound states between two bumps, a phenomenon previously unobserved in firing rate models. These noise-induced effects of bump attractors lead to a number of computational advantages including enhanced working memory capacity and efficient spatiotemporal multiplexing and can account for a range of cognitive and behavioral phenomena related to working memory. This study offers a dynamical approach to investigating realistic correlated neural fluctuations and insights to their roles in cortical computations.

TI Winning the Lottery With Neural Connectivity Constraints: Faster
   Learning Across Cognitive Tasks With Spatially Constrained Sparse RNNs
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used to model circuits in the brain and can solve a variety of difficult computational problems requiring memory, error correction, or selection (Hopfield, 1982; Maass et al., 2002; Maass, 2011). However, fully connected RNNs contrast structurally with their biological counterparts, which are extremely sparse (about 0.1%). Motivated by the neocortex, where neural connectivity is constrained by physical distance along cortical sheets and other synaptic wiring costs, we introduce locality masked RNNs (LM-RNNs) that use task-agnostic predetermined graphs with sparsity as low as 4%. We study LM-RNNs in a multitask learning setting relevant to cognitive systems neuroscience with a commonly used set of tasks, 20-Cog-tasks (Yang et al., 2019). We show through reductio ad absurdum that 20-Cog-tasks can be solved by a small pool of separated autapses that we can mechanistically analyze and understand. Thus, these tasks fall short of the goal of inducing complex recurrent dynamics and modular structure in RNNs. We next contribute a new cognitive multitask battery, Mod-Cog, consisting of up to 132 tasks that expands by about seven-fold the number of tasks and task complexity of 20-Cog-tasks. Importantly, while autapses can solve the simple 20-Cog-tasks, the expanded task set requires richer neural architectures and continuous attractor dynamics. On these tasks, we show that LM-RNNs with an optimal sparsity result in faster training and better data efficiency than fully connected networks.

TI Optimal Feedback Control for the Proportion of Energy Cost in the
   Upper-Arm Reaching Movement
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPEDANCE; MODEL
AB The minimum expected energy cost model, which has been proposed as one of the optimization principles for movement planning, can reproduce many characteristics of the human upper-arm reaching movement when signal-dependent noise and the co-contraction of the antagonist's muscles are considered. Regarding the optimization principles, discussion has been mainly based on feedforward control; however, there is debate as to whether the central nervous system uses a feedforward or feedback control process. Previous studies have shown that feedback control based on the modified linear-quadratic gaussian (LQG) control, including multiplicative noise, can reproduce many characteristics of the reaching movement. Although the cost of the LQG control consists of state and energy costs, the relationship between the energy cost and the characteristics of the reaching movement in the LQG control has not been studied. In this work, I investigated how the optimal movement based on the LQG control varied with the proportion of energy cost, assuming that the central nervous system used feedback control. When the cost contained specific proportions of energy cost, the optimal movement reproduced the characteristics of the reaching movement. This result shows that energy cost is essential in both feedforward and feedback control for reproducing the characteristics of the upper-arm reaching movement.

   neural network; Quantitative evaluation
AB Translational equivariance, one of the properties of Convolutional neural networks(CNNs), directly reflects the coherence of the influence of input at each position on the output. By looking for changes in variability such as translational equivariance, it is possible to determine whether the direction of model fit is correct. A controllable location target is designed to verify the translationlal equivariance of a CNN and then the effect of the CNN's parameters on positioning errors was investigated. Furthermore, A quantitative method called response index(ResIndex) is proposed in this paper. When the parameters of a CNN are determined, the distribution of the input signal response at each position in the heatmap can be obtained via simple algebraic calculations. Here we demonstrate that translational equivariance is primarily affected by the convolution boundary effect,which can be quantitatively assessed by the ResIndex. Experimental evidence for the Pearson correlation coefficient between the MSE and ResIndex demonstrates that our ResIndex is strongly negatively correlated with the MSE, with the mean Pearson correlation coefficient is -0.9282 on the CIFAR-10 and -0.7837 on COCO. For the first time, a unified quantitative evaluation index called the ResIndex is proposed to measure the translational equivariance of CNN. A complete mathematical derivation and a time-saving calculation method are given.

AB Non-convex optimization, which can better capture the problem structure, has received considerable attention in the applications of machine learning, image/signal processing, statistics, etc. With faster convergence rate, there have been tremendous studies on developing stochastic variance reduced algorithms to solve these non-convex optimization problems. However, as a crucial hyper-parameter for stochastic variance reduced algorithms, that how to select an appropriate step size is less researched in solving non-convex optimization problems. To address this gap, we propose a new class of stochastic variance reduced algorithms based on hyper-gradient, which has the ability to automatically obtain the online step size. Specifically, we focus on the variance-reduced stochastic optimization algorithms, the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm, which computes a full gradient periodically. We analyze theoretically the convergence of the proposed algorithm for non-convex optimization problems. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm enjoys the same complexities as state-of-the-art algorithms for solving non-convex problems in terms of finding an approximate stationary point. Thorough numerical results on empirical risk minimization with non-convex loss functions validate the efficacy of our method.

AB In modern times, the software industry is more focused on the timely release of high-quality software. Software bugs have a significant impact on software quality and reliability. To complete the bug triaging process on time, the triager has to understand each bug and assign the correct priority to it. However, the bugs are reported rapidly, with lots of uncertainty and irregularities in the bug tracking system. Furthermore, there are multiple priority labels that are semantically close to each other. As a result, the triager is confused while understanding and prioritizing the bugs. To address these problems, the research presents an intuitionistic fuzzy representation of topic features-based software bug priority prediction (IFTBPP) technique. Initially, the imbalanced priority classes of software bugs are balanced using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Then, topic modeling is used to create topics and terms for software bugs. The intuitionistic fuzzy set is used on the topics to compute various grades of a bug belonging to multiple priority classes. Finally, the similarity of a newly reported bug is calculated using intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures with multiple priority classes. All the experiments of IFTBPP are conducted on Eclipse, Mozilla, Apache, and NetBeans repositories and compared with other existing models. The accuracy values obtained by IFTBPP on these repositories are 92.5%, 91.9%, 89.2%, and 93.9%, whereas the corresponding F-measure values are 91.7%, 91.3%, 88.9%, and 93.1%.

AB Microaneurysms, tiny, circular red dots that occur in retinal fundus images, are one of the earliest symptoms of diabetic retinopathy. Because microaneurysms are small and delicate, detecting them can be difficult. Their small size and cunning character make automatic detection of them difficult. The automatic detection of microaneurysms in retinal fundus images is proposed in this research using a local Fourier transform and neighbourhood analysis-based multi-scale approach technique. The suggested method is broken down into three stages: image preprocessing, the detection of retinal vessels and microaneurysm candidates, and labelling of the candidates. A multi-scale framework is used to develop every stage of the algorithm, with the exception of the initial image preprocessing, giving the mechanism for efficient microaneurysms detection. In contrast to the short-time Fourier transform, which extracts the neighbourhood of each pixel and calculates each local Fourier transform separately, the local Fourier transform is employed in this study to extract the MA. After that, neighbourhood analysis is performed to name the microaneurysm because the item is actually a collection of independent little images rather than the entire image. Three separate data sets and different types of performance indicators are used to examine the robustness of the proposed model. Through the prominent performance, the proposed model is able to outperform other existing models. The classification accuracy of the proposed method for MESSIDOR and ORIGA data set is 99.28% and 98.95%, respectively.

TI Bel: Batch Equalization Loss for scene graph generation

AB Since scene graph can be used as the basis of many high-level vision semantic tasks, scene graph generation has attracted more and more attention of researchers, but most works are limited by the long-tail distribution of dataset, tend to predict those frequent but uninformative predicates such as "on" and "of." From a novel perspective, we found that in the training process, the model would promote the categories included in the batch, while suppressing the categories not in the batch. The long-tailed distribution of the data leads to the continuous suppression of tail categories, thus results in the model bias. In order to solve the problem above, we propose a novel simple and effective method named Batch Equalization Loss, which can be applied to most of the existing models and can bring effective improvement with only a few changes. It is worth noting that our method can achieve a more significant improvement on small batches than on big batches. Extensive experiments on the VG150 dataset show that our work can bring significant improvement on the basis of existing works. Code will be available at GitHub in the near future.

ID AGREEMENT
AB Recent studies show that the use of multimodality can effectively enhance the understanding of social media content. The relations between texts and images become an important basis for developing multimodal data and models. Some studies have attempted to label image-text relation (ITR) and build supervised learning models. However, manually labeling ITR is a challenging task and incurs many controversial labels because of disagreements among the annotators. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised multimodal method called ITR pseudo-labeling (ITRp) that learns multimodal representations for various ITR types using different finetuning strategies. Our ITRp method generates pseudo-labels by clustering and uses them as supervision to train the classifier and encoders. We evaluate the ITRp method on the ITR dataset and the effects of the samples with incorrect labels on both the supervised and unsupervised models. The code and data are available on the website https://github.com/SuYindu/ITRp.

AB In this note, I present my personal view on the interaction of the three areas Automated Programming, Symbolic Computation, and Machine Learning. Programming is the activity of finding a (hopefully) correct program (algorithm) for a given problem. Programming is central to automation in all areas and is considered one of the most creative human activities. However, already very early in the history of programming, people started to "jump to the meta-level" of programming, i.e., started to develop procedures that automate, or semi-automate, (various aspects or parts of) the process of programming. This area has various names like "Automated Programming", "Automated Algorithm Synthesis", etc. Developing compilers can be considered an early example of a problem in automated programming. Automated reasoners for proving the correctness of programs with respect to a specification is an advanced example of a topic in automated programming. ChatGPT producing (amazingly good) programs from problem specifications in natural language is a recent example of automated programming. Programming tends to become the most important activity as the level of technological sophistication increases. Therefore, automating programming is maybe the most exciting and relevant technological endeavor today. It also will have enormous impact on the global job market in the software industry. Roughly, I see two main approaches to automated programming:symbolic computationand machine learning. In this note, I explain how the two approaches work and that they are fundamentally different because they address two completely different ways of how problems are specified. Together, the two approaches constitute (part of) what some people like to call "artificial intelligence". In my analysis, both approaches are just part of (algorithmic) mathematics. The approaches, like all non-trivial mathematical methods, need quite some intelligence on the side of the human inventors of the methods. However, applying the methods is just "machine execution" of algorithms. It is misleading to call the application "machine intelligence" or "artificial intelligence". The analysis of the two approaches to automated programming also suggests that the two approaches, in the future, should be combined to achieve even higher levels of sophistication. At the end of this note, I propose some research questions for this new direction.

AB To develop a fast and effective image deblurring method, the blind recovery of motion-blurred images based on DeblurGAN(GAN, Generative Adversarial Networks) is researched.Firstly, the number of residual modules in the DeblurGAN network is changed, and an attempt is made to optimize the network structure to achieve better results in the blind recovery of motion-blurred images. Secondly, an image deblurring method based on the improved DeblurGAN network is proposed.This paper makes corresponding adjustments to the generator and discriminator networks to change their input and output size to 512 x 512 while keeping the overall structure of the network unchanged, and the experimental results show that the quality of the restored images has been greatly improved. In addition, the images were divided into four classes of images,to achieve improved restoration of blurred images with specific content. Experimental results on the benchmark GoPro dataset validate that the improved DeblurGAN achieves more than 1.5 dB improvement than DeblurGAN in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as trained utilizing the same amount of data, and structural similarity assessment (SSIM) evaluation means and maximum values increased between 0.2 and 0.3. The improved DeblurGAN is more effective in terms of both blur removal and detail recovery.
   Here, motion-blurred images are focused on as the object of study, by optimizing the generative adversarial network(GAN) model. firstly, by changing the number of residual modules in the network and trying to optimize the network structure, and secondly, by using a method of classifying the training image set and training different GANs. The improved DeblurGAN is more effective in terms of both blur removal and detail recovery.image

DE Reinforcement learning; Sparse reward; Cooperative multi-agent systems;
   Hierarchical framework; Two-stream structure
AB The sparse reward problem has long been one of the most challenging topics in the application of reinforcement learning (RL), especially in complex multi-agent systems. In this paper, a hierarchical multi-agent RL architecture is developed to address the sparse reward problem of cooperative tasks in continuous domain. The proposed architecture is divided into two levels: the higher-level meta-agent implements state transitions on a larger time scale to alleviate the sparse reward problem, which receives global observation as spatial information and formulates sub-goals for the lower-level agents; the lower-level agent receives local observation and sub-goal and completes the cooperative tasks. In addition, to improve the stability of the higher-level policy, a channel is built to transmit the lower-level policy to the meta-agent as temporal information, and then a two-stream structure is adopted in the actor-critic networks of the meta-agent to process spatial and temporal information. Simulation experiments on different tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively alleviates the sparse reward problem, so as to learn desired cooperative policies.

TI NeuralGLS: learning to guide local search with graph convolutional
   network for the traveling salesman problem
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Graph convolutional network; Guided local search; Traveling salesman
   problem
AB The traveling salesman problem (TSP) aims to find the shortest tour that visits each node of a given graph exactly once. TSPs have significant importance as numerous practical problems can be naturally formulated as TSPs. Various algorithms have been developed for solving TSPs, including combinatorial optimization algorithms and deep learning-based approaches. However, these algorithms often face a trade-off between providing exact solutions with long running times and delivering fast but approximate solutions. Therefore, achieving both efficiency and solution quality simultaneously remains a major challenge. In this study, we propose a data-driven algorithm called NeuralGLS to address this challenge. NeuralGLS is a hybrid algorithm that combines deep learning techniques with guided local search (GLS). It incorporates a self-adaptive graph convolutional network (GCN) that takes into account neighborhoods of varying sizes, accommodating TSP instances with different graph sizes. This GCN calculates a regret value for each edge in a given TSP instance. Subsequently, the algorithm utilizes a mixed strategy to construct an initial tour and then employs a GLS module to iteratively improve the tour guided by the acquired regret values until a high-quality tour is obtained. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets and real-world TSP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuralGLS in generating high-quality solutions within reasonable computation time. Furthermore, when compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, our NeuralGLS algorithm exhibits superior generalization performance on both real-world and larger-scale TSP instances. Notably, NeuralGLS also outperforms another hybrid algorithm that also incorporates GLS by reducing the mean optimality gap for real-world TSP instances from 1.318% to 0.958%, with both methods achieving results within the same computation time. This remarkable improvement in solution quality amounts to an impressive relative enhancement of 27.31%.

AB Numerous proposals and recommendations have been made in the development of underwater undulation robots, but very few studies have focused on the undulation characteristics of undulation robots. The undulating mode of the clearnose skate utilizing the activation of the pectoral fins in undulatory bursts is particularly suitable for slow and efficient swimming. Inspired by the working principle of the clearnose skate, herein, an undulation robotic structure is presented. Considering the hydrodynamic skeleton and propulsion mechanism of the clearnose skate, the solution is based on a piezoelectric composite for realizing undulatory propulsion. This approach leverages the converse piezoelectric effect and modal coupling to produce the desired undulating motion, thereby achieving the undulation design of the robot. The proposed robotic structure can realize the propulsion mode using piezoelectric composites to undulate in the same direction and can use the clockwise or counterclockwise undulation of piezoelectric composites to achieve the steering mode. In addition, finite element analysis is employed as an approach to investigate the undulation characteristics and transient vibration characteristics of the robot. The operational efficiency of the robotic structure is assessed through experiments. The results show that the propulsion mode achieves the speed of 3.33 body-length s-1. The steering mode exhibits the steering velocities of 17.4 deg s-1.
   A biomimetic undulation underwater robotic structure is proposed. The piezoelectric composites of the structure will generate traveling waves under the electric excitation. The proposed robotic structure exhibits dual functionality, capable of functioning in both propulsion and steering. Additionally, this study introduces a finite element analysis-based approach to analyze the undulation characteristics and time domain behavior of the structure.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer great potential in various fields like superconductivity, quantum systems, and topological materials. However, designing them systematically remains challenging due to the limited pool of fewer than 100 experimentally synthesized 2D materials. Recent advancements in deep learning, data mining, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have paved the way for exploring new 2D material candidates. Herein, a generative material design pipeline known as the material transformer generator (MTG) is proposed. MTG leverages two distinct 2D material composition generators, both trained using self-learning neural language models rooted in transformers, with and without transfer learning. These models generate numerous potential 2D compositions, which are plugged into established templates for known 2D materials to predict their crystal structures. To ensure stability, DFT computations assess their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy metrics. MTG has found four new DFT-validated stable 2D materials: NiCl4, IrSBr, CuBr3, and CoBrCl, all with zero energy-above-hull values that indicate thermodynamic stability. Additionally, GaBrO and NbBrCl3 are found with energy-above-hull values below 0.05 eV. CuBr3 and GaBrO exhibit dynamic stability, confirmed by phonon dispersion analysis. In summary, the MTG pipeline shows significant potential for discovering new 2D and functional materials.
   A neural language model-based generative material design pipeline called the material transformer generator (MTG) is proposed to generate numerous potential 2D material compositions and predict their crystal structures. Through extensive validation using density functional theory, the study identifies four stable 2D materials and two others with promising stability, demonstrating MTG's potential in discovering novel 2D materials and functional materials.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Early diagnosis of cancer is crucial to improving the long-term survival rate of patients. However, commonly used tumor markers lack sensitivity and specificity for screening purposes. Herein, 10 diagnostic models for 10 common types of cancer are developed by extreme gradient boosting, incorporating 66 laboratory parameters. The datasets consist of a retrospective cohort of 737 503 training and 184 012 validation cases, and a prospective cohort of 174 894 cases for model testing. The areas under the curve of the 10 diagnostic models range from 0.763 to 0.993. Notably, the different models have varying numbers of identical parameters among the 66 test features. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanation analysis reveals that 54 nontumor markers contributed significantly to the models. Cosine similarity analysis and clustering analysis demonstrate that some of the 10 cancers share common pathophysiological characteristics. Feature-based inference graph models are thus performed and infer relationships between nontumor index parameters and cancers with strong correlations. In conclusion, a machine learning-based pan-cancer early warning system has been established in this study, which can guide doctors in selecting more accurate testing indicators and assessing the risk of 10 types of cancer with greater precision.
   The extreme gradient boosting algorithm and clinical laboratory data are used to develop diagnostic models for 10 common cancers. By the Apriori algorithm and Bayesian statistics, feature-based inferential graph models are constructed to study the relationships between cancers. These findings can provide guidance to doctors for selecting more accurate testing indicators, and assessing disease risk with greater precision.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID ALGORITHM
AB IT services can be requested via cloud computing, a model based on services as well as the Internet. It includes all computer systems resources from hardware components to software platforms and software applications in a distributed environment. Scheduling is a key step in processing tasks using remote resources. Serious issues have been brought forward, including the ineffective use of resources and task execution failure. The concurrent provision of fault tolerance and resource optimisation is achallenging task. In the context of cloud computing, this research offers a brand-new job scheduling and fault-tolerant system. Tasks submitted by users are taken as an input for the proposed method. Several virtual machines (VM) are initially arranged for scheduling work and execution process. Initially, Horse Herd Optimisation is employed here to allocate the job based on key factors such as deadline and user budget. Once the jobs are assigned to each VM, then each job's deadline is confirmed and transferred to VM which has sufficient capacity. Here, the Reptile Search Optimisation technique is applied to identify the VM error. Any VM that does not have enough capacity is the one that has a problem. When a fault is found, a fault-tolerant process is instantly started. A replication-based fault-tolerant mechanism is used in this manuscript. The proposed approach is tested with several metrics which attains better performance like 80 s response time, turnaround time of 32 s, 17% resource utilisation and a success rate of 92%. Thus the designed model is the best choice for fault-tolerant aware task scheduling.

DT Article; Early Access
DE computer vision; convolutional neural nets; image classification
AB Although multimodal face data have obvious advantages in describing live and spoofed features, single-modality face antispoofing technologies are still widely used when it is difficult to obtain multimodal face images or inconvenient to integrate and deploy multimodal sensors. Since the live/spoofed representations in visible light facial images include considerable face identity information interference, existing deep learning-based face antispoofing models achieve poor performance when only the visible light modality is used. To address the above problems, the authors design a dual-channel network structure and a constrained representation learning method for face antispoofing. First, they design a dual-channel attention mechanism-based grouped convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn important deceptive cues in live and spoofed faces. Second, they design inner contrastive estimation-based representation constraints for both live and spoofed samples to minimise the sample similarity loss to prevent the CNN from learning more facial appearance information. This increases the distance between live and spoofed faces and enhances the network's ability to identify deceptive cues. The evaluation results indicate that the framework we designed achieves an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.37% on the visible light modality subset of the CASIA-SURF dataset and an ACER of 2.4% on the CASIA-SURF CeFA dataset, outperforming existing methods. The proposed method achieves low ACER scores in cross-dataset testing, demonstrating its advantage in domain generalisation.
   A grouped convolutional neural network based on the dual-channel attention mechanism is proposed to learn the deception cues in single-modality live and spoofed faces. An ICE representation constraint is designed to minimise the distribution distance of similar samples, eliminate the interference of facial appearance information, and improve the face antispoofing performance.image

AB This paper proposes a nonparametric point cloud filter to address the issue that existing point cloud filtering methods cannot retain important point cloud features after filtering and often require complex parameter adjustments. Firstly, a nonparametric clustering method is proposed to cluster various features of the point cloud and filter out isolated outliers. Then, the manifold distance truncation method is adopted to remove the outlier cluster generated by the point cloud clustering to complete point cloud filtering. Additionally, the proposed nonparametric clustering algorithm is compared with four of the latest clustering algorithms, including K-means clustering and OPTICS clustering to verify the rationality of the clustering features. Finally, the filtering results of the nonparametric point cloud filter are compared with those of statistical filtering and two other recently proposed point cloud filters to demonstrate its improved filtering effect and algorithm stability. The experimental results indicate that the proposed nonparametric point cloud filter can achieve better-filtering results and retain more point cloud features without adjusting parameters.
   (1) By restoring weight from data, the difficulty in determining the initial parameters of the point cloud filter can be solved. (2) Using manifold distance instead of Euclidean distance can better retain the spatial characteristics of the point cloud. (3) The no-gap test method can better cluster the characteristics of point clouds. This is significant because to solve the problems of incomplete feature retention and excessive parameters of point cloud filtering.image

AB Knowledge graph (KG) has been fully considered in natural language generation (NLG) tasks. A KG can help models generate controllable text and achieve better performance. However, most existing related approaches still lack explainability and scalability in large-scale knowledge reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel CogNLG framework for KG-to-text generation tasks. Our CogNLG is implemented based on the dual-process theory in cognitive science. It consists of two systems: one system acts as the analytic system for knowledge extraction, and another is the perceptual system for text generation by using existing knowledge. During text generation, CogNLG provides a visible and explainable reasoning path. Our framework shows excellent performance on all datasets and achieves a BLEU score of 36.7, which increases by 6.7 compared to the best competitor.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition. Its early and accurate diagnosis is critical in enhancing the quality of life for affected individuals. Graph neural networks supply promising approaches for ASD diagnosis. However, existing works typically focus on brain-level or population-level classification methods, where the former usually disregards subjects' non-imaging information and inter-subject relationships, and the latter generally fails to adequately evaluate and detect disease-associated brain regions and biomarkers. Furthermore, relatively static graph structures and shallow network architectures hinder the abundant extraction of information, affecting the performance of ASD identification. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new spectral graph network with brain-population graph structure joint learning (BPGLNet) for ASD diagnosis. This new framework involves two main components. Firstly, a brain-level graph learning module is designed to acquire valuable features of brain regions and identify effective biomarkers for each subject. In particular, it constructs a brain-aware representation learning network by fusing an improved graph pooling strategy and spectral graph convolution to learn subgraph structures and features of brain regions. Subsequently, based on these generated features, a population-level graph learning module is developed to capture relationships between different subjects. It builds an adaptive edge generator network by integrating non-imaging and imaging data, forming a learnable population graph. Further, this module also devises a deep cascade spectral graph network to enrich high-level feature representation of data and complete ASD identification. Experiments on the benchmark dataset reveal the state-of-the-art performance of BPGLNet.

AB Most reconstruction-based multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection methods tend to learn point-wise information, failing to extract a robust overall representation. Some studies have tried to introduce contrastive learning to alleviate this problem, but two key challenges remain: (1) Most data augmentation approaches follow the inductive bias from computer vision, which may destroy the time series patterns. (2) The instance discrimination proxy task of traditional contrastive learning will cause the generation of numerous false negative samples and the loss of common information when applied to MTS anomaly detection. In this paper, a contrastive autoencoder with multi-resolution segment-consistency discrimination (MRSCD) is proposed for MTS anomaly detection. Firstly, a time series data augmentation method is proposed, which constructs positive and negative samples by down-sampling the original time series in different resolutions and orders. Then an encoder is used to extract different levels of temporal information from the multi-resolution sample pairs which are randomly combined by positive and negative samples with the same resolution. Finally, a proxy task of segment-consistency discrimination is proposed for contrastive autoencoder to distinguish positive and negative sample pairs through the order of the down-sampled segments, enabling the model to extract inter-segment contextual information at the same time as learning point-wise information. The experimental results on five public datasets show that MRSCD significantly outperforms the baseline methods in three evaluation metrics.

AB This article focuses on a novel robust optimal parallel tracking control method for continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems subject to uncertainties. First, the designed virtual controller facilitates the transformation of the original nonlinear system into an affine system with an augmented state vector, which promotes the introduction of the optimal parallel tracking control problem. Then, this article generates fresh insight into counteracting the effects of uncertainty by developing a novel parallel control system that invokes the formulated virtual control law and an auxiliary variable obtained from the relationship between the solutions of the optimal control problems for the uncertain system and the nominal one. Next, critic neural networks (NNs) approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations' solution to implement the proposed robust optimal control method via adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the proposed method's remarkable effectiveness.

AB With the spring up of high-rise building projects, tower crane layout planning (TCLP) is increasingly crucial to avoid construction costs, safety issues, and productivity deficiencies. Current optimization approaches require manual data extraction and become more complex as projects scale growing. To further alleviate the planning burden, an automatic TCLP system is proposed, using a generative adversarial network (GAN) called CraneGAN. It generates tower crane layouts from drawing inputs, eliminating the need for manual information extraction. CraneGAN is trained on a high-quality dataset and evaluated based on its computational time and crane transportation time. By adjusting hyperparameters and applying data augmentation, CraneGAN achieves robust and efficient results compared to genetic algorithms (GA) and the exact analytics method. After validating through a numerical analysis for construction project, this proposed approach overcomes complexity limitations and streamlines the manual data extraction process to better facilitate layout planning decision-making.

AB Ensemble learning aims to improve prediction performance by combining several models or forecasts. However, how much and which ensemble learning techniques are useful in deep learning-based pipelines for pancreas computed tomography (CT) image classification is a challenge. Ensemble approaches are the most advanced solution to many machine learning problems. These techniques entail training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve the predictive performance of a single model. This article introduces the idea of Stacked Ensemble Deep Learning (SEDL), a pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. The weak learners are Inception V3, VGG16, and ResNet34, and we employed a stacking ensemble. By combining the first-level predictions, an input train set for XGBoost, the ensemble model at the second level of prediction, is created. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), employed as a strong learner, will make the final classification. Our findings showed that SEDL performed better, with a 98.8% ensemble accuracy, after some adjustments to the hyperparameters. The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) public access dataset consists of 80 pancreas CT scans with a resolution of 512 * 512 pixels, from 53 male and 27 female subjects. A sample of two hundred and twenty-two images was used for training and testing data. We concluded that implementing the SEDL technique is an effective way to strengthen the robustness and increase the performance of the pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. Interestingly, grouping like-minded or talented learners does not make a difference.

ID CONSENSUS
AB The leader-following cooperative problem in heterogeneous multiagent systems (HMASs) with unmodeled dynamics and actuator faults is investigated in this article. The HMASs, which include unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, are first described using a fully actuated system model (FASM). The FASM, as opposed to the first-order state-space model, preserves the physical significance of original systems and makes it feasible to apply the control rule entirely. In order to approximate unknown system dynamics, novel neuroadaptive laws with few learning parameters are then suggested. To counteract the negative effects of actuator faults, the Nussbaum function and adaptive approach are utilized. In addition, a cooperative fault-tolerant protocol is suggested, wherein consensus errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. The lack of virtual control variables in the proposed protocol reduces its complexity. The theoretical results are then validated by numerical simulations.

AB Currently, most robot dances are pre-compiled, the requirement of manual adjustment of relevant parameters and meta-action to change the dancing to another type of music would greatly reduce its function. To overcome the gap, this study proposed a dance composition model for mobile robots based on multimodal information. The model consists of three parts. (1) Extraction of multimodal information. The temporal structure feature method of structure analysis framework is used to divide audio music files into music structures; then, a hierarchical emotion detection framework is used to extract information (rhythm, emotion, tension, etc.) for each segmented music structure; calculating the safety of the current car and surrounding objects in motion; finally, extracting the stage color of the robot's location, corresponding to the relevant atmosphere emotions. (2) Initialize the dance library. Dance composition is divided into four categories based on the classification of music emotions; in addition, each type of dance composition is divided into skilled composition and general dance composition. (3) The total path length can be obtained by combining multimodal information based on different emotions, initial speeds, and music structure periods; then, target point planning can be carried out based on the specific dance composition selected. An adaptive control framework based on the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) and compensation controllers is used to track the target point trajectory, and finally, the selected dance composition is formed. Mobile robot dance composition provides a new method and concept for humanoid robot dance composition.

AB Herein, the impact of cross-temperature on 3D NAND flash memory is modeled by considering adjacent cells using machine learning. The cells comprising NAND flash memory exhibit diverse states and connectivity patterns. To effectively capture this complexity, the 3D NAND flash is converted to graph structure and the graph neural network (GNN) is leveraged, known for its exceptional performance in handling graph data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to model 3D NAND flash memory using GNN. This method has good generalization performance across various retention times and temperatures, achieving a remarkable overlap of 95.28% between ground truth and predicted distributions. Moreover, two applications of this method are introduced that contribute to the NAND flash memory improvement. One is a GNN-assist program, which leverages well-trained GNN to suppress the Vth$V_{\text{th}}$ degradation affected by cross-temperature, resulting in reduced Vth$V_{\text{th}}$ shift and narrower Vth$V_{\text{th}}$ distribution width. The other is the sensitivity decomposition to identify parameters influencing the cell at cross-temperature. It is found that cross-temperature impact extends beyond physically connected cells to adjacent cells at close distances. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into modeling 3D NAND flash memory using GNNs and offers practical methods for enhancing NAND flash memory reliability.
   Herein, a graph neural network models the electric characteristics for cross-temperature in 3D NAND flash memory. The threshold voltage of individual cells is predicted with the graph structure data that is transformed from the structural characteristics of 3D NAND flash memory. Then, two applications are proposed to enhance the reliability of 3D NAND flash memory.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID DYNAMIC TASK ALLOCATION; MULTIAGENT
AB In many real-world applications of AI, the set of actors and tasks are not constant, but instead change over time. Robots tasked with suppressing wildfires eventually run out of limited suppressant resources and need to temporarily disengage from the collaborative work in order to recharge, or they might become damaged and leave the environment permanently. In a large business organization, objectives and goals change with the market, requiring workers to adapt to perform different sets of tasks across time. We call these multiagent systems (MAS) open agent systems (OASYS), and the openness of the sets of agents and tasks necessitates new capabilities and modeling for decision making compared to planning and learning in closed environments. In this article, we discuss three notions of openness: agent openness, task openness, and type openness. We also review the past and current research on addressing the novel challenges brought about by openness in OASYS. We share lessons learned from these efforts and suggest directions for promising future work in this area. We also encourage the community to engage and participate in this area of MAS research to address critical real-world problems in the application of AI to enhance our daily lives.

AB Aspect-level sentiment classification task (ASCT) is a natural language processing task that aims to correctly identify specific aspects and determine their sentiment polarity from a given target sentence. Deep learning models have been proven to be effective in aspect-based sentiment classification tasks, and the mainstream Aspect level sentiment classification (ASC) models currently constructed generally assume that the training and test datasets are Gaussian distribution (e.g., the same language). Once the data distribution changes, the ASC model must be retrained on the new distribution data to achieve good performance. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled data again typically requires a lot of manpower and money, which seems unlikely, especially for the ASC task, as it requires aspect-level annotation. This article analyzes the performance of sequence-based models, graph-based convolutional neural networks, and pre-training language models on the aspect-level sentiment classification task using two sets of comment datasets in Chinese and English, from four perspectives: classification performance, performance with different aspect numbers, specific case performance, and computational cost. In this article, we design a state-of-the-art ASCbased classification method and conduct a systematic study on eight public standard English and Chinese datasets with various commonly used assessment measures that provide directions for cross-language migration. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the study as well as future research directions.

AB Due to global warming and climate change, the poultry industry is heavily impacted, especially the broiler industry, due to the sensitive immune system of broiler chickens. However, the continuous monitoring and controlling of the farm's environmental parameters can help to curtail the negative impacts of the environment on chickens' health, leading to increased meat production. This article presents smart solutions to such issues, which are practically implemented, and have low production and operational costs. In this article, an Internet of Things (IoT) based environmental parameters monitoring has been demonstrated for the poultry farmhouse. This system enables the collection and visualization of crucially sensed data automatically and reliably, and at a low cost to efficiently manage and operate a poultry farm. The proposed IoT-based remote monitoring system collects and visualizes environmental parameters, such as air temperature, relative humidity (RH), oxygen level (O-2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3) gas concentrations. The wireless sensor nodes have been designed and deployed for efficient data collection of the essential environmental parameters that are key for monitoring and decision-making process. The hardware is implemented and deployed successfully at a site within the control shed of the poultry farmhouse. The results revealed important findings related to the environmental conditions within the poultry farm. The temperature inside the control sheds remained within the desired range throughout the monitoring period, with daily average values ranging from 32 degrees C to 34 degrees C. The RH showed slight variations monitoring period, ranging from 65% to 75%, with a daily average of 70%. The O-2 concentration exhibited an average value of 17% to 18.5% throughout the monitoring period. The CO2 levels showed occasional increases, reaching a maximum value of 1,100 ppm. However, this value was below the maximum permissible level of 2,500 ppm, indicating that the ventilation system was effective in maintaining acceptable CO2 levels within the control sheds. The NH3 gas concentration remained consistently low throughout the duration, with an average value of 50 parts per million (ppm).

   programming model; Portfolio optimization; Open dimension
AB In the field of e-commerce warehousing, maximizing the utilization of packing bins is a fundamental goal for all major logistics enterprises. However, determining the appropriate size of packing bins poses a practical challenge for many logistics companies. Given the limited research on the open-size 3D bin packing problem as well as the high complexity and lengthy computation time of existing models, this study focuses on optimizing multiple-bin sizes within the e-commerce context. Building upon existing research, we propose a hybrid integer programming model, denoted as the three dimensional multiple option dimensional rectangular packing problem (3DMODRPP), to address the multiple-bin size 3D bin packing problem. Additionally, we leverage well-established hardware and software technologies to propose a 3D bin packing system capable of accommodating multiple bin types with open dimensions. To reduce the complexity of the model and the number of constraints, we introduce a novel assumption method for 0-1 integer variables in the overlap and rotation constraints. By applying this approach, we significantly streamline the computational complexity associated with the model calculations. Furthermore, we refine the dataset by developing a customized version based on the classical Three-Dimensional One-Size Dependent Rectangular Packing Problem (3D-ODRPP) dataset, leading to improved outcomes. Through comprehensive analysis of the research results, our model exhibits remarkable advancements in addressing the strong heterogeneous bin packing problem, the weak heterogeneous bin packing problem, the actual bin packing problem, and the bin packing problem with multiple bin types and open sizes. Specifically, it significantly reduces model complexity and computation time and increases space utilization. The system designed in this study paves the way for practical applications based on the proposed model, providing researchers with broader research prospects and directions to expand the scope of investigation in the field of 3D bin packing. Consequently, this system contributes to solving complex 3D packing problems, reducing space waste, and enhancing transportation efficiency.

AB Quantifying fault severity is a critical part of rolling bearing health management. There are numerous methods for evaluating the severity of rolling bearing faults that utilize various signals to predict the remaining useful life (RUL). However, the fault severity assessment methods based on digital twins still cannot accurately track the fault evolution. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data/physics-driven digital twin model for predicting the RUL of rolling bearings. Firstly, using theoretical damage mechanics, the evolution of fatigue damage of rolling bearings throughout their entire life cycle is described, for which a spalling fatigue evolution model is constructed. Secondly, fatigue defects predicted by the spalling fatigue evolution model are introduced into a dynamic model to construct a bearing high-fidelity model. Thirdly, a local-to-global dynamic updating framework is designed for the interactive coupling of real-time monitoring data of rolling bearings and corresponding simulated data, as well as updating the high-fidelity model parameters. Finally, a neural network is used to predict the RUL of rolling bearings. The approach is verified using test data of rolling bearings. The results demonstrate that the proposed digital twin model can more accurately address the problem of RUL prediction of rolling bearings.

ID OPERATIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RESTORATION
AB Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) have recently been proposed as new-generation neural network models with nonlinear learning units, i.e., the generative neurons that yield an elegant level of diversity; however, like its predecessor, conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they still have a common drawback: localized (fixed) kernel operations. This severely limits the receptive field and information flow between layers and thus brings the necessity for deep and complex models. It is highly desired to improve the receptive field size without increasing the kernel dimensions. This requires a significant upgrade over the generative neurons to achieve the "non-localized kernel operations" for each connection between consecutive layers. In this article, we present superior (generative) neuron models (or super neurons in short) that allow random or learnable kernel shifts and thus can increase the receptive field size of each connection. The kernel localization process varies among the two super-neuron models. The first model assumes randomly localized kernels within a range and the second one learns (optimizes) the kernel locations during training. An extensive set of comparative evaluations against conventional and deformable convolutional, along with the generative neurons demonstrates that super neurons can empower Self-ONNs to achieve a superior learning and generalization capability with a minimal computational complexity burden. PyTorch implementation of Self-ONNs with super-neurons is now publically shared.

In this study, a SqueezeNet model for IoT threat detection is built using Sine Cosine Sea Lion Optimization (SCSLnO). The Base Station (BS) carries out intrusion detection. The Hausdorff distance is used to determine which features are important. Using the SqueezeNet model, attack detection is carried out, and the network classifier is trained using SCSLnO, which is developed by combining the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) with Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). BoT-IoT and NSL-KDD datasets are used for the analysis. In comparison to existing approaches, PSO-KNN/SVM, Voting Ensemble Classifier, Deep NN, and Deep learning, the accuracy value produced by devised method for the BoT-IoT dataset is 10.75%, 8.45%, 6.36%, and 3.51% higher when the training percentage is 90.

TI A method for multiple-sequence-alignment-free protein structure
   prediction using a protein language model
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Protein structure prediction pipelines based on artificial intelligence, such as AlphaFold2, have achieved near-experimental accuracy. These advanced pipelines mainly rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as inputs to learn the co-evolution information from the homologous sequences. Nonetheless, searching MSAs from protein databases is time consuming, usually taking tens of minutes. Consequently, we attempt to explore the limits of fast protein structure prediction by using only primary structures of proteins. Our proposed method, HelixFold-Single, combines a large-scale protein language model with the superior geometric learning capability of AlphaFold2. HelixFold-Single first pre-trains a large-scale protein language model with thousands of millions of primary structures utilizing the self-supervised learning paradigm, which will be used as an alternative to MSAs for learning the co-evolution information. Then, by combining the pre-trained protein language model and the essential components of AlphaFold2, we obtain an end-to-end differentiable model to predict the three-dimensional coordinates of atoms from only the primary structure. HelixFold-Single is validated on datasets CASP14 and CAMEO, achieving competitive accuracy with the MSA-based methods on targets with large homologous families. Furthermore, HelixFold-Single consumes much less time than the mainstream pipelines for protein structure prediction, demonstrating its potential in tasks requiring many predictions.
   AlphaFold2 has revolutionized bioinformatics, but its ability to predict protein structures with high accuracy comes at the price of a costly database search for multiple sequence alignments. Fang and colleagues pre-train a large-scale protein language model and use it in conjunction with AlphaFold2 as a fully trainable and efficient model for structure prediction.

ID NEWS CONSUMPTION; SOCIAL MEDIA; POLARIZATION
AB Despite AI-driven recommendation algorithms being widely adopted to counter information overload, substantial evidence suggests that they are building cocoons of homogeneous contents and viewpoints, further aggravating social polarization and prejudice. Curbing these perils requires a deep insight into the origin of information cocoons. Here we investigate information cocoons in the real world using two large datasets and find that a large number of users are trapped in information cocoons. Further empirical analysis suggests that two ingredients, each corresponding to a fundamental mechanism in human-AI interaction systems, are correlated with the loss of information diversity. Grounded on the empirical findings, we derive a mechanistic model for the adaptive information dynamics in complex human-AI interaction systems governed by these fundamental mechanisms. It allows us to predict critical transitions between three states: diversification, partial information cocoons, and deep information cocoons. Our work not only empirically traces real-world information cocoons in two representative scenarios, but also theoretically unearths basic mechanisms governing the emergence of information cocoons. We provide a theoretical method for understanding major social issues resulting from adaptive information dynamics in complex human-AI interaction systems.
   It is widely known that AI-based recommendation systems on social media and news websites can isolate humans from diverse information, eventually trapping them in so-called information cocoons, where they are exposed to a narrow range of viewpoints. Li et al. introduce an adaptive information dynamics model to uncover the origin of information cocoons in complex human-AI interaction systems, and test their findings on two large real-world datasets.

   optimisation; mobile robots; safe reinforcement learning
AB When deploying mobile robots in real-world scenarios, such as airports, train stations, hospitals, and schools, collisions with pedestrians are intolerable and catastrophic. Motion safety becomes one of the most fundamental requirements for mobile robots. However, until now, efficient and safe robot navigation in such dynamic environments is still an open problem. The critical reason is that the inconsistency between navigation efficiency and motion safety is greatly intensified by the high dynamics and uncertainties of pedestrians. To face the challenge, this paper proposes a safe deep reinforcement learning algorithm named Conflict-Averse Safe Reinforcement Learning (CASRL) for autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments. Specifically, it first separates the collision avoidance sub-task from the overall navigation task and maintains a safety critic to evaluate the safety/risk of actions. Later, it constructs two task-specific but model-agnostic policy gradients for goal-reaching and collision avoidance sub-tasks to eliminate their mutual interference. Then, it further performs a conflict-averse gradient manipulation to address the inconsistency between two sub-tasks. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the superiority of CASRL. Simulation results show an average 8.2% performance improvement over the vanilla baseline in eight groups of dynamic environments, which is further extended to 13.4% in the most challenging group. Besides, forty real-world experiments fully illustrated that the CASRL could be successfully deployed on a real robot.

AB Unstructured and unorganized data always degrade the performance of search techniques and produce irrelevant results in response to the query as well as decrease the speed of retrieval results. Ontology in semantic web (SW) provides an adequate solution to represent the knowledge, because of its backbone knowledge of an application or domain. But, domain ontology has three basic problems while retrieving useful knowledge from a domain ontology: (a) structuring/arrangement, (b) unnecessary knowledge reduction, selection and extraction, and (c) speeding up the retrieval process. To resolve these problems, we proposed multi-level k-mean clustering approach with rough set and Bayesian network model for ontology (MLK-rBO). The proposed model works in four different phases-clustering, knowledge discovery, building a probabilistic network, and model evaluation. The model ensembles three different techniques, namely clustering, rough set (RS), and Bayesian network (BN). Finally, the proposed model is tested with statistical parameters and compared with other models, namely decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to evaluate performance. By analyzing experimental results, we observed that the MLK-rBO gives better accuracy: 98.36% for survey data (fever) and 86% for Wine quality data than available models.

AB There are many kinds of Exploit Kits, each one being built with several vulnerabilities, but almost all of them are written in JavaScript. So, we created an antivirus, endowed with machine learning, expert in detecting JavaScript malware based on Runtime Behaviors. In our methodology, JavaScript is executed, in a controlled environment. The goal was to investigate suspicious file behavior. Our antivirus, as a whole, dynamically monitors and ponders 7690 suspicious behaviors that the JavaScript file can do in Windows 7. As experiments, the authorial antivirus is compared to antiviruses based on deep as based on shallow networks. Our antivirus achieves an average accuracy of 99.75% in the distinction between benign and malware, accompanied by a training time of 8.92 s. Establishing the relationship between accuracy and training time is essential in information security. Eight (8) new malware are released every second. An antivirus with excessive training time can become obsolete even when released. As our proposed model can overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art, our antivirus combines high accuracy and fast training. In addition, the authorial antivirus is able to detect JavaScript malware, endowed with digital antiforense, such as obfuscates, polymorphic and fileless attacks.

   Pharmaceutical R&D: A Practical Perspective
SO KUNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Real world data; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning;
   Pharmaceutical research
AB Real world data (RWD) has become an important tool in pharmaceutical research and development. Generated every time patients interact with the healthcare system when diagnoses are developed and medical interventions are selected, RWD are massive and in many regards typical big data. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze RWD seems an obvious choice. It promises new insights into medical need, drivers of diseases, and new opportunities for pharmacological interventions. When put into practice RWD analyses are challenging. The distributed generation of data, under sub-optimally standardized conditions in a patient-oriented but not information maximizing healthcare transaction, leads to a high level of sparseness and uncontrolled biases. We discuss why this needs to be addressed independent of the type of analysis approach. While classical statistical analysis and modeling approaches provide a rigorous framework for the handling of bias and sparseness, AI methods are not necessarily suited when applied naively. Special precautions need to be taken from choice of method until interpretation of results to prevent potentially harmful fallacies. The conscious use of prior medical subject matter expertise may also be required. Based on typical application examples we illustrate challenges and methodological considerations.

ID PATTERN-RECOGNITION
AB Mobile manipulator robots that combine mobile platforms and robotic arms have been attracting considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, the motion control problem of the mobile manipulator system is considered with the following proposed control strategy. Firstly, a decoupled dynamic model is created to increase operation safety and to reduce complexity such that the independent controllers can be designed for the mobile system and the manipulator system. Subsequently, an effective reference trajectory generator is proposed to guide the mobile manipulator systems to the proper position for the manipulation being able to grip the target. Thereafter, the fuzzy controllers are designed for the mobile system to eliminate the tracking error and for the manipulator system to accomplish the gripping mission. The stability of the mobile manipulator control system can be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. From the simulation results, it can be seen that this paper as well as other compared methods have good control response in case of small controller gain, in which the convergence time are about 4-5 s. However, by increasing the controller gain to improve the control response, the other methods will make the system unstable or the controller output will produce a large amount of chattering. The proposed controller in this paper can not only decrease the convergence time, from 5 to 3 s, but also provide a smooth control response.

AB Among the most prevalent and serious retinal illnesses are glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension caused by diabetes, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration. If these disorders are not identified at an early stage, permanent eyesight loss ensues. Numerous anomalies in the retina, including microaneurysms, neovascularization, hemorrhages, soft exudates or cotton wool patches, and macular edema, serve as illustrations. Ophthalmologists employ automated technologies that analyze ophthalmic imaging modalities to quickly screen for and diagnose these illnesses. Due to the complexity of numerous diseases that have overlapping symptoms, accurate disease diagnosis has become more difficult in modern times. When it comes to medical diagnosis, this complexity presents a huge challenge for specialists working in health departments. Many academics and researchers are actively attempting to create novel approaches and solutions to deal with the difficulties in medical diagnostics. The goal of this research initiative is to develop cutting-edge techniques that can help professionals make more accurate disease diagnoses. The present work introduces the notion of confidence level for neutrosophic average and aggregation operators, which contrasts with neutrosophic rough average and geometric aggregation operators, which do not take into account the experts' familiarity with the objects being examined during the initial assessment. A more sophisticated structure of neutrosophic rough sets is used to calculate the confidence level, allowing for a more thorough review procedure. The fundamental traits of the suggested operators are also covered in the paper.

AB In this paper we introduce and develop the concept of interval-weighted networks (IWN), a novel approach in Social Network Analysis, where the edge weights are represented by closed intervals composed with precise information, comprehending intrinsic variability. We extend IWN for both Newman's modularity and modularity gain and the Louvain algorithm, considering a tabular representation of networks by contingency tables. We apply our methodology to two real-world IWN. The first is a commuter network in mainland Portugal, between the twenty three NUTS 3 Regions (IWCN). The second focuses on annual merchandise trade between 28 European countries, from 2003 to 2015 (IWTN). The optimal partition of geographic locations (regions or countries) is developed and compared using two new different approaches, designated as "Classic Louvain" and "Hybrid Louvain" , which allow taking into account the variability observed in the original network, thereby minimizing the loss of information present in the raw data. Our findings suggest the division of the twenty three Portuguese regions in three main communities for the IWCN and between two to three country communities for the IWTN. However, we find different geographical partitions according to the community detection methodology used. This analysis can be useful in many real-world applications, since it takes into account that the weights may vary within the ranges, rather than being constant.

In particular, cluster analysis is among the most successful and ubiquitous data exploration and characterisation techniques. In this work, we focus on how to represent networks ensembles for fuzzy clustering. We explore three different network representations based on probability distribution, autoencoders and joint embedding. We compare de facto standard fuzzy computational procedures for clustering multiple networks on synthetic data. Finally, we apply this approach to a real-world case study.

AB Many robust variants of Principal Component Analysis remove outliers from the data and compute the principal components of the remaining data. The robust centered variant requires knowledge of the center of the non-outliers. Unfortunately, the center of non-outliers is unknown until after the outliers are determined, and using an inaccurate center may lead to the detection of wrong outliers. We demonstrate this problem in several known robust PCA algorithms. We describe a method that implicitly centers the non-outliers, implemented by appending a constant value (bias) to each data point. This bias method can be used with "black box" robust PCA algorithms by augmenting their input with minimal change to the algorithm itself.

DE Feature redundancy; Generalization ability; Multi-scale feature
   extraction; Orthogonally constrain; Sentence classification
AB The core of sentence classification is to extract sentence semantic features. The existing hybrid methods have huge parameters and complex models. Due to the limited dataset, these methods are prone to feature redundancy and overfitting. To address this issue, this paper proposes an orthogonal independent Bi-GRU sentence classification model with multi-scale feature extraction, called Multi-scale Orthogonal Independent Bi-GRU (MODE-Bi-GRU). First, the hidden state of the Bi-GRU model is split into multiple small hidden states, and the corresponding recursive matrix is constrained orthogonally. Then, multiple sliding windows of different sizes are defined according to the forward and reverse angles of the sentence, and the sliding window is obtained. Finally, different sentence fragments are superimposed and input to the model, and the output results of multiple small Bi-GRU models are spliced and processed by soft pooling. The improved focal loss function is adopted to speed up the convergence of the model. Compared to the existing models, our proposed model achieves better results on four benchmark datasets, and it has better generalization ability with fewer parameters.

ID ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS; DEEP
AB Deep neural network approaches to inverse imaging problems have produced impressive results in the last few years. In this survey paper, we consider the use of generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems. The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training dataset. We name this family generative regularisers. The success of generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so we propose a set of desired criteria to assess generative models and guide future research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common generative models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three different generative regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring, deconvolution, and tomography. We show that restricting solutions of the inverse problem to lie exactly in the range of a generative model can give good results but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator produces more consistent results. Finally, we discuss future directions and open problems in the field.

DE Image super-resolution; Deep-learning; Attention mechanism; Gated

AB Deep-learning based methods have achieved great success in the field of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) by progressively exploring contextual and deep semantic features. However, existing methods do not make full use of scale-space features, resulting in the restoration of high-resolution image details being blurred. In order to address this issue, the Dense-Gated Network is proposed for SISR, called DGISR, which consists of two essential blocks: Pyramid Multi-scale Extraction Block (PMEB) and Gated Attention Distillation Block (GADB). The proposed PMEB allows capturing and integrating more complex features through pyramid pooling and multi-scale operation to enhance the modeling capability of the network. The proposed GADB can extract key regions of images and reduce data redundancy, while improving the convergence of the model. The proposed DGISR outperforms other methods in visual quality and quantitative metrics on the standard benchmark datasets, as demonstrated by experimental results. Our overall method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

DE Nonlinear dynamic system; Mechanism modeling; Dirichlet graph
   convolution; Graph representation learning; Neural differential equation
AB In recent years, multivariate time series prediction has attracted extensive research interests. However, the dynamic changes of the spatial topology and the temporal evolution of multivariate variables bring great challenges to the spatio-temporal time series prediction. In this paper, a novel Dirichlet graph convolution module is introduced to automatically learn the spatio-temporal representation, and we combine graph attention (GAT) and neural differential equation (NDE) based on nonlinear state transition to model spatio-temporal state evolution of nonlinear systems. Specifically, the spatial topology is revealed by the cosine similarity of node embeddings. The use of multi-layer Dirichlet graph convolution aims to enhance the representation ability of the model while suppressing the phenomenon of over-smoothing or over-separation. The GCN and LSTM-based network is used as the nonlinear operator to model the evolution law of the dynamic system, and the GAT updates the strength of the connection. In addition, the Euler trapezoidal integral method is used to model the temporal dynamics and makes medium and long-term prediction in latent space from the perspective of nonlinear state transition. The proposed model can adaptively mine spatial correlations and discover spatio-temporal dynamic evolution patterns through the coupled NDE, which makes the modeling process more interpretable. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of spatio-temporal dynamic discovery on predictive performance.

AB The problem of adaptive fault-tolerant fixed-time control is studied for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with multiple faults and multiple disturbances. We incorporate the tuning functions and the command filter technique into the controller design. Note that the former reduces the order of the controller, and the latter simplifies the derivation and calculation process and avoids the high calculation cost and differential explosion. In addition, since our proposed strategy is based on fixed-time control, it can ensure that the closed-loop system keeps the practically fixed-time stable, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood near the origin within fixed-time. As for the unknown items in the systems, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate them. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective even if there exist actuator faults and multiple disturbances.

AB This work proposes a novel reptile search algorithm (RSA) to solve optimization problems called reinforcement reptile search algorithm (RLRSA). The basic RSA performs exploitation through highly walking in the first half of searching process while the exploration phase is executed through the hunting phase in the second half. Therefore, the algorithm is not able to balance exploration and exploitation and this behavior results in trapping in local optima. A novel learning method based on reinforcement learning and Q-learning model is proposed to balance the exploitation and exploration phases when the solution starts deteriorating. Furthermore, the random opposite-based learning (ROBL) is introduced to increase the diversity of the population and so enhance the obtained solutions. Twenty-three typical benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions, were employed to assess the performance of RLRSA. According to the findings, the RLRSA method surpasses the standard RSA approach in the majority of benchmark functions evaluated, specifically in 12 out of 13 unimodal functions, 9 out of 13 multimodal functions, and 8 out of 10 fixed multimodal functions. Furthermore, the RLRSA is applied to vessel solve pressure and tension/compression spring design problems. The results show that RLRSA significantly found the solution with minimum cost. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the RLRSA compared to RSA and other optimization methods in the literature.

DE Temporal modelling; Adaptive areas; Long-range temporal information;

AB Temporal modelling is still challenging for action recognition in video. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a new video architecture, called Adaptive Region Aware (ARP) network. The network focuses on combining short-range temporal information with long-range temporal information to perform effective action recognition. The core of our ARP is the Movement and Spatial-Temporal module (MST), which is made up of two modules, movement information and Spatial-Temporal information. MST uses the idea of difference for short-range temporal information extraction and adaptive region sensing and temporal convolution for long-range temporal information extraction. To extract temporal information for the entire video, our MST module contains two branches. Specifically, for local temporal information, we use the difference in motion between successive frames to extract a fine-grained representation of the motion, thus obtaining short-range temporal information. For the global temporal information, we use adaptive region awareness for feature extraction of the whole video to enhance the representation of the model in the spatio-temporal domain, and use temporal convolution for modelling to obtain our long-range temporal information. We insert the MST module into ResNet-50 to build our ARP network and experiment on the Something V1, Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets with optimal performance.

AB Recently, video super-resolution has achieved an outstanding performance. However, many existing methods to solve video super-resolution usually make use of complex strategies, such as explicit optical flow, deformable convolution, which increase complexity and computation. In this paper, we propose a lightweight network for video super-resolution, namely Efficient Lightweight Network for Video Super-Resolution (ELNVSR). We design a Multi-group Block extracting long-distance spatial information to construct a lightweight Bidirection Alignment Module which is implicitly capable of fusing and propagating spatial-temporal information in a bidirectional way.

AB Neural topic models have triggered a surge of interest in extracting topics from text automatically since they avoid the sophisticated derivations in conventional topic models. However, most of these models only utilize word count information, which will result in low coherent topics. To address this issue, we explore the way to incorporate word relatedness in word embeddings into the topic modeling process and propose the novel Variational Gaussian Topic Model (VaGTM). Based on the variational auto-encoder, the proposed VaGTM models each topic with a multivariate Gaussian in the decoder to group the semantically similar words together and obtains more coherent topics. Moreover, to address the limitation that pre-trained word embedding of topic-associated words does not exactly follows Gaussian, we extend the VaGTM and propose the Variational Gaussian Topic Model with Invertible neural Projections (VaGTM-IP). Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark text corpora, and the experimental results show that VaGTM and VaGTM-IP outperform several competitive baselines in terms of four topic coherence metrics. Besides, the proposed approaches could also mine topic correlations between extracted topics with topic-associated Gaussian distributions.

AB Assist-as-needed control with a soft robotic hand glove for active rehabilitation is studied in this work. There are two resources of the grasping force, the robotic glove and the subject. Compared with traditional passive rehabilitation where the grasping force is merely provided by a robotic hand rehabilitation device (such as hand exoskeleton, robotic glove), assist-as-needed control accounts for the user contribute to performing grasping tasks collaboratively. In this control method, the human muscle strength for grasping is estimated through the myoelectrical signals of the human forearm collected by the MYO armband. A neural network is used for the recognition of human-object contact estimation. The assist-as-needed control is finally implemented to assist humans in grasping tasks. Experiment results on a soft robotic glove show the effectiveness of the proposed assistive control method.

AB Aiming at the optimization problem of minimizing the maximum completion time in job shop scheduling, a deep reinforcement learning optimization algorithm is proposed. First, a deep reinforcement learning scheduling environment is built based on the disjunctive graph model, and three channels of state characteristics are established. The action space consists of 20 designed combination scheduling rules. The reward function is designed based on the proportional relationship between the total work of the scheduled operation and the current maximum completion time. The deep convolutional neural network is used to construct action network and target network, and the state features are used as inputs to output the Q value of each action. Then, the action is selected by using the action validity exploration and exploitation strategy. Finally, the immediate reward is calculated and the scheduling environment is updated. Experiments are carried out using benchmark instances to verify the algorithm. The results show that it can balance solution quality and computation time effectively, and the trained agent has good generalization ability to the scheduling problem in the non-zero initial state.

AB A travelling thief problem (TTP) is a proxy to real-life problems such as postal collection. TTP comprises an entanglement of a travelling salesman problem (TSP) and a knapsack problem (KP) since items of KP are scattered over cities of TSP, and a thief has to visit cities to collect items. In TTP, city selection and item selection decisions need close coordination since the thief's travelling speed depends on the knapsack's weight and the order of visiting cities affects the order of item collection. Existing TTP solvers deal with city selection and item selection separately, keeping decisions for one type unchanged while dealing with the other type. This separation essentially means very poor coordination between two types of decision. In this paper, we first show that a simple local search based coordination approach does not work in TTP. Then, to address the aforementioned problems, we propose a human designed coordination heuristic that makes changes to collection plans during exploration of cyclic tours. We further propose another human designed coordination heuristic that explicitly exploits the cyclic tours in item selections during collection plan exploration. Lastly, we propose a machine learning based coordination heuristic that captures characteristics of the two human designed coordination heuristics. Our proposed coordination based approaches help our TTP solver significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art TTP solvers on a set of benchmark problems. Our solver is named Cooperation Coordination (CoCo) and its source code is available from https://github.com/majid75/CoCo.

AB Research in multi-objective particle swarm optimizers (MOPSOs) progresses by proposing one new MOPSO at a time. In spite of the commonalities among different MOPSOs, it is often unclear which algorithmic components are crucial for explaining the performance of a particular MOPSO design. Moreover, it is expected that different designs may perform best on different problem families and identifying a best overall MOPSO is a challenging task. We tackle this challenge here by: (1) proposing AutoMOPSO, a flexible algorithmic template for designing MOPSOs with a design space that can instantiate thousands of potential MOPSOs; and (2) searching for good-performing MOPSO designs given a family of training problems by means of an automatic configuration tool (irace). We apply this automatic design methodology to generate a MOPSO that significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art MOPSOs on four well-known bi-objective problem families. We also identify the key design choices and parameters of the winning MOPSO by means of ablation. AutoMOPSO is publicly available as part of the jMetal framework.

AB Machine learning (ML) is one of the core driving forces for the next breeding stage, and Breeding 4.0. Genotype matrix based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is often used in ML for genome-to-phenotype prediction. Genotype matrix has an inherent defect, as the feature spaces it generates across different individuals or groups are inconsistent, and this hinders the application of ML. To overcome the challenge, a genome descriptor, Genic SNPs Composition Tool (GSCtool) is developed, which counts the number of SNPs in each gene of the genome so the dimension of the feature vectors equals the number of annotated genes in a species. Compared to using the genotype matrix, using GSCtool significantly decreases the model training time and has a higher accuracy of phenotype prediction. GSCtool also achieves good performance in variety identification, which is useful in crop variety protection. In general, GSCtool will help facilitate the application and study of genomic ML. The source code and test data of GSCtool are freely available at https://github.com/SZJhacker/GSCtool and https://gitee.com/shenzijie/GSCtool.
   Genic single-nucleotide polymorphisms Composition Tool (GSCtool) is a novel descriptor that characterizes the genome. For genome-to-phenotype prediction, GSCtool outperforms genotype matrices, reducing model training time and enhancing accuracy. And it fills a gap in computational methods for variety classification. GSCtool facilitates the application and study of genomic machine learning.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB In the area of biometrics and document forensics, handwritten signatures are one of the most commonly accepted symbols. Thus, financial and commercial institutions usually use them to verify the identity of an individual. However, offline signature verification is still a challenging task due to the difficulties in discriminating the minute but significant details between genuine and skilled forged signatures. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel writer-independent offline signature verification approach using attention-based multiple siamese networks with primary representation guiding. The proposed multiple siamese networks regard the reference signature images, query signature images, and their corresponding inverse images as inputs. These images are fed to four weight-shared parallel branches, respectively. We present an efficient and reliable mutual attention module to discover prominent stroke information from both original and inverse branches. In each branch, feature maps of the first convolution are utilized to guide the combination with deeper features, named as primary representation guiding, which guides the model into concerning the shallow stroke information. The four branches are concatenated in an ordered way and are put into four contrastive pairs, which is helpful to obtain useful representations by comparing reference and query samples. Four contrastive pairs generate four preliminary decisions independently. Then, the eventual verification result is created based on the four preliminary decisions using a voting mechanism. In order to assess the performance of the proposed method, extensive experiments on four widely used public datasets are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in most cases and can be applied to various language scenarios.

AB Billions of costless near-field communication (NFC) sensor labels per day are demanded to practically enable edge computing between smartphones and everyday objects. However, to activate the billions of NFC sensor labels daily, providing an inexpensive manufacturing method for billions of wireless energy-harvesting labels (WeHL) per day will become a decisive issue for realizing the practical applications. Herein, a roll-to-roll (R2R) gravure, a typical high-throughput additive manufacturing method, is explored to print WeHLs where six diodes and six capacitors are integrated. To meet the high-throughput manufacturing speed (90 mm s-1) of the R2R gravure system, six different electronic inks are formulated to print the WeHLs to harvest +/- 10 V from the smartphone's NFC carrier. To attain a practical device yield under the given printing speed, the web tension, nip force, doctor blade angle, and overlay printing registration accuracy are well controlled and optimized to print six different layers within a high overlay printing accuracy, while printing patterns to connect two electrodes with a height difference greater than 3 mu m. The fully R2R-printed WeHLs can successfully harvest energy from the smartphone's NFC carrier with the conversion efficiency of 50%.
   Using a roll-to-roll (R2R)- gravure-printing system, fully R2R-printed energy-harvesting labels, integrated with six diodes and six filter capacitors, can harvest a bipolarized direct current +/- 10 V from the smartphone's near-field communication (NFC) carrier (13.56 MHz). Based on the 900 nm thickness of the printed PEDOT:PSS layer, the R2R gravure system can provide NFC energy-harvesting labels with a 66% yield.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB On-site inspection of invisible subsurface defects in multiscale structural materials by conventional nondestructive testing (NDT) methods, such as X-ray and ultrasound, requires complex sample preparation and data acquisition processes. Moreover, the inspected area is very small. Herein, a simple, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive NDT method for identifying and classifying the geometries of subsurface defects using commercial cameras, digital image correlation software, and object detection (OD) algorithms is developed. Three OD algorithms-Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), Mask R-CNN, and you-only-look-once (YOLO)v3-are evaluated for their ability to locate defects and identify defect geometries. Specifically, bounding boxes of two sizes (large and small) are applied to the regions of defect-induced perturbations in strain tensors, which serve as virtual representatives of invisible subsurface defects. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on test datasets of known and unknown defect types. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can effectively utilize the surface deformation field information to accurately and reliably locate and identify subsurface defects. The method is nondestructive and low cost, enables real-time detection, is robust against noise-dominated deformation fields, and can be applied to various structural deformations. The method is therefore suitable for multiscale structural health monitoring and characterization of internal defects in materials.
   A simple, cheap, and ultrasensitive nondestructive testing method for identifying the location and geometry of invisible internal defects in structures using deep learning and surface deformation field is developed and evaluated. The method is user-friendly and can be applied to a wide range of materials and deformations, without requiring knowledge of material properties or complex mathematical equations.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

DE Language models; Sentiment analysis; Key items; Interpretability
AB We study sentiment analysis task where the outcomes are mainly contributed by a few key elements of the inputs. Motivated by the two-streams hypothesis, we explore processing input items and their weights separately by developing a neural architecture, named TraceNet, to address this type of task. It not only learns discriminative representations for the target task via its encoders, but also traces key elements at the same time via its locators. In TraceNet, both encoders and locators are organized in a layer-wise manner, and a smoothness regularization is employed between adjacent encoder-locator combinations. Moreover, a sparsity constraint is enforced on locators for tracing purposes and items are proactively masked according to the item weights output by locators. A major advantage of TraceNet is that the outcomes are easier to understand, as it identifies the key components responsible for the outcomes, making them easier to understand. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in sentiment classification. Furthermore, we present case studies to showcase the interpretability of the model and conduct comprehensive analyses to highlight the impacts of each component. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel technology named fashion intelligence system, which quantifies ambiguous expressions unique to fashion, such as "casual,'' "adult-casual,'' and "office-casual,"was previously proposed to support users in their understanding of fashion. However, the existing visual-semantic embedding (VSE) model, which forms the basis of the system, does not support images that are composed of multiple parts, such as those containing hair, tops, trousers, skirts, and shoes. Therefore, we propose a partial VSE (PVSE) model, which enables fine-grained learning of each part of the fashion outfit. The proposed model learns embedded representations via angular-based contrastive learning. This helps in retaining three existing practical functionalities and further enables image-retrieval tasks where changes are only made to specified parts and image-reordering tasks focusing on the specified parts. In other words, the proposed model enables five types of practical functionalities, even with a simple structure. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to conventional models, without increasing computational complexity. (c) 2023 The Authors.

DE Meta-learning; Few-shot learning; Data discrepancy; Generalization
ID BATCH NORMALIZATION
AB Meta-learning becomes a promising way to solve the few-shot learning problem in recent research. This paradigm mainly relies on hierarchical architecture and episodic training to achieve good generalization on the new learning task. However, as we know, support and query sets in each training task in episodic training only contain a few data points. Too limited training data can lead to data discrepancy between the training and test data which further hurts the performance of learning models in classical supervised and semi-supervised learning. Hence, there is an interesting question: Can we also improve the meta-learning model in few-shot learning by aligning the data distributions of support and query sets? In this work, we try to answer this question. Firstly, we give a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of meta-learning to show that eliminating the data-distribution discrepancy between the support and query sets in each training task can improve the meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Next, we design an experiment to further verify our analysis. The experimental results show that aligning the data distributions is crucial and even can help the learning model trained by the classical batch-based training achieve better performance on unseen few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we also propose two simple meta-batch normalization methods following our result which can be integrated into recent meta-learning methods to improve their performance in few-shot learning.

AB The growth in social media has led to the increasing spread of unverified or false information. Automat-ically detecting rumours and accessing their veracity, i.e., false rumours, true rumours, or unverified rumours, is an important and challenging task in social media analytics. This paper aims to build an effective and scalable stream classification framework for early fine-grained rumour classification based on community response. We propose a Causal Diffused Graph-Transformer Network (CDGTN) to extract features from the source-reply graph in a social media conversation. Then, we propose Source-Guided Incremental Attention Pooling (SGIAP) to aggregate the encoded features with discrete timestamps. To improve the performance of early classification, we propose a Stacked Early Classification Loss (SecLoss), which aims to minimize the classification loss over the time instances. This can greatly improve the effectiveness of early classification of rumours. To improve the efficiency of streaming rumour verification, we propose a continued inference algorithm based on prefix-sum, which can greatly reduce the computational complexity of stream classification of rumours. Furthermore, we annotated the first Chinese rumour verification dataset, by extending the existing Chinese-Twitter dataset, namely CR-Twitter, originally for rumour detection. We conducted experiments on the Twitter15, Twitter16, PHEME, Weibo, and the extended CR-Twitter datasets for rumour classification, to verify our proposed stream classification framework. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can significantly boost the effectiveness and efficiency of early stream classification of rumours.

AB Synthetic data is essential for assessing clustering techniques, complementing and extending real data, and allowing for more complete coverage of a given problem's space. In turn, synthetic data generators have the potential of creating vast amounts of data - a crucial activity when real-world data is at premium - while providing a well-understood generation procedure and an interpretable instrument for methodically investigating cluster analysis algorithms. Here, we present Clugen, a modular procedure for synthetic data generation, capable of creating multidimensional clusters supported by line segments using arbitrary distributions. Clugen is open source, comprehensively unit tested and documented, and is available for the Python, R, Julia, and MATLAB/Octave ecosystems. We demonstrate that our proposal can produce rich and varied results in various dimensions, is fit for use in the assessment of clustering algorithms, and has the potential to be a widely used framework in diverse clustering-related research tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Current encoder-decoder-based methods achieve T-CAS often with a two-step approach where the information is passed between the encoder and decoder with a shared vector of reduced dimension, which, however, may result in information loss. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model to translate human neural activity to speech (ET-CAS) by introducing a dual-dual generative adversarial network (Dual-DualGAN) for cross-domain mapping between electroencephalogram (EEG) and speech signals. In this model, we bridge the EEG and speech signals by introducing transition signals which are obtained by cascading the corresponding EEG and speech signals in a certain proportion. We then learn the mappings between the speech/EEG signals and the transition signals. We also develop a new EEG dataset where the attention of the participants is detected before the EEG signals are recorded to ensure that the participants have good attention in listening to speech utterances. The proposed method can translate word-length and sentence-length sequences of neural activity to speech. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both words and sentences of auditory stimulus. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The study of time series forecasting is of great significance, particularly as accurate forecasting under long time-series is critical to data-driven decision-making. Although existing deep learning models (such as recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, time convolutional networks, and transformers) exhibit excellent forecasting performances, they do not consider the unique properties of time series, particularly the trend and seasonality. To address this issue, this study proposes a DFNet model with the following characteristics. (1) A three-branch decomposition method is designed to obtain the trend, seasonal, and irregular components, and the least squares method is adopted to correct the seasonal data and process different serial patterns separately to accurately obtain the internal regularity and periodicity, thereby improve model performance. (2) A segmented polynomial activation function is adopted to effectively handle problems associated with negative data loss and slow operation speed, and reduce the amount of model computation. (3) Based on the information fusion transfer mechanism, the extracted long-term dependencies are passed to each other and aggregated to enhance the coupling between sequences. Experiments on nine datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for long time-series prediction. The model showed a significantly superior prediction performance compared with existing prediction models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REPUTATION; CHALLENGES
AB In agent systems, cooperation plays a key role that can only be achieved trusting other agents. However, in many application areas of agents, the lack of enough frequent direct experiences is a major problem to find the right partner to cooperate with. The exchange of indirect information such as recommendations about third parties intends to address this problem. Since an increase of recommendation exchanges will produce more accuracy in trusting decisions, any way of promoting the exchange of recommendations would be welcome in order to extend the use of Trust models. In this paper, we present a method of exchanging recommendations to be used by such trusting agents which pursues an increase of cooperation (in the form of more recommendations exchanges). We used ART testbed domain as an illustrative example of application, where agents act as providers and consumers of painting appraisals, and we propose the pair of interacting agents to agree about a joint pair of reputation requests that would immediately satisfy both agents instead of expecting future benefits of sharing reputation in an altruistic way. We show under what circumstances (different parameter setups) an implementation of our proposal behaves better (in terms of quality and cost) compared to no-recommendations and the way recommendations take place in ART Testbed.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID UNIFIED FRAMEWORK; IMAGE
AB One-shot face reenactment aims to animate a source facial image into a different pose and expression provided by a driving image. Despite recent advancements showing promising results, challenges still exist in accurately transferring facial expressions and being robust to large-scale head movements. Additionally, the current method's lack of interpretability in the network's generalization remains a concern. We propose a novel and interpretable framework for one-shot face reenactment based on spatial-temporal reconstruction views to address these challenges. To achieve precise transfer of facial expressions and intuitive control over the generated images, we have opted for the powerful 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) as an immediate representation. Transferring motion parameters such as pose and expression from the driving image to the target face allows us to generate a 3D reconstructed face image that allows explicit control. To enhance the robustness of motion reconstruction, we introduce the concept of dense pseudo-temporal flow and propose a cross-modal cascade temporal motion reconstruction network to predict it. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the robustness of motion reconstruction, especially for large-scale head movements. In addition, to further improve the generated image quality, we propose the motionmodulative residual fusion block as the information path to transfer the motion information from the motion reconstruction network to the local texture reconstruction network. Finally, we discussed the generalization ability of our framework based on its interpretable generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate highly realistic facial images and can be comparable with state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   measure
AB Predicting the next item that users may engage in is a key task of recommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to deal with this task from different aspects. Theoretically, the proper ensemble of multiple different methods (a.k.a. base models) can make more accurate and stable recommendations. However, most of the existing ensemble methods rely on static aggregation strategies, which fail to capture base models' dynamic predictive abilities for each user over time. In addition, most of the existing diversity measures used in regression or classification ensemble methods rely on a distance metric of base models' outputs, which makes it intractably apply for next-item recommendation whose base models output sequential ranking lists. To solve the above problems, we propose a Sequential Ensemble Method, named SEM, to aggregate different base models for next-item recommendation. We assume users' concentration and base models' expertise can be inferred from users' sequential behaviors and base models' prediction results. Therefore, we propose to explicitly model base models' dynamic predictive abilities on different users over time based on users' concentration and base models' expertise. In addition, we propose a new diversity measure for sequential ranking ensemble, which can perform diversity-based learning over time for better performance of next-item recommendation. Extensive experiments on six real-world data sets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The self-attention mechanism is a feature processing mechanism for structured data in deep learning models. It has been widely used in transformer-based deep learning models and has demonstrated superior performance in various fields, such as machine translation, speech recognition, text-to-text conversion, and computer vision. The self-attention mechanism mainly focuses on the surface structure of structured data, but it also involves attention between basic data units and self-attention of basic data units in the deeper structure of the data. In this paper, we investigate the forward attention flow and backward gradient flow in the self-attention module of the transformer model based on the sequence-to-sequence data structure used in machine translation tasks. We found that this combination produces a "gradient distortion"phenomenon at the token level of basic data units. We consider this phenomenon a defect and propose a series of solutions to address it theoretically. Furthermore, we conduct experiments and select the most robust solution as the Unevenness-Reduced Self-Attention (URSA) module, which replaces the original self-attention module. The experimental results demonstrate that the "gradient distortion"phenomenon exists both theoretically and numerically, and the URSA module enables the self-attention mechanism to achieve consistent, stable, and effective optimization across different models, tasks, corpora, and evaluation metrics. The URSA module is both simple and highly portable.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID VISUAL NAVIGATION; AUTOENCODERS; INSTRUCTION
AB We present a new network whereby an agent navigates in the 3D environment to find a target object according to a language-based instruction. Such a task is challenging because the agent has to understand the instruction correctly and takes a series of actions to locate a target among others without colliding with obstacles. The essence of our proposed network consists of a coarse-to-fine fusion model to fuse language and vision and an autoencoder to encode visual information effectively. Then, an asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithm is used to coordinate detailed actions to complete the navigation task. Extensive evaluation using three different levels of the navigation task in the 3D Vizdoom environment suggests that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art. To see if the proposed network can deal with a real-world 3D environment for the navigation task, it is combined with Rec-BERT, which is based on REVERIE. The result suggests that it performs better, especially for unseen cases, and it is also useful to visualize what and when the agent pays attention to while it navigates in a complex indoor environment. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Virtual stain transfer is a promising area of research in Computational Pathology, which has a great potential to alleviate important limitations when applying deep-learning-based solutions such as lack of annotations and sensitivity to a domain shift. However, in the literature, the majority of virtual staining approaches are trained for a specific staining or stain combination, and their extension to unseen stainings requires the acquisition of additional data and training. In this paper, we propose HistoStarGAN, a unified framework that performs stain transfer between multiple stainings, stain normalisation and stain invariant segmentation, all in one inference of the model. We demonstrate the generalisation abilities of the proposed solution to perform diverse stain transfer and accurate stain invariant segmentation over numerous unseen stainings, which is the first such demonstration in the field. Moreover, the pre-trained HistoStarGAN model can serve as a synthetic data generator, which paves the way for the use of fully annotated synthetic image data to improve the training of deep learning-based algorithms. To illustrate the capabilities of our approach, as well as the potential risks in the microscopy domain, inspired by applications in natural images, we generated KidneyArtPathology, a fully annotated artificial image dataset for renal pathology.

AB This paper proposes two stochastic variance reduced gradient algorithms based on adaptive complex-valued limited-memory BFGS (ACL-BFGS) algorithm, which are established on the calculation of Wirtinger gradient for fully complex-valued dendritic neuron model (FCDNM). Basically, the explicit expression of Wirtinger gradient is derived to enable the quasi-Newton algorithm for the training of FCDNM. A stochastic variance reduction strategy is adopted such that the number of samples per batch is increased during the optimization process to ensure the effectiveness of the stochastic algorithm. The stochastic ACL-BFGS algorithm with variance reduction (SACL-BFGS) can be efficiently applied for the training of FCDNM. Furthermore, by generalizing the A3 accumulative multi-step quasi-Newton method, the A3-SACL-BFGS algorithm is presented to achieve fast convergence. The experimental results on some benchmark prediction and classification problems conclusively imply that the proposed SACL-BFGS and A3-SACL-BFGS algorithms for FCDNM are clearly superior to complex-valued backpropagation (CBP), CL-BFGS and ACL-BFGS algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Contrastive learning
AB In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs), as the state-of-the-art technology have advanced the solutions of recommender systems (RSs). However, the representations of nodes obtained from GNNbased models are always suboptimal when facing sparse interaction data. Contrastive learning on graphs has been proven to be effective in alleviating the influence of data sparsity. Most related works perform contrastive learning through self-discrimination. As there is extensive homophily among nodes in RSs, we consider it irrational to ignore the self-supervised signal from neighboring nodes, which is crucial for optimizing the embedding representation of nodes. To address these issues, we propose a model named enhanced contrastive learning with multiaspect information (ECMI) for RSs, which aims to capture the self-supervised signals from both the nodes themselves and their neighbors. Specifically, we conducted contrastive learning in a two-layer space separately. We consider structurally connected homophilic node pairs as positive samples in explicit space while introducing a social relationship network and an item entity network in implicit space. These two networks can be combined with the interaction network to conduct a two-channel training procedure. This procedure can build more effective contrastive learning by exploring the similar potential neighbors of nodes. We conduct experiments on four public datasets, and the results consistently validate the effectiveness of the ECMI.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Open-domain dialogue generation; Data filtering; Dialogue attributes
AB There is a growing interest in improving the conversational ability of models by filtering dialogue corpora. Previous filtering strategies rely on a scoring method to assess and discard samples from one perspective, enabling the model to enhance the corresponding dialogue attributes (e.g., consistency). However, the discarded samples may achieve high scores in other perspectives and can also provide regularization effects on the model learning. In this work, we propose a multi-view attribute-enhanced dialogue learning framework that can capture the attribute-related features steadily and comprehensively. Instead of filtering the raw dataset, our framework introduces adapters to learn knowledge from the attribute-related sub-sets after pre-training the model on the full dataset. Considering the variety of dialogue attributes, we further design a multi-view enhancement mechanism, including multiview selection and inter-view fusion. It groups the high-quality samples from multiple perspectives, respectively, and enhances different attributes of responses with the corresponding sub-sets and adapters, keeping knowledge independent and allowing flexible integration. Empirical results and analysis show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art data filtering methods significantly in terms of enhancing dialogue attributes and fusing view-specific knowledge.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are frequently utilized for transferring and delivering. Dual-or multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation schemes are required for heavy loads. In this work, focusing on the path planning for a dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, a unique artificial potential field-A*(APF-A*) algorithm is studied to fulfill the safe and effective cooperative suspension transport. APF-A* algorithm proposed the strategy of host-wingman cooperative transportation based on the APF theory, and optimizes the heuristic function by introducing the concept of repulsive force to maintain the quadrotor flying at a safe distance from the obstacle. In addition, APF-A* algorithm promises to increase search efficiency while identifying the optimal path, and it can reduce the swing angle motion of loads to enhance the security of transportation. The coordinated flight control and path planning of quadrotor UAVs are simulated in AirSim environment and tested in flight experiments. The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable to plan safe and reliable paths, meanwhile changing formation and avoid collision when the wingman is close to obstacles. In comparison to the regular A* algorithm, the APF-A* algorithm proposed in the paper performs better in path planning for dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, reducing the search time and the number of search grids by nearly 60% and 53.75%, respectively. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Cross-lingual; Entity alignment; Attribute triples; Bi-Neighborhood
   Graph Neural Network
AB The objective of the cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) task is to identify equivalent entities in knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages. Most existing works rely on relation triples to learn entity representations. In addition, some methods introduce attribute information to improve the performance of EA, but they model relation triples and attribute triples separately in different networks, which prevents the alignment information in different triples from spreading across the networks and limits their mutual interaction and enhancement. In this paper, we propose integrating entities and attributes into a unified entity-attribute graph, where the neighbors of an entity include not only other entities but also its attributes. To model the entity-attribute graph, we further design a novel Bi-Neighborhood Graph Neural Network (BNGNN). Specifically, BNGNN applies attribute-aware self-attention to neighborhood aggregation and generates two types of neighborhood features in each layer, i.e., entity neighborhood features and attribute neighborhood features. Then, the two features are combined through a highway gate to generate more representative entity embeddings. Finally, the outputs of multiple layers are integrated to obtain global-aware entity representations with high-level structural information. Furthermore, a two-stage training strategy is adopted to jointly perform entity alignment and attribute alignment in a semi-supervised framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets (regular and sparse) demonstrate that our BNGNN model consistently outperforms existing EA methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Content-based video moment retrieval; Weakly supervised; Low-rank prior
ID LOCALIZATION
AB Content-based video moment retrieval (CVMR) aims to localize a successive sequence of frames in an untrimmed reference video, called target moment, that is semantically corresponding to a given query video. Current state-of-the-art CVMR methods are mainly developed using frame-level annotation, which is often quite expensive to collect. In this paper, we aim to develop a weakly-supervised CVMR method, which uses coarse-grained video-level annotations during training. Under weak supervision, video localizers require more discriminative frame-level video features. To achieve this goal, we proposed a novel prior, termed low-rank prior, based on an observation that the frame-level feature of a video should have low-rank properties. We demonstrated that the low-rank features are more discriminative and are beneficial to accurately localize the action boundaries. To produce a low-rank feature, we designed a low-rank feature reconstruction (LFR) operator. A new differentiable matrix decomposition approach is proposed to generate the low-rank reconstruction of the input matrix, meanwhile ensuring that the matrix decomposition process is differentiable. Based on the LFR, we developed a new weakly-supervised CVMR model which produces low-rank video representation and performs semantic consistency measures to discover the semantically matched segment in the reference video to the query video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods consistently and even achieves competing performance to fully-supervised baselines.

DE Federated learning; Meta learning; One-off clustering; Decomposition and
   consolidation; mechanism
AB In traditional federated learning such as FedAvg, the associations among clients are often ignored when executing on non-independent or heterogeneously distributed datasets, resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy. Although some previous works on clustered federated learning have been proposed to address such problems, most of them have a polarized problem. When the number of clustering is small, the model performs poorly and fails to accurately capture the distinction between clients. While a large number of clustering times tends to lead to higher communication costs. Therefore, a critical need is to design an efficient clustered federated solution that can both better capture the diversity between local clients and minimize the communication and computation costs. To this end, we propose an efficient one-off clustered federated learning framework called FedEOC. FedEOC exploits the "learning-to-learn"characteristic of meta-learning to enhance the generalization of the model across different clients so that only a small number of iterations are needed for each client to quickly obtain locally adapted weights. Based on the well-initially trained weights on all clients, we can cluster the clients only once to achieve the effect of one-off clustering and multiple-round applying. Additionally, to alleviate the issue of cluster imbalance, FedEOC is equipped with a Decomposition and Consolidation (Dec-Con) mechanism to decompose the clients from the extreme clusters and consolidate them into the most similar ones. The comprehensive experiments conducted on two real -world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of FedEOC from both aspects of accuracy and efficiency.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Explainability is essential for users to effectively understand, trust, and manage powerful artificial intelligence solutions. Decision trees are one of the pioneer explanaible artificial intelligence algorithms widely used by experts in several contexts. C4.5 is a prominent decision tree that continues to serve as the base for subsequent improvements. One of main pillars on the decision tree induction is the split evaluation measure used for assesing the candidate splits. Usually, one single split evaluation measure is used during the induction procedure. However, combining multiple split evaluation measures into the induction procedure could improve the classification results. Our proposal aims to obtain better classification results by selecting the best candidate split taking advantage of the power of voting methods to aggregate the ranking issued by multiple split evaluation measures. Consequently, we performed a set of experiments to appraise the performance of our proposal on 114 databases. From these experiments, two novel split evaluation measures, proposed in this paper, were assessed against 11 individual and prominent state-of-the-art split evaluation measures. Our classification results show that our proposal outperforms the other state-of-the-art split evaluation measures.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have gained much attention due to their high effectiveness and efficiency in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, when solving MOPs, it is important but difficult to maintain a good balance of exploration and exploitation. In addition, some reference point based MOEAs with fixed reference points perform poorly on MOPs with irregular frontiers. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multistrategy multiobjective differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm, named RLMMDE. In RLMMDE, a multistrategy and multicrossover DE optimizer is utilized to alleviate the exploration and exploitation dilemma. An adaptive reference point activation mechanism based on RL is proposed to activate the adaptive adjustment of reference points. Moreover, a reference point adaptation method is proposed to improve the performance of RLMMDE on irregular frontier problems. Experimental results of RLMMDE tested on some benchmark test suites (i.e., ZDT, DTLZ, UF, WFG, and LSMOP) and two practical mixed-variable optimization problems show that the algorithm outperforms some advanced MOEAs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a complex neurocognitive disease and is the main cause of dementia. Although many studies have been proposed targeting at diagnosing dementia through spontaneous speech, there are still limitations. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, which propose multimodal methods, train separately language and acoustic models, employ majority-vote approaches, and concatenate the representations of the different modalities either at the input level, i.e., early fusion, or during training. Also, some of them employ self-attention layers, which calculate the dependencies between representations without considering the contextual information. In addition, no prior work has taken into consideration the model calibration. To address these limitations, we propose some new methods for detecting AD patients, which capture the intra- and cross-modal interactions. First, we convert the audio files into log-Mel spectrograms, their delta, and delta-delta and create in this way an image per audio file consisting of three channels. Next, we pass each transcript and image through BERT and DeiT models respectively. After that, context-based self-attention layers, selfattention layers with a gate model, and optimal transport domain adaptation methods are employed for capturing the intra- and inter-modal interactions. Finally, we exploit two methods for fusing the self and cross-attention features. For taking into account the model calibration, we apply label smoothing. We use both performance and calibration metrics. Experiments conducted on the ADReSS and ADReSSo Challenge datasets indicate the efficacy of our introduced approaches over existing research initiatives with our best performing model reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 91.25% and 91.06% respectively. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB External knowledge has been introduced into pretrained models to enhance answer reasoning in machine reading comprehension tasks. However, most methods directly take the retrieved knowledge as input without considering the reliability and applicability, which may induce information redundancy and generate noise. In this paper, we propose a confidence-based knowledge integration framework (CBKI) to enhance the pretrained model with the ability of active knowledge acquisition and identification. In particular, we introduce a confidence mechanism, which is composed of three modules, namely, confidence estimation, confidence perception and knowledge integration. Specifically, for the candidate knowledge retrieved from the external knowledge base, the confidence estimation module first calculates the probability score of the candidate knowledge effectiveness in answer prediction. Then, the confidence perception module determines whether the candidate knowledge should be adopted for semantic inference at the current step. Finally, the knowledge integration module evaluates how much information should be absorbed from the candidate knowledge and merges the knowledge into the model. Experimental results on standard datasets show that the proposed CBKI is superior to BERT with an increase of 4.08% in accuracy. Furthermore, the CBKI also shows great advantages in robustness and interpretability.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Context-aware recommendation; Recommender system; Graph neural network
AB Context-aware recommender systems (CARS), which capture user preferences by incorporating user interactions and side information, have attracted widespread attention in today's information age. With the emergence of graph convolution networks (GCN) in recent years, graph methods have been shown effective in establishing global connections between users, items, and contexts. In this paper, we first introduce a unified graph recommendation framework to incorporate both GCN and traditional models, showing the similarities and differences between them in terms of parameter configurations and message passing styles. Then, based on the empirical analysis of existing models, we propose a novel Fused Graph Context-aware Recommender system (FGCR) model to address the identified limitations. FGCR fuses the parameter configuration of both item-based models and GCN, modeling robust node relationships in user-item-context interaction graph through a sparse item correlation matrix and dense node embeddings. In addition, FGCR applies a novel masked graph convolution strategy to refine the information aggregation process with various types of nodes. Experiments conducted on five realworld datasets show that FGCR significantly improves performance compared to the seven baseline models. Ablation study and user group analysis validate the effectiveness of each component in FGCR, especially in modeling active users and sparse contextual information.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI CSAL: Cost sensitive active learning for multi-source drifting stream

AB Multi-source stream classification is a prominent real-world problem challenged by the limited real labels and non-stationary environment. Despite growing research achievements in this field, most existing works solved this problem by requiring all real labels of source or target streams to conduct domain adaption or transfer learning mechanisms, which brings high labeling costs. However, in real -world applications, there are usually insufficient labeled data in both source and target streams, and the annotation cost of the source and target streams are generally unequal. Thus, we propose a Cost-Sensitive Active Learning (CSAL) method for multi-source drifting streams. Specifically, a multi-source ensemble framework with an asymmetry weighting mechanism is presented to ensure beneficial knowledge transfer and avoid the negative transfer. Then, a multi-perspective similarity estimation method is proposed to evaluate the similarity of source and target streams. On this basis, a novel cost-sensitive hybrid labeling strategy that combines volatility strategy and uncertainty strategy with a cost-sensitive budget control mechanism is proposed, which adaptively selects representative samples at the appropriate time. At last, a parallel multiple hypothesis drift detection method is proposed, which can efficiently utilize real labels to detect concept drift. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data streams show that our CSAL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with even fewer labels.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) performance degrades when their training and test conditions or corpora differ. Cross-corpus SER (CCSER) is a research branch that discusses adapting an SER system to identify speech emotions on a corpus that has different recording conditions or language from the training corpus. For CCSER, adaption can be performed in the feature extraction module or emotion classifier, which are the two main components of the SER system. In this paper, we propose AFTL method (attention-based feature fusion along with transfer learning), including methods in both feature extraction and classification for CCSER. In the feature extraction part, we use Wav2Vec 2.0 transformer blocks and prosody features, and we propose an attention method for fusing them. In the classifier part, we use transfer learning for transferring the knowledge of a model trained on source emotional speech corpus to recognize emotions on a target corpus. We performed experiments on numerous speech emotional datasets as target corpora, where we used IEMOCAP as the source corpus. For instance, we achieve 92.45% accuracy on the EmoDB dataset, where we only use 20% of speakers for adapting the source model. In addition, for other target corpora, we obtained admissible results.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hic-KGQA: Improving multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph
   via hypergraph and inference chain
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Question answering over knowledge graph; Knowledge graph embedding;
   Hypergraph; Mutual information
AB Question answering over knowledge graph (KGQA) aims at answering natural language questions posed over knowledge graphs (KGs). Moreover, multi-hop KGQA requires reasoning across multiple triplets in KGs to get to the answer. Unfortunately, KGs often lack complete information and contain many missing links, which poses huge challenges for multi-hop KGQA. To address this, recent several approaches have introduced KG embedding techniques, which have shown good performance on the multi-hop KGQA task. However, these methods ignore the semantic correlations between paths and questions, and the reasoning process is not easily explained. Furthermore, traditional KG embedding methods consider only low-order pairwise relations and ignore the higher-order relations among entities, leading to a sub-optimal embedding result. To address these problems, we propose Hic-KGQA, a novel hypergraph and inference chain-based model for multi-hop KGQA. Specifically, Hic-KGQA first generates pre-trained entity embeddings with multiple semantics via a hypergraph-based KGC module (HKM). Then, an inference chain modeling module (ICMM) is designed to learn the importance of different inference chains for the question and encode the highest-ranked inference chain into an embedding representation. Finally, two scoring networks are used to evaluate the correlation between the candidate answers and the questions from the perspective of both the triplet facts and the reasoning process to obtain more accurate answers. Furthermore, the mutual information maximization (MIM) is innovatively implemented to capture richer common path features from similar cases to alleviate the missing path problem caused by KG incompleteness. Experiments show that Hic-KGQA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is explainable. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Scale-free networks are very common in real practice. The key to analyze scale-free networks is the statistical inference of degree distribution. However, one observed network only allows us to calculate network statistics such as nodal degree, but does not provide enough information for further inference such as constructing confidence intervals. Borrowing the spirit of bootstrap, by generating network samples as bootstrap samples, we are then able to quantify statistical accuracy of various network statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel network bootstrap method named 1-BNB where bootstrap samples are generated via 1-bit matrix completion. We focus on constructing confidence interval for network degree distribution. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of our newly propose method. A collaboration network among statisticians, a social network and an electrical grid network are studied for illustration purpose.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the low-rank matrix/tensor-based methods have attracted increasing attention for multi-dimensional multimedia data (e.g., image and video) recovery, which assumes the holistic data is low-rank. For most multimedia data, the low-rank assumption is usually violated due to their spatially diverse local similarity. The cube-based method, which breaks the holistic image into small local cubes with a fixed size, can alleviate this issue to some extent. However, cubes with a fixed size are not flexible to cover the regions of local similarity at different scales. Inspired by the superpixel, we suggest the size-adaptive super-tensor as the generic unit instead of the cube with the fixed spatial size, which allows us to flexibly exploit the local similarity at different scales. The super-tensor enjoys significant low-rankness and avoids excessive overlapped pixels as compared with cubes of fixed sizes. Empowering with the super-tensor, we propose a low-rank super-tensor approximation (LRSTA) model for multi-dimensional data recovery, which can fully exploit the local similarity and low-rankness at different scales. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments on multimedia data, including color images, multispectral images (MSIs), and videos, verify that the proposed method outperforms the other competing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-source vessel automatic identification system (AIS) data gathered in the maritime Internet of Things (IoT) system has diverse data characteristics, such as sparse satellite data and terrestrial receiver's limited coverage. However, it is challenging for the maritime IoT system to provide efficient and accurate intelligent trajectory prediction services while applying multi-source AIS data. Therefore, improving the adaptability and accuracy of vessel trajectory prediction methodologies adapted to varied AIS datasets is essential to enhancing marine traffic safety and transportation efficiency. This study proposes an adaptive data fusion (ADF) model based on multi-source AIS data for predicting vessel trajectories in maritime traffic. The same marine mobile service identifier (MMSI) and timestamp fuse the multi-source AIS data. Deep learning methods are employed to perform feature learning and increase adaptability. This study also utilizes adjacency distance to enhance the correlation between dataset trajectory trajectories. Finally, we validate the benefits of the ADF model using actual terrestrial and satellite AIS data along the west coast of the United States (US). Regarding average RMSE and MAE, the ADF model reduces the prediction error by 46.51% and 52.7% when fusing multi-source historical trajectories compared to current studies. Moreover, multiple ablation experiments have proved our model's superiority.

   classification
AB Few-shot Learning (FSL) is a challenging problem that aims to learn and generalize from limited examples. Recent works have adopted a combination of meta-learning and transfer learning strategies for FSL tasks. These methods perform pre-training and transfer the learned knowledge to metalearning. However, it remains unclear whether this transfer pattern is appropriate, and the objectives of the two learning strategies have not been explored. In addition, the inference of meta-learning in FSL relies on sample relations that require further consideration. In this paper, we uncover an overlooked discrepancy in learning objectives between pre-training and meta-learning strategies and propose a simple yet effective learning paradigm for the few-shot classification task. Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components: (i) Detach: We formulate an effective learning paradigm, Adaptive Meta-Transfer (A-MET), which adaptively eliminates undesired representations learned by pre-training to address the discrepancy. (ii) Unite: We propose a Global Similarity Compatibility Measure (GSCM) to jointly consider sample correlation at a global level for more consistent predictions. The proposed method is simple to implement without any complex components. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under more challenging scenarios with large domain differences between the base and novel classes and less support information available.

TI Self-adaptive oversampling method based on the complexity of minority

AB Learning from imbalanced datasets is a nontrivial task for supervised learning community. Traditional classifiers may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class when addressing imbalanced classification and the issues can become more deteriorated in the presence of other complicated aspects: overlapping, outliers and small disjuncts, etc. In this paper, we propose a selfadaptive oversampling algorithm based on the complexity of minority data for dealing with imbalanced datasets classification problems. In the proposed algorithm, various hyperspheres with different radii determined by imbalance ratio and the distances to the nearest enemy neighbors are firstly generated to cover all minority instances provided that they cannot contain any majority instance. Subsequently, the oversampling process is conducted only within these hyperspheres and thus the generated synthetic minority instances cannot intervene within the majority space, eventually avoiding overlapping issues during achieving between-class balance. In addition, a self-adaptive assignment strategy of oversampling sizes is developed based on the minority data complexity, where the hyperspheres with small radii and few instances in them are provided more chances to be oversampled. The strategy will favor addressing the outliers and small disjuncts issues since the hyperspheres covering the outliers and small disjuncts are usually of small sizes and contain few instances, which makes them have more chances to generate synthetic instances and thus eliminate within-class imbalance due to lack of density. Moreover, since the hyperspheres covering boundary minority instances are relatively small and thus are assigned with larger oversampling sizes, the proposed approach can also strengthen the boundary information of minority class, thus favoring the later learning tasks. The extensive experimental results on various simulated and real-world imbalanced datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art oversampling ones. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Green scheduling of manufacturing industry with energy saving as the core has been paid more and more attention in academia and industry. As a classic scheduling problem, hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem (HFSP) has been receiving increasing research attention. However, most studies only focus on time-related metrics while neglecting energy consumption. In this article, we studied energyefficient HFSP and assumed that machines can operate at different speeds. This is an assumption that has been rarely explored but can make the problem more relevant to real-world production. Moreover, the energy-efficient HFSP at a variable machine speed (EHFSP-VMS) was formulated as a multiobjective mathematical optimization model aiming to optimize make-span and total energy consumption simultaneously. As a landmark achievement in the field of multiobjective optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is adopted and improved as the solver, which is called fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE)-based NSGA-II (FCENSGA-II). Firstly, FCE, a fusion of fuzzy mathematics and information theory, is used to describe the difference and the FCE-based crowding distance is proposed for the first time. Its time complexity is lower than the original crowding distance. In addition, a machine learning strategy, namely opposition-based learning (OBL), is used to learn from opposite regions of the search space and increase the exploratory ability of the algorithm and the diversity of solutions. Finally, a critical path knowledge-based energy saving strategy (ESC) is adopted to discover non-dominant solutions by reducing the speed of machines on non-critical paths. A large number of experiments are conducted to test the performance of FCENSGA-II. The results show that in all test instances, the average, best and worst values of the solution obtained by FCENSGA-II are better than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms, and even the worst values obtained by FCENSGA-II in 75% of test instances are better than the best values of compared algorithms, which strongly confirms that FCENSGA-II outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms for solving EHFSP-VMS. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   reasoning; Rule learning
AB Reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs) is significant for downstream applications, such as question answering and information extraction. On the basis of using factual triples in KGs, learning logic rules has been explored to handle KG reasoning in an interpretable pattern. Some rule learning methods simply apply thresholds to reduce the exponential complexity caused by the vast candidate rules derived from KGs. Others are designed to prune candidates on the basis of embedding facts in the KG. However, these methods only consider the factual triples, which mainly contain structural information, and ignore sufficient semantic information in real-world KGs. This situation weakens the methods in searching for high-quality rules. To this end, we propose a joint method by incorporating logic rules with textual representations for interpretable KG reasoning, named LoTus. Firstly, LoTus obtains the structural embeddings with only factual triples, and the textual embeddings with descriptions of entities, which are later integrated into the representations of entities and relations. Secondly, top candidate rules are selected by a proposed joint pruning strategy incorporating structural and textual representations in KGs. Finally, LoTus captures high-quality rules and removes low-quality ones by a filtering process with metrics of rules. It reduces the time complexity on KG reasoning by learning rules and provides interpretability simultaneously. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that LoTus obtains competitive performance comparing to baselines on KG reasoning metrics Hits@1, Hits@10 and mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and achieves significant superiority among the recent rule learning methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Static-dynamic global graph representation for pedestrian trajectory

DE Trajectory prediction; Social interaction; Global graph representation
ID BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Effectively understanding social interactions among pedestrians plays a significant role in accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Previous works used either distance-based or data-driven methods to model interactions. However, the distance-based method has difficulty modeling complex interactions and ignores interactive pedestrians that are beyond a certain distance. The data-driven method models interactions among all pedestrians in a scene and introduces noninteractive pedestrians into the model due to the lack of proper supervision. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel global graph representation, which considers the spatial distance (from near to far) and the motion state (from static to dynamic), to explicitly model the social interactions among pedestrians. The global graph representation consists of two subgraphs: the static and the dynamic graph representations, where the static graph considers only the nearby pedestrians within a certain distance threshold, and the dynamic graph considers the interactive pedestrians that will likely collide soon. The proposed graph representation explicitly models the interaction by incorporating both the static (location) and dynamic states (velocity) in a distance-based manner. Then, based on the global graph representation, a novel data driven graph encoding network is proposed to extract the interaction features. It adopts two independent LSTMs and an attention module to encode the interaction feature from the perspective of the ego-pedestrian. Finally, the proposed prediction method is evaluated on two benchmark pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets, and comparisons are made with the state-of-the-arts.

AB Multivariate time-series is complex and uncertain. The overall temporal patterns change dynamically over time, and each feature is often observed to have a unique pattern. Therefore, it is challenging to model a framework that can flexibly learn feature-specific unique patterns as well as dynamically changing temporal patterns simultaneously. We propose a general framework for FEature-Aware multivariate Time-series representation learning, called FEAT. Unlike previous methods that only focus on training the overall temporal dependencies, we focus on training feature-specific as well as feature agnostic representations in a data-driven manner. Specifically, we introduce a feature-wise encoder to explicitly model the feature-specific information and design an element-wise gating layer that learns the influence of feature-specific patterns per dataset in general. FEAT outperforms the benchmark models in average accuracy on 29 UEA multivariate time-series classification datasets and in MSE and MAE on four multivariate time-series forecasting datasets.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, the issue of stability and stabilization for semi-Markov jump memristive neural networks (SMJMNNs) with stochastic quantized sampled-data control (QSDC) law is addressed. Firstly, a memristive neural network (MNN) model with mixed semi-Markov jump is established in the framework of the three independent Markov chains. Then, a stochastic QSDC scheme is proposed, in which semi-Markov jump parameters (SMJPs) in the gain matrices, quantization parameters and system connection weight matrices are different from each other. On the other hand, since signal transmission may be delayed, the influence of transmission delay is considered in the proposed stochastic QSDC scheme. Based on the above, a more general weak infinitesimal operator about the three semi-Markov processes (SMPs) is first given to deal with stochastic Lyapunov functionals (LFs). To reduce the conservatism of the obtained results, stochastic LFs about the two-sided closed-loop functions are constructed in the framework of the sampling patterns 6(tk) to 6(t) and 6(t) to 6(tk+1). Then, based on the novel constructed LFs, stochastic stability criterion for SMJMNNs is established by combining with stochastic QSDC law. Finally, the numerical simulation examples are provided to verify the validity and less conservatism of the obtained theoretical results.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   processing
AB Due to the large fluctuations of the boundaries and internal variations of the lesion regions in medical image segmentation, current methods may have difficulty capturing sufficient global contexts effectively to deal with these inherent challenges, which may lead to a problem of segmented discrete masks undermining the performance of segmentation. Although self-attention can be implemented to capture long-distance dependencies between pixels, it has the disadvantage of computational complexity and the global contexts extracted by self-attention are still insufficient. To this end, the authors propose the GFRNet, which resorts to the idea of low-rank matrix factorization by forming global contexts locally to obtain global contexts that are totally different from contexts extracted by self-attention. The authors effectively integrate the different global contexts extract by self-attention and low-rank matrix factorization to extract versatile global contexts. Also, to recover the spatial contexts lost during the matrix factorization process and enhance boundary contexts, the authors propose the Modified Matrix Decomposition module which employ depth-wise separable convolution and spatial augmentation in the low-rank matrix factorization process. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets showing that GFRNet performs better than the relevant CNN and transformer-based recipes.

   editing; CLIP; Diffusion model
AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has long dominated the field of image reconstruction and editing. It is capable to train a generator in an adversarial way, which can fool the discriminator and enable the generated image to be of high quality. However, this approach is often difficult to train, and the final result is hard to converge. Each different style of image requires construction of different datasets and complex optimization functions, and the training process is uncertain. To solve this problem, we propose a realistic image reconstruction and editing method based on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE-RAE), where the diffusion model converts Gaussian noise to real photos by iterative denoising. What we only need to do is to construct simple loss functions in the reconstruction process to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and we propose a novel semantic enhancement CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) to interfere with the SDE parameter optimization direction in the editing process. Simple text is needed to achieve unique image editing. Our method generates high-quality images that retain the texture and contour features of the original image. Specifically, we manipulate the initial image, perturb the image by adding random noise, and then iteratively denoise the image by reverse SDE, manipulating the image's RGB pixels to achieve image reconstruction and editing.

AB Dimension reduction is one of the most sought-after strategies to cope with high-dimensional ever-expanding datasets. To address this, a novel deep-learning architecture has been designed with multiple deconstruction and single reconstruction layers for non-negative matrix factorization aimed at low-rank approximation. This design ensures that the reconstructed input matrix has a unique pair of factor matrices. The two-stage approach, namely, pretraining and stacking, aids in the robustness of the architecture. The sigmoid function has been adjusted in such a way that fulfils the non-negativity criteria and also helps to alleviate the data-loss problem. Xavier initialization technique aids in the solution of the exploding or vanishing gradient problem. The objective function involves regularizer that ensures the best possible approximation of the input matrix. The superior performance of MDSR-NMF, over six well-known dimension reduction methods, has been demonstrated extensively using five datasets for classification and clustering. Computational complexity and convergence analysis have also been presented to establish the model.

ID GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK; DATA AUGMENTATION
AB Imbalanced image datasets consist of image datasets where there is a significant disparity in the number of samples across different classes. With imbalanced image datasets, learning algorithms often tend to be biased toward the majority class samples. This leads to poor classification of minority class samples as their training is not properly conducted. It becomes more complicated when the number of samples in the minority class is very low. In this paper, a novel hierarchical algorithm is proposed for generating new data using Capsule Generative Adversarial Networks (CapsGAN) to address the class imbalance problem in imbalanced image datasets. Unlike common GAN models, the proposed method incorporates an auxiliary CapsNet to identify high-value images in both minority and majority classes. This identification is based on the ability to detect complex relationships between low-level and high-level features present in capsule networks. Furthermore, the proposed CapsGAN model is conditioned to generate minority class samples based on feature vectors of last capsule layer to achieve a more balanced image dataset. For evaluating the performance of the proposed model, an image dataset called CICS was collected and introduced. Extensive experiments were also conducted using various online image datasets from different domains, with varying numbers of classes and data sizes. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model can generate high-quality samples in cases where the image dataset or the number of minority class samples is relatively small. Furthermore, the proposed model has maintained an accuracy of over 80% in an imbalanced ratio of 1:60.
   In this paper, a new hierarchical algorithm for data augmentation using Capsule Generative Adversarial Networks (CapsGAN) is proposed to solve the class imbalance problem in imbalanced image sets. The proposed algorithm uses an auxiliary capsule network to recognize high value images in minority and majority classes. Furthermore, the proposed CapsGAN model is conditioned to generate minority class samples with the purpose of balancing the dataset. Also, a suitable dataset for imbalanced models called CICS (Cracks In Concrete Structures) was collected and introduced.image

ID ALGORITHM
AB Recently, multi-view subspace clustering has attracted intensive attentions due to the remarkable clustering performance by extracting abundant complementary information from multi-view data, making its clustering performance much better than that of single view data. However, at present, multi-view subspace clustering methods develop either a shared consistency representation that models the common properties from all views, or a series of specificity representations each of which mines the intrinsic difference in each view, or global spatial structure of all features, or local geometric structure of multiple features. More seriously, only one kind of information is extracted and utilized in some research work. In this paper, to cope with the issue, we present a multiple kinds of information extraction method (MKIE) for multi-view subspace clustering, which combines the consistency and specificity regularizations with the graph regularizations. We construct some graph structures for the shared consistency representation and all the specificity representations, which model the local geometric structures of multiple features. The model of MKIE makes full use of four kinds of valid information: global spatial structure information, local geometric structure information, consistent feature information and specific feature information. In addition, we design an effective optimization algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Extensive experiments performed on four benchmark multi-view datasets validate the effectiveness of MKIE which is compared with ten state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.

AB A fastIMM-extended Viterbi (fastIMM-EV) algorithm-based maneuvering target tracking method is proposed for the real-time tracking of ground maneuvering targets by a ballistic acoustic array, which firstly adopts the extended Viterbi interactive multi-model (IMM-EV) algorithm to select the best model from a given model set to match the maneuvering target motion pattern; secondly, the alpha-beta filter and alpha-beta-gamma filter are used to replace the 2D or 3D Kalman filter in the traditional IMM algorithm, respectively, to form the fastIMM-EV algorithm, which nearly improves the algorithm efficiency, and at the same time, for the switching problem of different fastIMM-EV modules, a target maneuver recognition parameter is defined as the switching factor of the fastIMM-EV module, so that fastIMM-EV to switch the module when the target maneuver occurs; finally, the MATLAB simulation test results verify the practicality and high efficiency of the algorithm in this paper compared with different IMM target tracking methods.

AB Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) is a widely used dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction method. When the data has multiple connected components, the LE method has two obvious deficiencies. First, it might reconstruct each component as a single point, resulting in loss of information within the component. Second, it only focuses on local features but ignores the location information between components, which might cause the reconstructed components to overlap or to completely change their relative positions. To solve these two problems, this article first modifies the optimization objective of the LE method, by characterizing the relative positions between components of data with the similarity between high-density core points, and then solves the optimization problem by using a gradient descent method to avoid the over-compression of data points in the same connected component. A series of experiments on synthetic data and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Intelligent monitoring of machine chips can help the machine tool to remove chip accumulation in time. Based on chip shape information, real-time monitoring of the machine tool is also possible. Although image segmentation algorithms have been widely used in industry, they still need to improve. These methods still have some limitations in effectively combining global and local information of industrial images, and there needs to be an image segmentation algorithm specifically for machine tool chips. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm for lightweight chip image segmentation named Hybridformer. First, the algorithm generates scale-aware semantic features using feature maps of different scales as the input part. Then, we use the cross specification and SelfNorm to improve the generalization robustness of the model in terms of distribution bias. Finally, the network extracts global contextual information fusing EfficientNetv2 features to achieve accurate localization. Widespread experimental results show that Hybridformer outperforms both CNN and Transformer algorithms in terms of comprehensive performance on multiple chip image datasets, and it can achieve a good balance between accuracy and size of parameters.

AB It is a crucial basis to improve the performance of neural network by constructing an appropriate activation function. This paper proposes a novel modulation window radial basis function neural network (MW-RBFNN) with an adjustable activation function. In this MW-RBFNN, a raised cosine radial basis function (RC-RBF) is adaptively modulated by an exponential function, and served as a shape-tunable activation function of MW-RBFNN. Compared with the basic RC-RBF neural network, the approximating ability of MW-RBFNN is improved due to its shape-tunable activation function. Besides, the computation of MW-RBFNN is far less than that of Gaussian radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) because the MW-RBFNN is compactly supported. The training algorithm of MW-RBFNN is provided and its approximating ability is proved. Moreover, the regulation mechanism of the modulation index for the NN's performance is proved and the regulating algorithm of the modulation index in MW-RBFNN is given. The computational complexity of MW-RBFNN is also analyzed. Five typical application cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this proposed MW-RBFNN.

ID ENERGY-EFFICIENT; SELECTION APPROACH; COLONY ALGORITHM; WSN
AB Efficient energy consumption and quality of service (QoS) are two major problems in wireless sensor network (WSN). Because of lacking access to sensor nodes, one of the main challenges in WSN is efficient energy consumption that prolongs the life time of network. While finding the shortest path for data transition in WSN in terms of energy consumption, the QoS of the path has to be taken care of carefully. The main continuation of this paper is to find an efficient path in WSN that will reduce the energy consumption, while retaining a minimum level of QoS. To this end, a fuzzy constrained shortest path (FCSP) problem is formulated as energy consumption and the QoS cannot be measured precisely because of environmental conditions. In this paper, while providing shortest path in WSN, end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, jitter, and latency are considered as the QoS parameters. For FCSP problem, a recursive relation is defined to design a dynamic algorithm using the distance function to compare fuzzy constrained paths. We perform an evaluation of our approach through two simulations on WSNs. The obtained results show outperformance of our approach while providing effective solution in terms of energy consumption and QoS.

   Attention mechanism
AB Surface defect detection is a key link in the production process of industrial products. However, it is still challenging to realize automatic detection due to the low contrast between the defect and background, the random spatial positions and shapes of defects, and the imbalance between positive and negative samples. Although convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to defect detection, current CNN-based methods are still unable to cope with the above challenges because of the insufficient global representation ability, small receptive field, and difficulty in capturing tiny targets. To address these problems, this paper proposes a global receptive attention network (GRA-Net) for surface defect detection. This deep learning system introduces a backbone network combining CNN and transformers for feature extraction, so defects with low contrast can be identified. Then, a multi-level receptive field module is designed to achieve the overall perception for complex and changeable surface defects. Furthermore, a feature interaction attention module is developed to maximize the utilization of the comparatively few defect pixels. Finally, the defect boundary is refined by an adaptive boundary refinement block. Semantic segmentation experiments are conducted based on three datasets. The results show that the mean intersection-over-union and pixel accuracy of GRA-Net are 4-7 % and 2-5 % higher than the existing models, respectively.

AB Due to the great uncertainty and complexity in the underground environment, precious risk perception in underground construction is a highly challenging problem. Excessive false-positive alarms (FPA) and false-negative alarms (FNA) generated by the unreasonable setting of early-warning values are the main causes to affect the safety of engineering in underground construction. Aiming to reduce the FPA and FNA in risk assessment of an excavation procedure, this paper provides a novel data-driven optimization framework for early-warning threshold modification based on massive field monitoring data. The multi-objective expected value optimiza-tion (MEVO) approach is applied to achieve the goal of unsupervised and multivariate modification tasks. Firstly, the objective functions of the MEVO approach are established with the combination of grey relational analysis and Cosine similarity measure. Secondly, the expected values of objective functions are calculated based on the expert evaluation method and Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the sample sequence generated from observed monitoring data satisfying the expected values is selected as the optimal solution. A case study is utilized to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach. The result from the case study indicates that: (1) The proposed approach modifies the multivariate early-warning values to decrease the number of alarms with a reduction ratio of 12% in the training set; (2) The early-warning frequency under the modified values is lower than that under the original values during the whole excavation stages in the testing set; (3) The modified threshold values fall within the threshold intervals based on expert evaluation method, which are capable of improving risk assessment in current practice. In short, our proposed approach enables a more accurate and intelligent evaluation of the risk state by formulating more credible criteria. It contributes to serving as a reliable decision tool for ensuring construction safety during deep excavation.

AB In order to analyze the unknown accumulation delay relationship between the given inputs and outputs, one basic model and four extended models are proposed to simulate the different accumulation delay processes. The basic model called grey dynamic trend relational analysis model calculates the similarity between two sequences based on their trends. On the basis of the basic model, four extended models are developed to simulate the different accumulation delay effects. Two types of the accumulation delay effects, called driven-type and yieldedtype accumulation delay effects, are put forward for different time-delay relationships. Each type of the accumulation delay effects designs two weight distributions for analyzing the different time-delay processes. Two optimization models based on grid-search are given to determine the lag parameters in the four extended models. The pseudo-codes of intelligent algorithms are provided for the optimization problems. To explain how it can be employed in practice, the new approaches for the time-delay systems are applied to analyze the relationships between the air pollution and its driven factors and results in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The comparing results show that the novel models can handle the time-delay systems with accumulation delay effects and can determine the delay processes.

AB The introduction of trust-based approaches in social scenarios modeled as multi-agent systems (MAS) has been recognized as a valid solution to improve the effectiveness of these communities. In fact, they make interactions taking place in social scenarios much fruitful as possible, limiting or even avoiding malicious or fraudulent behaviors, including collusion. This is also the case of multi-layered neural networks (NN), which can face limited, incomplete, misleading, controversial or noisy datasets, produced by untrustworthy agents. Many strategies to deal with malicious agents in social networks have been proposed in the literature. One of the most effective is represented by Eigentrust, often adopted as a benchmark. It can be seen as a variation of PageRank, an algorithm for determining result rankings used by search engines like Google. Moreover, Eigentrust can also be viewed as a linear neural network whose architecture is represented by the graph of Web pages. A major drawback of Eigentrust is that it uses some additional information about agents that can be a priori considered particularly trustworthy, rewarding them in terms of reputation, while the non pre-trusted agents are penalized. In this paper, we propose a different strategy to detect malicious agents which does not modify the real reputation values of the honest ones. We introduce a measure of effectiveness when computing reputation in presence of malicious agents. Moreover, we define a metric of error useful to quantitatively determine how much an algorithm for the identification of malicious agents modifies the reputation scores of the honest ones. We have performed an experimental campaign of mathematical simulations on a dynamic multi-agent environment. The obtained results show that our method is more effective than Eigentrust in determining reputation values, presenting an error which is about a thousand times lower than the error produced by Eigentrust on medium-sized social networks.

AB Due to the improvement in power demand usage, the system causes more stress. Suitable placement of FACTS is introduced to improve power flows, stability, and power system security. An advanced optimal method has been introduced to resolve optimal power flow under various conditions. Five varied FACTS devices were positioned inside the power system to improve system safety at the least cost. Selecting the suitable location and size of FACTS device enabling high security and less cost was proposed using RSA. The objective functions were mitigated based on the RSA's inspiration to improve system security. The placement of the FACTS compensator was based on objective functions like LOSI, voltage deviation, real power loss, investment cost, sensitivity index, fuel costs, and constraints. The proposed model was validated under three conditions, namely generator outage, line outage, and both outage in IEEE 118 and IEEE 30 bus-systems. In the IEEE 30 bus system, TCSC provides better security of 1.4 severity at normal conditions and 1.3 severity in contingency conditions. In the IEEE 118 bus system, UPFC has less severity of 2.4 at normal conditions, and STATCOM has the least severity of 3 at contingency conditions. The proposed model provides enhanced security in all circumstances and reduces overall costs.

AB Monocular vision system is widely used in many fields due to its simple structure, faster speed, and lower cost for object measurement. However, most of the current monocular methods have complicated mathematical models or require artificial markers to achieve accurate measurement results. In addition, it is not easy to precisely extract the features of objects in the captured image which are affected by many factors. In this paper, we present a semantic-aware monocular projection model for accurate pose measurement. Our mathematical model is simple and neat, and we use deep learning network to extract the semantic features in images. Finally, the relevant parameters of the projection model are further optimized with Kalman filter to make the measurement results more accurate and stable. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is robust with high performance and accuracy. As a few constraints are required on the measured object and environment, our method is easy for installation.

   DESIGN
AB Order acceptance and scheduling (OAS) is a critical part of production planning in manufacturing units. In real-world problems, where the manufacturing units are required to meet capacity limitations and delivery time obligations, OAS problem arises. In this study, a hybrid population-based heuristic of imperialists competitive algorithm (ICA) and well-known simulated annealing (SA) has been applied to deal with the variant of OAS with time windows and sequence-dependent setup time. As part of ICA, a specific representation has been proposed to capture all of the characteristics of an OAS solution. The neighborhood functions have been developed based on this specific representation. In order to improve conventional ICA, a roulette wheel is used for selecting these functions, which is periodically updated based on their prior effectiveness. As an additional approach to avoid being confined to a local optimum point, an escape strategy is employed. This part of the study utilizes eight local search functions that are different from those in the ICA in order to further diversify the population. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on benchmark instances, and results have been analyzed. The results of our experiments demonstrated that ICA-SA shows improvement over well-known existing methods both in terms of quality and speed. In addition, we found in 32 out of 1500 cases, ICA-SA yielded a better result than the upper bound generated by MILP. This improvement in optimal solutions was made possible due to the allowance of scheduling tasks with zero revenue in this study. Therefore by relaxing one of the constraints of MILP, better upper bounds can be achieved.

ID CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
AB Fitness landscape analysis (FLA) is used to mathematically characterize optimization problems. It is critical to get appropriate sampling points using random walk (RW) algorithms to perform FLA on continuous optimization problems. However, most of the existing approaches face the problems of poor robustness of the RW algorithm and inadequate coverage of the fitness landscape. In this study, an incremental random walk (IRW) algorithm is proposed to sample the fitness landscape for continuous optimization problems. IRW includes two major improvements: (i) An incremental perturbation mechanism is proposed to generate perturbation variables to enhance the diverse distribution of sampling points. (ii) The problem of getting trapped in the local region is alleviated by using the mirrored boundary handling method. The experimental results tested on various cases demonstrate the excellence of IRW in terms of coverage. Moreover, IRW has shown superior reliability at different problem dimensions on other different benchmark functions. Consequently, IRW is well-suited as an alternative for sampling continuous fitness landscapes under a variety of problem dimensions.

ID CLOSED-FORM SOLUTION
AB Representation learning (RL) methods learn objects' latent embeddings where information is preserved by distance. Since certain distance functions are invariant to certain linear transformations, one may obtain different embeddings while preserving the same information. In dynamic systems, a temporal difference in embeddings may be explained by the stability of the system or by the misalignment of embeddings due to arbitrary transformations. This study focuses on the embedding alignment problem to distinguish structural changes inherent to a system from arbitrary changes caused by representation learning methods, and quantify their magnitudes. In order to avoid any confusion due to the naming conventions in the literature, it should be noted that embedding alignment problems are different from graph matching/network alignment problems. In the representation learning literature, although the embedding alignment issue has been acknowledged, its measurement and empirical analysis have not received sufficient interest. In this work, we explore the embedding alignment and its parts, propose novel metrics to measure alignment and stability, and show their suitability through synthetic experiments. Real-world experiments show that both static and dynamic RL methods are prone to produce misaligned embeddings and such misalignment worsens the performance of dynamic network inference tasks. By ensuring alignment, the prediction accuracy raises by up to 90% in static and up to 40% in dynamic RL methods.

AB Considering the multiple fault scenario, i.e., both actuator and sensor faults occur simultaneously, this paper develops a neuro-dynamic programming (NDP)-based fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme for a class of nonlinear systems. By combining a descriptor observer with an adaptive observer, system states and multiple faults are estimated simultaneously. For the nominal system, i.e., the fault-free system, a critic neural network (NN) is employed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and the approximate optimal control policy is obtained. To eliminate the influence of sensor faults, the accurate estimations of system states are used instead of system states from faulty sensors to construct the approximate optimal control policy. Then, by combining the estimations of actuator faults with the approximate optimal control policy, an FTC law is developed to suppress the influence of actuator faults. The stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is analyzed to be uniformly ultimately bounded via the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the present FTC scheme is demonstrated by two simulation examples.

AB In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely applied in various fields, and its vulnerability to adversarial samples, which is inherited from deep learning, has also received considerable attention for training robust DRL agents. However, most of existing attack approaches aim to perturb the observations of DRL agents, and poisoning attacks against DRL through perturbing the reward from the environment have been studied less. In this paper, we propose a novel reward poisoning adversarial attack method that employs the exploration strategy of reinforcement learning to help effectively attack a target. The adversary first builds a deep neural network to attain the exploration value of each state-action pair, i.e., the E-value, which is utilized to determine the appropriate time to attack the target and the sign of adversarial perturbation to generate adversary samples to the reward. The experimental results demonstrate that the reward poisoning attack algorithm based on E-values proposed in this paper enables an adversary to improve the efficiency of attacks with fewer adversarial samples.

TI Ensemble anomaly score for video anomaly detection using denoise

ID CONSISTENCY
AB Video anomaly detection is a crucial task that aims to differentiate between normal and abnormal events. The current mainstream approach involves constructing an anomaly score based on the reconstruction error from a prediction model trained on normal frame sequences. However, this approach is limited by its deterministic nature, which may cause the anomaly score to be sensitive to underlying noise in the video. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an ensemble anomaly score constructed using a series of stochastic reconstructions of the original prediction. Specifically, we introduce the denoise diffusion model as a perturbation-denoise tool. First, the original prediction undergoes a perturbation process through a diffusion process. Then, a denoise diffusion model trained on normal predictions is used to directly reconstruct a series of noise-free predictions from the perturbed versions with different noise levels. Finally, an ensemble of all the reconstruction errors is used to provide a more generic and regularized anomaly score. Furthermore, we introduce motion filters into the detection pipeline to improve the modeling accuracy of the image distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on public datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in detecting performance under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.

AB Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings, which is a valuable yet challenging task. The main challenge is that there are ambiguous semantic biases in the camouflaged object datasets, which affect the results of COD. To address this challenge, we design a counter-factual intervention network (CINet) to mitigate the influences of ambiguous semantic biases and obtain accurate COD. Specifically, our CINet consists of three key modules, i.e., texture-aware interaction module (TIM), context-aware fusion module (CFM), and counterfactual intervention module (CIM). The TIM is designed to extract the refined textures for accurate localization, the CFM is proposed to fuse the multi-scale contextual features to enhance the detection performance, and the CIM is presented to learn more effective textures and make unbiased predictions. Unlike most existing COD methods that directly capture contextual features through the final loss function, we develop a counterfactual intervention strategy to learn more effective contextual textures. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CINet significantly outperforms 31 state-of-the-art methods.

ID ATTENTION
AB The primary goal of aspect-based sentiment analysis is to identify sentiment polarity concerning the given aspect in a sentence. Recent investigations have demonstrated the superior performance of graph convolutional neural network (GCN) on dependency parsing tree. However, these GCN-based models fail to take the given aspect into account when calculating the hidden node representation vector, as well as lack exploration of contextual commonsense knowledge. On the contrary, the gating mechanism enables the interaction of the context and the given aspect to enhance the impact of the given aspect on the context. Nevertheless, such interactions are frequently inadequate resulting in insufficient extraction of sentiment information. This paper proposes a dualgated graph convolutional network via contextual affective knowledge (DGGCN) to address these issues. The core idea is to incorporate GCN into the gating mechanism to enhance GCN to fully aggregate node information while strengthening the concentration on the given aspect. Simultaneously, the incorporation of contextual affective knowledge into graph networks can refine the perception of affective features. Experimental findings on five benchmark datasets reveal that our proposed DGGCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

DE Cybersecurity; Insider threat; Image representations; Multi-level
   wavelet decomposition; Capsule network; Classification
AB The detection of insider threats is a significant challenge for many organizations due to the complexities of the data, the potential for changes in user behavior, and limited ground truth. Current techniques for detecting insider threats, including balancing datasets, anomaly detection, and image classification, have challenges such as lower precision and a high False Positive Rate (FPR). This is due to complex and heterogeneous data and the disregard of the spatial arrangement and relationships between features in image classification techniques that are essential to understanding the detailed behavior pattern of a user. To address these issues, a novel image based insider threat detection framework is proposed, which integrates Multi-level Wavelet decomposition into a Capsule Network (MWCapsNet). The image generator for tabular data (IGTD) framework is used to generate image representations by identifying the correlation between the features which depict user behavior. The multi-level wavelet decomposition helps extract spectral and spatial features, whereas the capsule network captures contextual relationships between features from the generated image representations. Thus, improving the accuracy and precision of the MWCapsNet model with much lower false alarms. The proposed MWCapsNet model outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving 98.88% accuracy and 99.21% precision with a lower rate of false positives when evaluated using the CERT insider threat datasets.

AB Abnormal event detection is a critical component of intelligent surveillance systems, focusing on identifying abnormal objects or unusual human behaviours in video sequences. However, conventional methods struggle due to the scarcity of labelled data. Existing solutions typically train on normal data, establish boundaries for regular events, and identify outliers during testing. These approaches are often inadequate as they do not efficiently leverage the geometry and image texture information, and they lack a specific focus on different types of abnormal events. This paper introduces a novel two-stream fusion algorithm for abnormal event detection to address these diverse abnormal events better. We first extract the object, pose, and optical flow features. Then, the object and pose information is combined early on to eliminate occluded pose graphs. The trusted pose graphs are fed into a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) to detect abnormal behaviours. Simultaneously, we propose a video prediction framework that identifies abnormal frames by measuring the difference between predicted and ground truth frames. Lastly, we execute a decision-level fusion between the classification and prediction streams to achieve the final results. Our results on the UCSD PED1 dataset indicate the enhanced performance of the fusion model for various abnormal events. Furthermore, experimental results on the UCSD PED2 dataset and the ShanghaiTech campus dataset underscore our approach's effectiveness compared to other related works.

DE Multi -event prediction; Knowledge graph; Dynamic graph embedding
AB Predicting multiple concurrent events has a remarkable effect on understanding social dynamics and acting in advance to reduce damage. (1) From the perspective of spatial connection, trans-regional implication, which means the cause of the incident is not local but somewhere else, is an important reason for the occurrence of events. However, existing works neglect to model this spatial influence and only leverage the local information for event prediction. (2) From the perspective of temporal connection, future events are triggered by the continuous evolution of the region. Nonetheless, most studies assign events to different timestamps and recognize their sequential patterns, ignoring the continuity of the evolution process. To tackle the above two problems, we propose a spatial and temporal knowledge graph neural network (STKGN). Specifically, to construct the cross-regional connection, we propose a novel spatial-temporal event graph, where each region is denoted as a node and trans-regional influences are reflected by bidirectional edges. To simulate the continuously evolving process, we propose an event-driven memory network to represent the state of each entity and continually update the state embeddings by emerging events. Then we use a broadcast network to spread the local changes in the graph to obtain high-order reasons like the trans-regional implication. Extensive experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate that STKGN achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis shows the interpretability of the trans-regional implication.

AB Map matching has been widely used in various indoor localization technologies. However, conventional map matching technologies based on probabilistic models, such as particle filter (PF), still have a series of limitations, such as underutilization of map information, poor generalization, and relatively low precision. To improve the performance of PF-based map matching technique, this paper proposes MapDem, a novel map matching model fusing dynamic word embeddings and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to improve matching performance significantly. The key to our approach is to extract map information using dynamic word embeddings to represent each reachable point on the map as word vectors with allowable oriented trajectory information. The same point has different representations on different trajectories so that MapDem can adaptively learn the contextual information of map for position estimation. Unlike traditional particle filters, MapDem focuses on the learning of particle sets distribution by a statistical model, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), followed by estimating position with combined current and previous sequence information. Extensive experiments have been conducted with 610 trajectories in three real-world scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate the adaptability of MapDem which works equally well in all three different scenarios, outperforming traditional particle filters by 18% on average.

AB Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (RSIs) plays a significant role in many areas such as agriculture, environmental protection, and the military. However, since the difference in imaging mode and image complexity between RSIs and natural scene images (NSIs), it is difficult to achieve remarkable results by directly extending the saliency method targeting NSIs to RSIs. Besides, we note that the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based U-Net cannot effectively acquire the global long-range dependency, and the Transformer doesn't adequately characterize the spatial local details of each patch. Therefore, to conduct salient object detection in RSIs, we propose a novel two-branch architecture based network for Aggregating the Transformers and CNNs, namely ATC-Net, where the local spatial details and the global semantic information are fused into the final high-quality saliency map. Specifically, our saliency model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture including two parallel encoder branches and a decoder. Firstly, the two parallel encoder branches extract global and local features by using Transformer and CNNs, respectively. Then, the decoder employs a series of featureenhanced fusion (FF) modules to aggregate multi-level global and local features by interactive guidance and enhance the fused feature via attention mechanism. Finally, the decoder deploys the read out (RO) module to fuse the aggregated feature of FF module and the low-level CNN feature, steering the feature to focus more on spatial local details. Extensive experiments are performed on two public optical RSIs datasets, and the results show that our saliency model consistently outperforms 30 state-of-the-art methods.

AB Nowadays, k-means remains arguably the most popular clustering algorithm (Jain, 2010; Vouros et al., 2021). Two of its main properties are simplicity and speed in practice. Here, our main claim is that the average number of iterations k-means takes to converge (& tau;) is in fact very informative. We find this to be particularly interesting because & tau; is always known when applying k-means but has never been, to our knowledge, used in the data analysis process. By experimenting with Gaussian clusters, we show that & tau; is related to the structure of a data set under study. Data sets containing Gaussian clusters have a much lower & tau; than those containing uniformly random data. In fact, we go considerably further and demonstrate a pattern of inverse correlation between & tau; and the clustering quality. We illustrate the importance of our findings through two practical applications. First, we describe the cases in which & tau; can be effectively used to identify irrelevant features present in a given data set or be used to improve the results of existing feature selection algorithms. Second, we show that there is a strong relationship between & tau; and the number of clusters in a data set, and that this relationship can be used to find the true number of clusters it contains.

AB This paper investigates the fuzzy approximation-based optimal consensus control problem for nonlinear multi agent systems with unknown perturbations. By constructing local error dynamics, the considered optimal consensus problem is reformulated as finding Nash-equilibrium solutions to zero-sum games. Then, by using sliding mode control technology and the concept of hierarchical design, a series of control signals are sequentially designed to regulate the consensus error and minimize the local value function. In addition, an identifier critic architecture is developed by using generalized fuzzy hyperbolic models, where the identifier is employed to relax the requirement for complete system dynamics information, and the hierarchical sliding mode surface based critic network is applied to approximate optimal control inputs. Finally, A simulation example is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.

AB Nowadays, machine learning techniques are employed in a wide range of applications, where classification is a common task in machine learning. It predicts the class label of a previously unseen example according to the decision of a classification model, which is learned by running a classifier learning algorithm on the collected training examples set. On the other hand, in many practical applications, the collected training sets are usually class imbalanced, that is, one class can have significantly more examples than the other class(es), but the mi-nority class usually carries much valuable information and is more important than the majority class. However, most classifier learning algorithms are designed under the assumption that each class in a training set has approximately the same number of examples, leading to the consequence that they often can not achieve satisfactory classification performance on imbalanced data especially for the minority class examples. To solve this problem, a Radial-Based Undersampling approach with Adaptive undersampling Ratio (RBU-AR) is proposed in this paper. The main novelty of RBU-AR is that it attempts to determine the proper undersampling ratio ac-cording to the class overlap data complexity rather than adopting the default value 1 or using the empirical trial and error strategy as many existing undersampling approaches do. Experiments are conducted on 30 benchmark imbalanced datasets and 10 artificial datasets, the obtained results and corresponding statistical tests indicate that class overlap degree indeed has a great influence on the achievable classification performance and is usually more important than the class imbalance ratio IR, and our undersampling approach RBU-AR generally achieves highly competitive or better performance with respect to several state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, this work provides a theoretical guideline in determining the proper extent of undersampling by utilizing the class overlap data complexity information.

AB Dynamic ensemble selection (DES) systems work by estimating the level of competence of each classifier from a pool of classifiers and selecting the most competent ones for the classification of a given test instance during inference time. The majority of dynamic ensemble selection (DES) methods evaluate the competence of classifiers using the K-Nearest Neighbors to the unknown query sample. However, KNN is very sensitive to local data distribution and needs to store all data in memory. Moreover, it performs several computations for each individual query sample. Thus, relying on the KNN technique hampers the use of DES approaches for largescale problems and situations where data distributions are non-uniform. This article introduces a novel DES framework called FH-DES, which employs fuzzy hyperboxes to generate a competence map or incompetence map for each classifier. The competence map is generated from correctly classified samples to indicate the competence level of the classifier at each data point in the feature space, whereas the incompetence map, which shows regions where the classifier has low accuracy, is generated from misclassified samples. In this way, we can assess the competence or incompetence level of the classifier just by using the map without having to process previous samples. This feature results in a more accurate dynamic selection system with lower computational complexity compared to other dynamic selection methods. Moreover, we introduce several hyperbox expansion and contraction strategies that add incremental learning capability to the framework while keeping the computational cost low. Experimental results demonstrate that FH-DES achieves high classification accuracy with lower complexity than state-of-the-art dynamic selection methods. The source code for FH-DES is available at https://github.com/redavtalab/FH-DES.

AB Asset pricing via machine learning provides a promising way to capture price trends by fusing heterogeneous market factors to analyze their joint impact on stock movements rather than relying on statistical and econometric models in finance to explore the causality between a market indicator and stock returns. However, the fusion nature of machine learning also hides the way to unveil the internal mechanism of stock movements. In this study, a deep learning framework with visual clues is presented to unveil the entangled factors and their function on stock movements. In particular, a context-aware hierarchical attention mechanism (CHARM) is first proposed to encode unstructured textual media information to trace the literal power of news on such media-aware stock movements. The encoded media and other structured market factors are further fused via tensor-based learning to infer and visualize their interactions on stock fluctuations. Last, a pre-estimating method for locating turning points as trading clues is utilized to improve the efficiency of each investment opportunity. Experiments conducted in real securities markets demonstrate the proposed framework not only improve the readability of the investing strategies, but also enhance the predictive accuracy and the investing returns comparing with the state-of-the-art models, including AZFinText, TeSIA, eLSTM, CMT, MAC and SA-DLSTM.

AB Neurons are the fundamental units of neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method for explaining neural networks by visualizing the learning process of neurons. For a trained neural network, the proposed method obtains the features learned by each neuron and displays the features in a human-understandable form. The features learned by different neurons are combined to analyze the working mechanism of different neural network models. The method is applicable to neural networks without requiring any changes to the architectures of the models. In this study, we apply the proposed method to both Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm. We conduct experiments on models for image classification tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Through these experiments, we gain insights into the working mechanisms of various neural network architectures and evaluate neural network interpretability from diverse perspectives.

AB The query-based object detection models are improvement of transformer. Using the learnable query, they complete the transition from traditional dense detection to sparse detection. However, such models have the weaknesses of slow convergence speed, poor adaptability to target changes, and additional networks. The CycMixer proposed in this paper uses multi-scale granule cluster sampling for encoding, avoiding a large number of parameters brought by the explicit structure. It adopts the cycle mixing module to improve the adaptability and increase the receptive field to cope with the change in detection targets by means of adaptive channel sampling and cycle spatial sampling. Firstly, the query extracted by backbone is decoupled into content vector and positional vector. Then the multi-head attention mechanism generates offsets. Secondly, the multi -scale feature map obtained by backbone and the transformed position enter the multi-scale granule cluster sampling stage. The stage consists of multi-scale feature space generation and granule cluster sampling. In addition, offsets and original positional vectors are converted to a new positional vector, which is decoded to get the bounding box. Finally, the content vector and the sampled matrix enter the cycle mixing. Cycle mixing consists of adaptive channel mixing and cycle spatial mixing. The mixed content vector is updated by the post feed-forward network (FFN) to receive a new content vector. Another FFN outputs the predicted categories. Compared with the existing detectors, the AP of our method on MS COCO dataset can reach 44.0 in 12 epochs and 46.0 in 36 epochs of training, which has obvious advantages in the convergence speed and the simplicity of the model. Experimental results on the cityscapes dataset also demonstrated the superiority of the method.

In this context, this study proposes, an IoT-based decision support system for the analysis of Covid-related data in healthcare systems. Through in-vehicle monitoring, it is intended to safely send important data and patient updates to attending physicians. The suggested approach uses feature extraction methods to identify patients' crucial states while protecting their private information. To improve feature extraction, two techniques are combined: ensemble classification and cipher substitution for secure Json Web Tokens (JWTs). By incorporating the Secure Hashing Algorithm-2 (SHA-2) methods into the Feature Extraction based Logistic Regression (FELR), security protections are substantially reinforced. The system uses the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to provide secure communication between devices and access to the extracted characteristics from rescue vehicles. The system analyzes passengers, traffic data, and medical issues, which are continually updated with cloud-based security, by using vehicle-based communication networks. The secure movement of patient data inside the hospital network is ensured by this cloud-based system. By using sophisticated regression analysis and ensemble learning approaches, our suggested methodology has shown significant advantages compared to traditional models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Mixed Regression (MR). Our technique demonstrates exceptional performance with an accuracy rate of 96%, a recall rate of 91%, and an F-measure of 91%. We also precisely compared the performance of our proposed FELR algorithm with hybrid prediction model using deep learning, the extra tree convolutional neural network-based ensemble model, ensemble-based random forest, ensemble transformation learning, and machine learning with regression. Significantly, FELR algorithm has demonstrated exceptional superiority by consistently surpassing the predictive capabilities of all these algorithms. The system has exceptional performance and exhibits improved efficiency and secure transmission capabilities. The unique model that we propose offers a feasible and effective approach for detecting crucial states in patients within healthcare facilities. The success of our framework is shown via a well-planned approach that includes important processes such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, ensemble model construction, and evaluation. The proposed framework offers a promising avenue for aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding the critical health trajectories of COVID-19 patients.

AB Accurate service demand forecasts at critical facilities are fundamental for efficiently managing resources and promptly providing essential services to people and community. However, it has received little attention in the literature, mainly due to the unavailability of granular data and the lack of sophisticated forecasting methods. To address this gap, we provide a new perspective on sensing service demands at critical facilities leveraging fine-grained human mobility data, and propose a novel data-driven framework to forecast mobility patterns at the neighborhood level. Specifically, we develop a two-stage forecasting scheme to manage large-scale and complex human movement information. The first stage is to decompose the large-scale mobility data into spatial and temporal patterns, whereas the second stage is to model complex temporal dynamics using multivariate time series analysis. The proposed framework is implemented using real human mobility data obtained from mobile phone users. The results show that our model demonstrates the best predictive performance for varying forecast horizons, when compared to multiple benchmark methods including traditionally-used statistical and deep learning models. We also performed model robustness checks, showing that the proposed model is robust in making short-term and long-term forecasts. The proposed predictive framework could help businesses and local governments accurately forecast service demands for critical facilities for better allocating their resources.

AB Recommendation systems are widely used to filter massive information. However, they often face the challenges of cold start and sparsity problems, limiting their effectiveness. Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which focuses on predicting the relative order of user items, has been conventionally proposed to address these challenges for ranking-based recommendation systems. However, conventional BPR approaches rely solely on implicit feedback and lack semantic and visual sentiment information. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal BPR method that incorporates both semantic and visual sentiment to capture more nuanced user preferences and provide more accurate recommendations. Experimental evaluations show that the performance of our proposed method across seven metrics outperforms conventional BPR in both the review-rich and image-rich scenarios, indicating the potential and significance of considering sentiment for improving the performance of BPR recommendation systems.

   architecture; Image generation; Image classification
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their ultra-high-speed and ultra-low-power operation, rendering them suitable for a range of energy-efficient applications. However, their performance in image generation is relatively mediocre, resulting in a lack of an effective generative replay mechanism to handle sequential probabilistic representations of multiple datasets. Consequently, this limitation often leads to catastrophic forgetting. This paper introduces a novel SNN lifelong learning framework namely Dynamic Lifelong learning with Spiking Generative Networks (DL-SGN), aimed at providing better generation ability while mitigating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning scenario. DL-SGN comprises three key components: dynamic experts, a student, and an assistant. The dynamic expert is imple-mented as a dynamically expanding mixture model, with a proposed network expansion mechanism Dynamic Knowledge Adversarial Fusion (DKAF) facilitating the automatic handling of an increasing number of tasks. the student module adopts an SNN-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and classifier, leveraging accumulated knowledge from each expert. To enhance the student's ability to generalize to images, we introduce a discriminator as an assistant module trained using adversarial training. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed by conducting experiments on image generation and classification in a lifelong learning environment, and the results substantiate the effectiveness of DL-SGN.

AB 3D object detection is a key task in environmental awareness, which plays a vital role in autonomous driving safety. Lidars and cameras are widely used sensors that provide complementary information for accurate 3D detection. However, due to the domain difference between the two modalities, it is challenging to leverage their respective strengths and fuse them perfectly. In this paper, an end-to-end detector termed BF3D is proposed, which integrates with the semantic sampling module, geometric point-image mapping module, and bi-directional attention fusion module. Specifically, the semantic sampling module incorporates a novel downsampling strategy to preserve more foreground points and pixels. Additionally, the geometric point-image mapping module is developed to find geometric correlation pixels of the point and take advantage of the high density of image features. We also introduce a bi-directional attention fusion module to combine useful information from the two modalities by attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BF3D outperforms both single-and multi-modal 3D detectors. Codes are available at: https://github.com/hustzyj/BF3D.

DE GNSS; Multipath; NLOS; Deep learning
AB Multipath and non-light-of-sight (NLOS) reception greatly deteriorate the GNSS positioning accuracy in urban areas. Currently, most of the attempts using machine learning in this area focus on signal status prediction (LOS, multipath, NLOS). This paper exploits the capability of deep learning in multipath/NLOS mitigation. A new input feature, the single-differenced residual map is proposed, which has a high correlation with the user location and is very effective in multipath/NLOS mitigation. Combining the domain knowledge in GNSS, features of residual maps from different satellites are extracted by the proposed network and generate the heat map to indicate the user location. The proposed network can significantly improve the positioning accuracy of 84% of the epochs in the dense urban to 5-meter level. In addition, our network has a superior generalization ability, reducing the error of 90% of the epochs to 7 m level in a new scenario.

DE Transformers; Insect pest classification; Efficient-self-attention;

AB Transformers with long-range dependency and data specificity act as an effective means of classifying insect pests in agricultural engineering. Although many methods have been proposed to confine the range of self-attention within a local region to reduce the computation complexity, none of them can reduce the number of model parameters. Moreover, the self-attention mechanism usually causes query tokens to focus excessively on image patches, which limits the effective receptive field and the long-range dependence. To address these issues, this paper establishes a novel Dilated-Windows-based Vision Transformer with Efficient-Suppressive-self-attention (DWViT-ES) architecture, which includes efficient-self-attention (ESA), dilated window (DW), and suppressive-self-attention (SSA) as its core components. The ESA simplifies the successive linear Trans-formations to reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs. Meanwhile, the DW and SSA expand the effective receptive field of self-attention mechanism to prevent query tokens from focusing on similar and close regions, thereby preventing the loss of useful information. Finally, experiments show that the DWViT-ES only has 19.6 M parameters and 3.5G FLOPs (over 20% reductions vs. 19.6 M and 4.5G of Swin-T). Meanwhile, the DWViT-ES training from scratch has 71.6% top-1 accuracy on the IP102 dataset (2.4% absolute improvement of Swin-T); after fine-tuning on Imagenet-1K, the DWViT-ES achieves 76.0% and 78.7% top-1 accuracy on IP102 and CPB (0.1% and 0.9% absolute improvement of Swin-T), respectively. Meanwhile, practical deployment on a mobile-embedded device is presented, which validates the feasibility of the DWViT-ES.

AB Knowledge graphs, which contains billions of facts, have become a useful resource for many AI-related downstream tasks, such as knowledge inference, personalized search. However, although existing knowledge graphs contain billions of facts, most knowledge graphs are still incomplete due to the inability to manually access all the facts in the world. In order to automatically predict missing triples, researchers have proposed many knowledge graph embedding models for link prediction task. However, most existing models have flaws in handling symmetric relations, as they will get the same constant |r| = 1 or r = 0 for any symmetric relations. In order to address such flaws, we propose a novel model called InversEF, which can get different representations for symmetric relations by learning inverse function representation of triples. In InversEF, for the complex relations, we explicitly capture the structured information of each entity by using the interaction between entities , relations. Due to the symmetry between the function and its corresponding inverse function, InverseEF can work well on the symmetric and inverse relations. Experimental results show that, InversEF achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

ID FUZZY RELIABILITY
AB Since uncertainty and ambiguity are common in real-world problems, numerous methods based on different kinds of fuzzy sets have been widely used in the evaluation of system reliability over the years. However, these methods are unable to deal with conflict uncertainty, particularly when it comes to the uncertain failure rates of the system's components. This paper introduces the idea of the triangular conflicting bifuzzy set (TCBFS), which is a novel paradigm for dealing with conflicting uncertainty. A novel method is devised to determine the membership and non-membership functions for the system's reliability when subsystems/components exhibit conflicting bifuzzy failure rates. In order to generate the membership and non-membership functions for various system configurations, including series, parallel, series-parallel, and parallel-series systems, non-linear programming is used to derive a number of functions based on conflicting bifuzzy numbers. The validity of the suggested method in modeling and evaluating system reliability with different conflicting bifuzzy failure rates is demonstrated through illustrated scenarios. This novel approach improves the precision and resilience of reliability estimations for systems by providing a more precise representation of uncertainties.

AB This article introduces CHR++, an implementation of CHR (Constraint Handling Rules) in C++. CHR++ has been designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and to make it easier to model problems of NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time) complexity class thanks to the support of don't know non-determinism. CHR++ conforms to the refined semantics of CHR and provides a high-level syntax similar to the historical CHR implementations in Prolog. It is a powerful system that incorporates many of the high-level optimisations known to date. Like implementations made on top of Prolog, it handles don't know non-determinism through support for the CHR proves proves extension. CHR++ is the first non-Prolog CHR system that natively supports don't know non-determinism. It makes it easier to model constrained decision or optimisation problems and shows a significant gain in efficiency compared with CHR Prolog systems. It equals or exceeds the fastest CHR systems in Java and C, but is able to tackle a whole class of problems unattainable by those systems.

   action segmentation; Multimodal data fusion; Imbalanced data
AB Completing continuous circular capsulorhexis (CCC) requires the operator to perform fine operations, which is difficult to do accurately when continuous fine actions are out of balance in the classification of CCC procedures. Multimodal deep learning can improve the classifier's performance, but the recognition accuracy of inferior classes is difficult to improve. To solve these problems, a bidirect-gate recurrent unit (Bi-GRU)-attention-based multimodal, multi-timescale data fusion network (BiMNet) is proposed, which contains a data extraction module called a skip-concatenate gate recurrent unit (SC-GRU), a bimodal data fusion attention computation, and a decoder module. The combination of these modules can fully extract the features of different temporal scales in multimodal action data and fuse them effectively. The model is validated using the ophthalmologist CCC multimodal maneuver dataset, which was collected by the data collection platform constructed in this research, achieving an accuracy of 0.9124 +/- 0.0125 in continuous action sequence segmentation and improving the F1-score of minority class recognition to over 80%, making it more effective than baseline algorithms.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest designing and interacting technology used to support organizations in the competitive electronic commerce (E-commerce) context. The studies on AI in E-commerce remain fragmentary since few papers review the evolutionary process of knowledge infrastructure. To bridge this gap, we constructed a conceptual framework from the resource orchestration perspective, and retrieved 2252 documents from the Web of Science (WoS) database dating from 1998 to 2022 to synthesize the extant research on AI in E-commerce. Specifically, we integrated main path analysis with science mapping analysis covering the strategic diagram and evolution map. Through qualitative analysis of critical nodes in main paths, this article found that knowledge disseminated around recommender systems (RSs). This article also examined the performance traits and inter-relationships of significant themes over three consecutive time zones, as well as identified four main AI-enabled outcomes (thematic areas): Optimization and decision support, Trust and personalized recommendation, Sentiment analysis, and AI theories with allied technologies. Potential research prospects and implications are proposed based on these findings. Overall, this article provides state-of-the-art information on how AI can facilitate the implementation of E-commerce operations and could serve as a stepping stone to newcomers in the scientific community.

AB Hierarchical binary classifiers are often used for multiclass problems when the number of classes is significantly more. The hierarchical structure suffers from a decrease in detection probability when there is an increase in the number of layers and classes. The order and the choice of classifier used in individual blocks of the hierarchical structure affect the overall probability of detection. In this paper, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed to optimize the order of the classifier block at each level. It is also proposed to assign a suitable classifier model for the individual classifier block at each level to maximize the overall probability of detection. The proposed techniques also use an Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) classifier model (weighted average of the constructed classifier) as an alternative approach instead of fixing one classifier model at each classifier block and optimizing the classifier block's order using ACO. The description using the probability of false negative (miss-* pM), and the probability of false positive (false alarm-* pF) gives the characteristics of the individual classifier blocks in the hierarchical structure. Monte carlo simulation is performed by randomly assigning values for pM and pF. It was found that the overall detection rate is consistently increasing using the proposed method for various attempts made in the Monte carlo simulation. The performance of the optimized binary hierarchical structures obtained using the proposed technique for the Engine vibration data with 42 classes and 53 block classifiers are compared with the default hierarchical structure. It was observed that there has been a significant improvement in the overall detection rate from 87.235% using the default structure (with Random forest ensemble to classify all classes in the hierarchy) to 90.92% using the proposed technique (ACO with Adaboost). The proposed technique can be used for applications that demand hierarchical, multi-level classifications.

AB This article presents a reconfiguration strategy for the corrective controller achieving model matching control of an input/state asynchronous sequential machine (ASM). The considered controller is vulnerable to permanent faults that degenerate a subset of the controller's states. If the controller has a certain amount of redundancy in terms of its states, one can build a reconfiguration scheme in which the functionality of degenerated states is taken over by supplementary states. The proposed reconfiguration scheme is superior to conventional methods of fault tolerance with hardware redundancy since the required number of redundant states is much smaller. Hardware experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits are provided to validate the applicability of the proposed scheme. The present study serves as the first research report on the reconfigurable corrective controller.

TI Fast Prediction for Criminal Suspects through Neighbor Mutual
   Information-Based Latent Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

ID GRAPH
AB One of the interesting characteristics of crime data is that criminal cases are often interrelated. Criminal acts may be similar, and similar incidents may occur consecutively by the same offender or by the same criminal group. Among many machine learning algorithms, network-based approaches are well-suited to reflect these associative characteristics. Applying machine learning to criminal networks composed of cases and their associates can predict potential suspects. This narrows the scope of an investigation, saving time and cost. However, inference from criminal networks is not straightforward as it requires being able to process complex information entangled with case-to-case, person-to-person, and case-to-person connections. Besides, being useful at a crime scene requires urgency. However, predictions from network-based machine learning algorithms are generally slow when the data is large and complex in structure. These limitations are an immediate barrier to any practical use of the criminal network geared by machine learning. In this study, we propose a criminal network-based suspect prediction framework. The network we designed has a unique structure, such as a sandwich panel, in which one side is a network of crime cases and the other side is a network of people such as victims, criminals, and witnesses. The two networks are connected by relationships between the case and the persons involved in the case. The proposed method is then further developed into a fast inference algorithm for large-scale criminal networks. Experiments on benchmark data showed that the fast inference algorithm significantly reduced execution time while still being competitive in performance comparisons of the original algorithm and other existing approaches. Based on actual crime data provided by the Korean National Police, several examples of how the proposed method is applied are shown.

AB In this work, we empirically study debiased Visual Question Answering (VQA) works with Adapters. Most VQA debiasing works sacrifice in-distribution (ID) performance for the sake of out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Hence, we explore and experiment with the use of adapters to preserve the ID performance by training only a simple adapter network to debias and recreate performance. We conduct an extensive empirical study on recent well-established VQA debiasing works and show that the entirety of the debiasing information from the proposed debiasing methods can be captured and modelled using a single fully connected layer while preserving original network performance by skipping the adapters. Through our exploration, we find that different placements of adapters are required for different debiasing techniques and show the different possibilities of using adapters for debiasing through our experiments. We believe our findings in this work open up more questions to be asked and explored for the VQA community.

AB Transfer learning (TL) has made great progress in intelligent fault diagnosis of bearing. However, due to the harsh working conditions of bearings in engineering practice, in addition to the bearing vibration signals, sensors also inevitably collect noise signals, which leads to the performance degradation of TL. In this paper, a novel model based on TL is proposed to solve the problem. Different from previous studies, an adaptive input length model instead of a fixed input length is established to diagnose bearings with different parameters. A signal processing method combining wide kernels in the first convolutional layer and pooling layer is used to feature denoise the input. Group convolutional and instance normalization based on 1D-CNN are constructed for feature extraction, health conditions classification, and denoise. An optimization objective function based on maximum mean discrepancy is introduced to align the feature distribution discrepancy. The model does not rely on any bearing data label information and realizes unsupervised TL. In the meanwhile, seven experiments including TL model and anti-noise model are conducted to compare and analyze the performance of intelligent fault diagnosis. Experimented on the axlebox bearing dataset of High-speed train, the accuracy is 85.98%, 93.62%, and 99.82% under SNR equal-6 dB,-4 dB, and-2 dB respectively. Experimented between bearing in electromechanical drive systems and high-speed train axlebox bearing dataset, the accuracy of the proposed method is 77.56%, 79.33%, and 96.22% under SNR equal-6 dB,-4 dB, and-2 dB respectively. In the meanwhile, the accuracy of the three advanced TL models and four state-of-the-art anti-noise models are below 50 %. The results indicate that the proposed model has good bearing fault diagnosis ability for TL different datasets under noisy conditions.

AB How to evaluate the reliability of the information sources is a significant and open issue in the information fusion of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST). We propose a new method, called the non-parametric plausibility ReliefF (NPReliefF) algorithm, to measure the reliability of information sources based on the criterion that sources providing more evidence aligned with "greater similarity within classes than between classes"are more reliable. The proposed method significantly improves the effect of normal BPAs and weakens the impact of abnormal BPAs on the fusion, even when abnormal BPAs are in the majority, thereby maximizing the correctness of the fusion results. Several numerical examples and an application of pattern recognition show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methodology.

AB Hedonic diversity games are a variant of the classical hedonic games designed to better model a variety of questions concerning diversity and fairness. Previous works mainly targeted the case with two diversity classes (represented as colors in the model) and provided some initial complexity-theoretic and existential results concerning Nash and individually stable outcomes. Here, we design new algorithms accompanied with lower bounds which provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity picture for computing Nash and individually stable outcomes with respect to the most natural parameterizations of the problem. Crucially, our results hold for general hedonic diversity games where the number of colors is not necessarily restricted to two, and show that-apart from two trivial cases-a necessary condition for tractability in this setting is that the number of colors is bounded by the parameter. Moreover, for the special case of two colors we resolve an open question asked in previous work (Boehmer and Elkind, AAAI 2020).(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All reserved.

AB The selection and prioritization of appropriate actions to improve the performance of the railway sector pose a common challenge for policymakers and transport planners. This challenge is further complicated by factors such as political power shifts, policy changes, and socio-economic and environmental impacts, introducing various uncertainties. To address this issue, a novel multi-criteria decision-making framework was developed in this study. The framework introduces the weighted geometric Dombi Maclaurin Symmetric Mean operator within an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, enabling the identification of the most appropriate action from nine different alternatives to enhance the performance of railway sector. Moreover, the study makes an additional contribution by combining this approach with an interval rough PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment to determine the weight coefficients of the criteria. To assess the robustness of the proposed methodology, sensitivity analysis and a comparative study were conducted. The findings of the study indicate that "enhancing the governance of the transport sector" emerged as the most appropriate action to improve the performance of the railway sector.

AB Bridges are one of the critical infrastructure systems and play a critical role in supporting the economic development of nations. During the planning, design, and construction phases of bridges, it is important to ensure that the different bridge components satisfy the desired performance for avoiding catastrophic failure. One example is the foundation system with deep driven piles. A crucial consideration when planning, designing, and constructing bridge foundation system is to accurately estimate the pile resistance (i.e., capacity). However, this process constitutes a considerable challenge for bridge managers and engineers due to the uncertainties, subjectivities, and biases involved in providing accurate estimates. In fact, the current design process of bridge pile foundations is still performed in a relatively simple and deterministic manner. Thus, there is still a lack of studies that were conducted to effectively represent the causalities between different variables impacting the bridge pile resistance using objective, data-driven methods rather than subjective, expert-based methods. Therefore, this paper addresses this knowledge gap by proposing a data-driven, knowledge-discovery Bayesian network model as an expert system to (1) identify the key factors impacting the performance of bridge piles through data-driven knowledge discovery; (2) capture the causal (direct and indirect) relationships between the different variables that influence bridge pile resistance, and (3) predict bridge pile resistance in support of decision making in bridge design and construction. Multiple Bayesian network models were developed using two distinct learning paradigms based on a pile dataset with 18 variables and 2,375 data samples from a large bridge project. One paradigm is to run a regular process for learning graphical models using Bayesian structure learning, while the other one is to couple Bayesian networks with bagging ensemble learning. Model validation results showed that the best model learned by bagging ensemble learning paradigm achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 89.78% for predicting bridge pile resistance. Additionally, the developed Bayesian network models identify 8 critical factors affecting bridge pile resistance. These factors are categorized into four groups, including the external applied force on pile head, pile mechanical property (i.e., compressive stresses in bridge piles), hammer property and operation characteristics (e.g., hammer blow count), and pile cap elevation. The observations from this study would assist bridge managers and practitioners in decreasing the uncertainties that impact the estimation of pile capacity, and thus help in balancing cost-effectiveness with good performance. The paper adds to the body of knowledge by providing a great deal of insights related to the factors and causalities influencing the performance of deep bridge foundations to ultimately help in the plan, design, and construction phases of bridges.

AB Text classification first needs to convert the text into embedding vectors. Considering that static word embedding models such as Word2vec do not consider the position information of word and the difference of its role in different documents, while dynamic word embedding models such as Bert consume a large amount of time. An improved word embedding model based on pre-trained Word2vec is proposed, which achieves better classification accuracy and much lower classification time than Bert. At first, the concept of Term Document Frequency (TDF) is proposed on the basis of TF-IDF, and the TF-IDF-TDF of each word in different documents is calculated. Then, The positional encoding is added. Finally, in order to reduce the misleading of words with low importance, a filter is designed to set the embedding vector with low importance to zero. Considering that the sequence length that the deep learning model can handle is limited, and the text sequence exceeding the Maximum Sequence Length (MSL) set by the deep learning model will be directly truncated and discarded, an adaptive segmentation model is proposed, which can set different segmentation strategies for different texts according to the length of the text and the MSL. In order to maintain the continuity of adjacent text after segmentation, an adjacent-segment-vector-attended co-attention network is designed. In addition, the multi-channel convolution and the capsule network are designed to further extract deep hidden features. Multiple comparative experiment results show that the proposed model achieves the best Accuracy and Micro-F1 on five long text baseline datasets and six short text baseline datasets. In addition, when the MSL is not set too large compared with the document length in the dataset, the classification results of the proposed model are not affected by it.

AB The Internet's rapid development has made web page access an integral part of people's lives, catering to entertainment, socializing, and information retrieval. However, people with visual impairments face challenges in comprehending information and rely on auditory cues. Thankfully, web pages have played a crucial role in bridging this gap by providing them with valuable knowledge about the world. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has emerged as a versatile icon style in web development, surpassing image-based models due to its operational efficiency and non-deformable properties. Nonetheless, our empirical research reveals several accessibility issues with SVG buttons, particularly the absence of alternative text. Addressing this issue entails overcoming three key challenges, as reflected in it is hard to locate SVG buttons, inability to provide standardized alternative text, and excessive resource costs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated tool called SAM (SVG Accessibility Optimization Method), which supplements missing alternative text in SVG buttons. Our approach involves extensive research, including the identification of 18 common categories of SVG buttons and the creation of 25 corresponding feature templates. SAM employs classification, semantic optimization, and role optimization to enhance the accessibility of SVG buttons. We evaluate SAM by applying it to 30 real-world web pages, successfully providing alternative text with an average F1-score of 92.6%. Compared to other models and image-based baseline methods, SAM demonstrates superior performance with an average F1-score increase of 14.5%. Through the efficiency analysis and a user study, we discuss the advantages of SAM, highlighting its lightweight nature (with First Contentful Paint (FCP) at 0.762 s, Time To Interactive (TTI) at 1.238 s, and memory usage at 18.32 MB). Furthermore, visually impaired users express positive feedback regarding web pages repaired by our tool, underscoring the usefulness of our method.

ID FUZZY; UNIFICATION
AB The unfolding transformation has been widely used in many declarative frameworks for improving the efficiency of programs. Inspired by our previous experiences in fuzzy logic languages that do not deal with similarity relations, in this work we try to adapt such operation to the framework of the fuzzy logic programming language FASILL (acronym of "Fuzzy Aggregators and Similarity Into a Logic Language") which has been developed in our research group for coping with implicit/explicit truth degree annotations, a great variety of connectives and unification by similarity. The traditional unfolding transformation is based on the application of unifiers on the heads and computational steps on the bodies of program rules. However, when considering similarity relations, the premature generation and application of weak (similarity-based) unifiers at unfolding time could destroy the correctness (i.e., the soundness and completeness) of the transformation. In this paper we study how to avoid the risk, by imposing some conditions on programs in order to be safely unfolded. We show that these conditions are sufficient to guarantee the correctness of the unfolding transformation, and we present some experiments performed with the implemented online tool for illustrating the improved efficiency of unfolded programs.

AB The efficient prediction of cloud resource demand plays a crucial role in resource allocation and scheduling in cloud data centers, helping to optimize resource utilization and improve service quality. However, accurately predicting cloud resource demand poses challenges due to the failure of prediction models in real-world scenarios, such as extreme load peaks, and the limitation of computation burden on the global characterization capability. To effectively handle single-variable cloud resource load time series with multidimensional hidden factors, we propose a sample entropy-optimized variational model decomposition transformer (VMDSE-Tformer) for cloud resource scheduling. Hereby, we decompose the time series through variational model decomposition, and then reconstruct the subsequence collection using sample entropy calculation. Then, we use a class Transformer framework with a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn deep features and obtain encoding representations of each component sequence. We conduct sufficient experiments on three benchmark datasets by comparing them with five state-of-the-art models. Notably, the MAPE of VMDSE-Tformer is improved by about 60% compared to LSTNet. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our VMDSE-Tformer in terms of predicting task sequence intensity, CPU, and RAM resource demand. Therefore, VMDSE-Tformer can serve as a powerful and efficient tool to predict resource demand in cloud data centers, with implications for more effective resource management and service delivery.

   detection
AB Deepfake image detection has emerged as an important area of research due to its wide-ranging implications for various security systems. In particular, in the field of deep learning, the task of detecting fake images has traditionally been challenging due to its complicated and abstract nature, especially in the field of computer vision where accurate analysis and understanding of facial landmarks play a crucial role. This study introduces a rational-augmented convolutional neural network (RACNN) for deepfake image detection. The RACNN combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a reasoning generator, which generates binary masks to highlight the crucial regions that contribute to the CNN's decision-making process. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the reasoning generator, a reinforcement learning technique is used to train it to generate accurate and compact masks. Through extensive experiments conducted on a large dataset of deepfake images, the effectiveness of the RACNN method is demonstrated, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 94.87% on an open-source dataset, namely FaceForensics++. The comparative analysis shows the superiority of the RACNN model over existing approaches, especially in terms of accuracy. This robustly demonstrates the effectiveness of the RACNN in accurately distinguishing between real and fake images. The AUC of 95.69% on the dataset serves as a strong indication of the effectiveness of our proposed method in accurately detecting fake facial images generated by various deepfake techniques. Our model proves to be a promising way to advance the field of deepfake image detection, providing potential improvements to the capabilities of such systems.

ID DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS
AB Road authorities need efficient tools to assign a limited budget to safety improvement projects. The process of prioritizing safety improvement projects needs to predict the benefits and costs of projects. In real-life situations and also because of variances of crash frequency, crash modification factor (CMF), and imposed expenses, the forecast of project costs/benefits would be highly affected by uncertainty. Hence, this work develops a model based on stochastic binary programming with robust constraints to treat the inherent uncertainties to prioritize road safety improvement projects. Robust optimization approach ensures a high probability of feasibility for the solutions obtained under uncertain conditions. Efficiency of the suggested model is assessed using data collected from a real case study. Numerical results reveal that neglecting stochastic analysis would lead to a profit loss up to 15% of the total benefits of safety plan and the importance of considering stochastic nature of the problem increases as the budget of a safety plan decreases. Furthermore, to make a comparative analysis, the developed methodology is compared with some conventional methods, e.g., integer programming model and incremental benefit-cost analysis. Main findings demonstrate some deviations concerning how each approach copes with uncertainty which leads to differences in the list of the selected projects with respect to budget limitation. Finally, the developed methodology is recommended to managers as a flexible and robust tool to assess and select projects through setting the level of robustness against cost data uncertainty, which is done according to the decision-makers' attitudes.

   activation functions
AB The deep learning architectures' activation functions play a significant role in processing the data entering the network to provide the most appropriate output. Activation functions (AF) are created by taking into consideration aspects like avoiding model local minima and improving training efficiency. Negative weights and vanishing gradients are frequently taken into account by the AF suggested in the literature. Recently, a number of non-monotonic AF have increasingly replaced previous methods for improving convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In this study, two novel non-linear non-monotonic activation functions, alpha-SechSig and alpha-TanhSig are proposed that can overcome the existing problems. The negative part of alpha-SechSig and alpha-TanhSig is non-monotonic and approaches zero as the negative input decreases, allowing the negative part to retain its sparsity while introducing negative activation values and non-zero derivative values. In experimental evaluations, alpha-SechSig and alpha-TanhSig activation functions were tested on MNIST, KMNIST, Svhn_Cropped, STL-10, and CIFAR-10 datasets. In addition, better results were obtained than the non-monotonic Swish, Logish, Mish, Smish, and monotonic ReLU, SinLU, and LReLU AF known in the literature. Moreover, the best accuracy score for the alpha SechSig and alpha TanhSig activation functions was obtained with MNIST at 0.9959 and 0.9956, respectively.

Ban and Coroianu completed the calculation and provided a computational formula. However, symmetric trapezoidal approximation cannot be deduced from their conclusions. The aim of this paper is to continue and foster the development of this topic. The calculation for the symmetric trapezoidal approximations of a fuzzy number under a general condition will be completed in this paper. Some applications related with value, expected value and ambiguity, which are important parameters, are given too. Numerical examples are given and the quantitative improvement in approximation is also addressed.

AB Breast cancer is the main cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Several diagnostic methods, including mammography, ultrasound, and biopsy, are used to discover breast tumors, since early identification and diagnosis are crucial for improved treatment results. This work aims to identify and classify breast cancer using logistic regression with kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA) dimensionality reduction and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classification (LR-KPCA-LS-SVM). Earlier categorization schemes for breast cancer were plagued by inaccuracies in diagnosis and inefficiency. The suggested LR-KPCA-LS-SVM solves these problems by lowering complexity, concentrating on key characteristics, and integrating different approaches and algorithms to improve accuracy. The LR-KPCA-LS-SVM has accuracy rates of 95% and 96%, SVM has accuracy rates of 85% and 83%, KNN has accuracy rates of 89% and 88%, and CNN has accuracy rates of 80% and 88% when applied over WBCD and WDBC datasets.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB There are many vague and uncertain issues in real-life. To address these problems, many models and theories have been developed. Entropy is used to express the mathematical values of the fuzziness of generalized hesitant trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GHTF-numbers) and so it is a measure of the fuzziness of the GHTF-numbers. However, the entropy measures have not been applied to GHTF-numbers. Therefore, in the paper, we introduce the concept of entropy measures for GHTF-number and discuss its desirable properties. Then, we develop a VIKOR method based on the entropy measure for novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. In the decision-making framework, the proposed method is not only a way to solve the problem of MCDM, but also contains an important mathematical idea as a different solution approach. We solve an illustrative example of the MCDM method and compare the obtained results with the results of other existing methods. The proposed VIKOR decision-making process is more suitable than the existing ones to deal with uncertain and imprecise information and offers numerous choices to the decision-maker for accessing the infinite alternatives. Furthermore, the result is more significant because the difference between any two values of alternatives is greater.

ID COMPETING FAILURE PROCESSES; BELIEF RELIABILITY; SYSTEMS; SUBJECT
AB In fields such as aerospace and nuclear materials, there is no large amount of sample data available for reference due to cost and experimental environment; probabilistic theory based on large sample data is not suitable for assessing the reliability of equipment. Due to the lack of a large amount of failure data, the reliability assessment of the equipment has to rely on the empirical data of experts in the field, which have artificial cognitive uncertainty, and uncertainty theory is an effective mathematical tool to analyze the artificial cognitive data. In the uncertain environment, this paper considers the competing failure processes where the failure threshold is an uncertain variable, calculates the reliability of the device under three different shock models, and compares the reliability of the uncertain thresholds with the reliability of the constant thresholds. The results show that in different periods of equipment operation, the reliability of the uncertain thresholds is different with the reliability of the constant thresholds. If the threshold is simply regarded as a known constant, it will cause inaccuracies in the reliability assessment of the system, miss the best maintenance time, and cause unnecessary losses. Taking the microelectronic mechanical system as an example, the superiority of the proposed model is illustrated.

AB Over the past decade, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated their effectiveness across various computationally expensive real-world domains. Nevertheless, the focus of surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithms has primarily centered on non-constrained optimization problems. There has been relatively limited exploration into addressing expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problems, which inherently require a delicate equilibrium between convergence, diversity, and feasibility. To bridge this gap, this paper concentrates on constrained multi-objective optimization problems where both objectives and constraints involve substantial computational costs. In response, a novel data-driven constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced, leveraging feasible region localization and performance-improvement exploration. For feasible region localization, a constraints-domain-search strategy is presented to locate the feasible region quickly. To enhance performance-improvement exploration, a progressive enhancement of convergence and diversity is achieved through the incorporation of constraint penalties. With the help of exploration and exploitation, the proposed algorithm can balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility while working within a limited number of function evaluations. By comparing the proposed algorithm with state-ofthe-art algorithms on 66 mathematical problems and a resource-intensive black-box problem, its outstanding performance for solving multi-objective constrained black-box problems is validated.

AB Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the illumination intensity while restoring color information. Despite recent advancements using deep learning methods, they still struggle with over or under-exposure in complex lighting scenes and poor color recovery in dark regions. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel pipeline (called LRCR-Net) to perform Light Restoration and Color Refinement in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the coarse step, we focus on improving the illumination adaptively while avoiding inappropriate enhancement in the brighter or darker regions. This is achieved by introducing a region-calibrated residual block (RCRB) that balances local and global dependencies among different image regions. In the fine step, we aim to retouch the color of the images enhanced in the coarse step. To achieve this goal, we propose learnable image processing operators (LIPOs), including contrast and saturation operators, to refine the color according to the input images' color and contrast information. The final result is an image with proper illumination and rich color. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (NASA, LIME, MEF, and NPE) show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB A dynamic gain fixed-time (FXT) robust zeroing neural network (DFTRZNN) model is proposed to effectively solve time-variant equality constrained quaternion least squares problem (TV-EQLS). The proposed approach surmounts the shortcomings of conventional numerical algorithms which fail to address time-variant problems. The DFTRZNN model is constructed with a novel dynamic gain parameter and a novel activation function (NAF), which differs from previous zeroing neural network (ZNN) models. Moreover, the comprehensive theoretical derivation of the FXT stability and robustness of the DFTRZNN model is presented in detail. Simulation results further confirm the availability and superiority of the DFTRZNN model for solving TV-EQLS. Finally, the consensus protocols of multiagent systems are presented by utilizing the design scheme of the DFTRZNN model, which further demonstrates its practical application value.

ID FICTITIOUS PLAY; GAMES; INEQUALITY; LEVEL
AB Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a popular method for finding approximate Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games with imperfect information. Solving large-scale games with CFR needs a combination of abstraction techniques and certain expert knowledge, which constrains its scalability. Recent neural-based CFR methods mitigate the need for abstraction and expert knowledge by training an efficient network to directly obtain counterfactual regret without abstraction. However, these methods only consider estimating regret values for individual actions, neglecting the evaluation of state values, which are significant for decision-making. In this article, we introduce deep dueling CFR (D2CFR), which emphasizes the state value estimation by employing a novel value network with a dueling structure. Moreover, a rectification module based on a time-shifted Monte Carlo simulation is designed to rectify the inaccurate state value estimation. Extensive experimental results are conducted to show that D2CFR converges faster and outperforms comparison methods on test games.

ID SPARSE REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK
AB In this article, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection method named pseudo-label guided structural discriminative subspace learning (PSDSL). Unlike the previous methods that perform the two stages independently, it introduces the construction of probability graph into the feature selection learning process as a unified general framework, and therefore the probability graph can be learned adaptively. Moreover, we design a pseudo-label guided learning mechanism, and combine the graph-based method and the idea of maximizing the between-class scatter matrix with the trace ratio to construct an objective function that can improve the discrimination of the selected features. Besides, the main existing strategies of selecting features are to employ l(2,1) -norm for feature selection, but this faces the challenges of sparsity limitations and parameter tuning. For addressing this issue, we employ the l(2,0) -norm constraint on the learned subspace to ensure the row sparsity of the model and make the selected feature more stable. Effective optimization strategy is given to solve such NP-hard problem with the determination of parameters and complexity analysis in theory. Ultimately, extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets and three biological ScRNA-seq genes datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the data clustering downstream task.

Although the task is highly related to vision and force, current methods lack a unified mechanism to effectively fuse the two sensors. We consider coordinating multimodality from perception to control and propose a vision-force curriculum policy learning scheme to effectively fuse the features and generate policy. Experiments in simulations indicate the priorities of our method, which could insert pegs with 0.1 mm clearance. Furthermore, the system is generalizable to various initial configurations and unseen shapes, and it can be robustly transferred from simulation to reality without fine-tuning, showing the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method.

AB Various forms of materials, such as pictures, videos and texts, have rapidly brought the college English translation teaching model into the era of multimedia integration. This makes it difficult for English teachers to improve college English translation by using unique materials, so as to form their own unique teaching style. In view of this, a multimedia comprehensive English translation framework based on the combination of big data technology and multimedia teaching mode is proposed. At the same time, the idea of building the framework is introduced from two perspectives: the integration of big data technology and multimedia, and the integration of multimedia and English teaching process. Then, a recursive neural network algorithm based on ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed and tested. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method has significantly improved the accuracy and retention rate, indicating the effectiveness of the framework.

AB As a result of significant advancements in living conditions, individuals have redirected their attention towards physical exercise. Skiing, as a widely popular sport, necessitates the real-time maintenance of correct posture during movement. Therefore, we present a dynamic skiing motion capture and human posture detection model that leverages wireless device tracking. Primarily, personnel tracking is enabled through the construction of service base stations and the utilization of wireless device tracking technology. Subsequently, a human posture detection model is formulated in the form of human posture key points, employing the image information of each frame obtained via wireless devices. Finally, we introduce a spatio-temporal Transformer structure that facilitates the detection and recognition of human posture in consecutive frames. Our results demonstrate that our approach can precisely locate and track the position of skiing personnel. Compared to the latest Blip and Conformer methods, our technique yields F values that surpass them by 1.20% and 4.51%, respectively. Moreover, our model can achieve convergent model parameters and accomplish training objectives more efficiently, thus enabling posture detection and dynamic capture of skiing personnel via image and video information.

ID DUAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Among many k -winners-take-all ( k WTA) models, the dual-neural network (DNN- k WTA) model is with significantly less number of connections. However, for analog realization, noise is inevitable and affects the operational correctness of the k WTA process. Most existing results focus on the effect of additive noise. This brief studies the effect of time-varying multiplicative input noise. Two scenarios are considered. The first one is the bounded noise case, in which only the noise range is known. Another one is for the general noise distribution case, in which we either know the noise distribution or have noise samples. For each scenario, we first prove the convergence property of the DNN- k WTA model under multiplicative input noise and then provide an efficient method to determine whether a noise-affected DNN-k WTA network performs the correct k WTA process for a given set of inputs. With the two methods, we can efficiently measure the probability of the network performing the correct k WTA process. In addition, for the case of the inputs being uniformly distributed, we derive two closed-form expressions, one for each scenario, for estimating the probability of the model having correct operation. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify our theoretical results.

AB Spectral clustering and its extensions usually consist of two steps: 1) constructing a graph and computing the relaxed solution and 2) discretizing relaxed solutions. Although the former has been extensively investigated, the discretization techniques are mainly heuristic methods, e.g., k -means (KM), spectral rotation (SR). Unfortunately, the goal of the existing methods is not to find a discrete solution that minimizes the original objective. In other words, the primary drawback is the neglect of the original objective when computing the discrete solution. Inspired by the first-order optimization algorithms, we propose to develop a first-order term to bridge the original problem and discretization algorithm, which is the first nonheuristic to the best of our knowledge. Since the nonheuristic method is aware of the original graph cut problem, the final discrete solution is more reliable and achieves the preferable loss value. We also theoretically show that the continuous optimum is beneficial to discretization algorithms though simply finding its closest discrete solution is an existing heuristic algorithm which is also unreliable. Sufficient experiments significantly show the superiority of our method.

AB This paper is concerned with coupling memory sampled-data state-feedback control for T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delays on the basic of the delay-product-type augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) method. The sampled-data control satisfies a Bernoulli distribution sequence and the sampling period is nonconstant. Furthermore, an augmented LKF included time-varying delay and sampling time is proposed to decrease the conservatism. The limiting conditions of some matrices in LKF are relaxed to make LKF more general. In addition, the integral inequality technique and weight matrix are used to make the results more flexible. The gain matrices of controller which guaranteed the asymptotically stable for system with H-infinity performance is obtained. Finally, the validity of the results is verified by two numerical examples.

AB Malignant tissue in the skin is highly harmful. As melanoma is of identical look and lacks color variation, detection of skin cancer from dermatoscopic scans is a difficult task. The raw dataset is imbalanced that has been rarely studied. This is considered in this work to improve the accuracy level. The data have been studied and balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The classifiers are considered as fuzzy-based classifiers that are statistical in nature and can pick the specific class, so that all the oversampled may not be useful except the informative samples. A combination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble learning termed a hybrid ensemble learning model is proposed. The homogeneity is formed by using two similar models, i.e., two adaptive resonance theory mapping (ARTMAP) models. One ARTMAP is trained with the raw imbalanced dataset, whereas the other one is trained with the balanced dataset. The heterogeneity is considered using fuzzy min-max (FMM) as the third base classifier. Its learning strategy is different from ARTMAP. Finally, the classification is performed using the rule-based neuro-Fuzzy classification (NEFCLASS) model. The open-source Kaggle HAM10000 skin dermatoscopic dataset is used for the training and detection of skin cancer. The proposed model provided 98.4% classification accuracy that competes with state-of-the-art models in the field of skin cancer detection. An improved form of ensemble learning is proved to be an efficient choice in the field of image processing.

AB This paper studies the fixed-time fuzzy adaptive tracking control problem for a class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown virtual control coefficients (UVCCs), full state constraints and external disturbances. A novel barrier Lyapunov function is constructed to overcome the UVCCs and the state constraints simultaneously. Fuzzy-logic systems are implemented to approximate uncertain nonlinear functions of the system. Using fuzzy-logic systems and the first-order filter, the dynamic surface control is combined with backstepping design to tackle the problem of computational complexity. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a fixed-time fuzzy controller is designed such that not only the closed-loop system is practically fixed-time stable but also the tracking error converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. It is shown that the settling time of the proposed control method is independent of the initial conditions of the controlled system. At last, a simulation example of a single-link robot manipulator is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented scheme.

AB The solid waste collection problem refers to truck route optimisation to collect waste from containers across various locations. Recent concerns exist over the impact of solid waste management on the environment. Hence, it is necessary to find feasible routes while minimising operational costs and fuel consumption. In this paper, in order to reduce fuel consumption, the number of trucks used is considered in the objective function along with the waste load and the travelling time. With the current computational capabilities, finding an optimal solution is challenging. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of well-known metaheuristic methods on this problem's objective function and computational times. The routing solver in the Google OR-tools solver is utilised with three well-known metaheuristic methods for neighbourhood exploration: a guided local search (GLS), a tabu search (TS), and simulated annealing (SA), with two initialisation strategies, Clarke and Wright's algorithm and the nearest neighbour algorithm. Results showed that optimal solutions are found in faster computational times than using only an IP solver, especially for large instances. Local search methods, notably GLS, have significantly improved the route construction process. The nearest neighbour algorithm has often outperformed the Clarke and Wright's methods. The findings here can be applied to improve operations in Saudi Arabia's waste management sector.

AB The key to improve the service effect of virtual digital human is the personality trait recognition technology of users. However, the complexity of Chinese and the sparsity of short texts limit the accuracy of personality trait recognition. Therefore, we applied emotional features to the research of personality trait recognition and constructed a deep learning model for Chinese corpus personality trait recognition to improve the accuracy of personality trait recognition. The model (R-Be) extracted semantic features and embedded emotional features through RoBERTa-wwm-ext Chinese pre-training model, BiLSTM neural network, and attention mechanism. Some experiments were carried out using two Chinese datasets with different scenes. The comparative experiments and ablation experiments showed that the overall effect of the personality trait recognition model (R-Be) is the best, and the Macro-F1 value reaches 75.3%, which is significantly better than the existing models. The results showed that emotional features can significantly improve the accuracy of multi-label personality trait classification in both Chinese daily life scenarios and online scenarios. The proposed model can integrate emotional features and Chinese semantic features to improve the accuracy of personality traits recognition. These findings support the development of personality trait recognition and the application of virtual digital human.

DE Spurious correlations; Vision transformers; Generalization
AB Deep neural networks may be susceptible to learning spurious correlations that hold on average but not in atypical test samples. As with the recent emergence of vision transformer (ViT) models, it remains unexplored how spurious correlations are manifested in such architectures. In this paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of different transformer architectures to spurious correlations on three challenging benchmark datasets. Our study reveals that for transformers, larger models and more pre-training data significantly improve robustness to spurious correlations. Key to their success is the ability to generalize better from the examples where spurious correlations do not hold. Further, we perform extensive ablations and experiments to understand the role of the self-attention mechanism in providing robustness under spuriously correlated environments. We hope that our work will inspire future research on further understanding the robustness of ViT models to spurious correlations.

AB Human oversight has become a key mechanism for the governance of artificial intelligence ("AI"). Human overseers are supposed to increase the accuracy and safety of AI systems, uphold human values, and build trust in the technology. Empirical research suggests, however, that humans are not reliable in fulfilling their oversight tasks. They may be lacking in competence or be harmfully incentivised. This creates a challenge for human oversight to be effective. In addressing this challenge, this article aims to make three contributions. First, it surveys the emerging laws of oversight, most importantly the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act ("AIA"). It will be shown that while the AIA is concerned with the competence of human overseers, it does not provide much guidance on how to achieve effective oversight and leaves oversight obligations for AI developers underdefined. Second, this article presents a novel taxonomy of human oversight roles, differentiated along whether human intervention is constitutive to, or corrective of a decision made or supported by an AI. The taxonomy allows to propose suggestions for improving effectiveness tailored to the type of oversight in question. Third, drawing on scholarship within democratic theory, this article formulates six normative principles which institutionalise distrust in human oversight of AI. The institutionalisation of distrust has historically been practised in democratic governance. Applied for the first time to AI governance, the principles anticipate the fallibility of human overseers and seek to mitigate them at the level of institutional design. They aim to directly increase the trustworthiness of human oversight and to indirectly inspire well-placed trust in AI governance.

AB In the present study, qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted to explore differences between stakeholders in expectations of gendered robots, with a focus on their specific application in the field of psychotherapy. In Study I, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 experts in psychotherapy to extract categories of opinions regarding the use of humanoid robots in the field. Based on these extracted categories, in Study II, an online questionnaire survey was conducted to compare concrete expectations of the use of humanoid robots in psychotherapy between 50 experts and 100 nonexperts in psychotherapy. The results revealed that compared with the female participants, the male participants tended to prefer robots with a female appearance. In addition, compared with the experts, the nonexperts tended not to relate the performance of robots with their gender appearance, and compared with the other participant groups, the female expert participants had lower expectations of the use of robots in the field. These findings suggest that differences between stakeholders regarding the expectations of gendered robots should be resolved to encourage their acceptance in a specific field.

AB The continuous global urbanization with rapid and dynamic transitioning in traffic situations among highly populated cities results in difficulty for data collection and communication. Data collection for millions of vehicles hinders by various problems, i.e., higher cost of energy, time, space, and storage resources. Moreover, higher data traffic results in higher delays, larger throughput, excessive bottlenecks, and frequent repetition of data. To better facilitate the aforementioned challenges and to provide a solution, we have proposed a lightweight Machine Learning based data collection protocol named ML-TDG to effectively deal with higher data volumes in a real-time traffic environment capable of bringing the least burden on the network while utilizing less space, time, and energy. ML-TDG is functional based on Apache Spark, an effective data processing engine that indexes the data based on two logs, i.e., old commuters or frequent/daily commuters and second new/occasional commuters. The proposed protocol's main idea is to utilize real-time traffic, distinguish the indexes in parallel based on two assigned logs criteria to train the network, and collect data with the least sources. For energy and time optimization, dynamic segmentation switching is introduced which is an intelligent road segments division and switching for reducing bottlenecks and replication. ML-TDG is tested and verified on Dublin, Ireland's busiest motorway M50. ML-TDG performs the data collection, data sorting, and network training to decide the next execution altogether for better optimization every time. The experimental results verify that our proposed protocol is attaining higher performance with lower resource requirements along with rich and time-efficient sustainable data collection clusters in comparison with baseline protocols.

SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Semantic segmentation; Real time; Vision transformer; Multiscale feature
AB Recently, owing to the requirements of inference speed, most real-time semantic segmentation networks often have shallow network depth, which limits the receptive field size of the model, leading to the limited acquisition of semantic information and resulting in intraclass inconsistency and ultimately a decrease in segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the shallow network depth also restricts the feature extraction capability of the network, reducing its robustness and ability to adapt to complex scenes. To address these issues, a bilateral network with a rich semantic extractor (RSE) for real-time semantic segmentation (BRSeNet) is presented to perform real-time semantic segmentation. First, to solve the problem of insufficient semantic feature information extraction, an RSE is proposed, which includes a multiscale global semantic extraction module (MGSEM) and a semantic fusion module (SFM). The MGSEM can extract rich global semantics and expand the effective receptive field. Simultaneously, the SFM efficiently integrates multiscale local semantics with multiscale global semantics, resulting in more comprehensive semantic information for the network. Finally, based on the characteristics of detail and semantic branches, a bilateral reconstruction aggregation module is designed to reconstruct the contextual information of detail features, model the interdependencies on semantic feature channels, and enhance feature representation. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets are conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed BRSeNet achieves mean intersection over union of 74.9% and 35.7% at inference speeds of 74 and 65 frames per second, respectively, and ensures a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

AB The emergence of blockchain technology and the Internet of Things has improved the efficiency and quality of social production, thus accelerating the speed of economic development. The calculation of issue spreads for Tier 2 capital bonds, mainly using a centralized settlement system, ignores the transparency of the data and leads to a high degree of uncertainty in the results of issue spread analysis. The current status of secondary capital bond issuance is analysed and a conceptual definition of blockchain and secondary capital bond is completed as the theoretical support for the subsequent empirical study. Bond issuance data are collected within the wind database as empirical research data, and ordinary bonds are selected as the reference object to put forward three empirical research hypotheses. Utilizing the bond issuance spread research model centered on the blockchain model for empirical analysis, the research results show that the secondary capital bond issuance spread is significantly lower than ordinary bonds.

AB Attributed network embedding aims to extract latent features of complex networks from structural topology and node attributes. Existing embedding models either use two separate learning processes to capture the complementarity of network topology and node attributes, or one process to capture their consistency. However, it is rare to simultaneously consider the complementarity and consistency of the network topology and node attributes in a single model, and network noise is often ignored. To address these issues, an unsupervised adversarial enhanced attributed network embedding model is proposed in this paper, called AEANE. The model firstly designs a novel feature extractor to simultaneously learn the consistency and complementarity features of node attributes and network topology, aiming to capture more accurate and comprehensive features. Secondly, a noisy version of the feature extractor is constructed as a fake feature generator to quickly generate more unseen fake features, aiming to simulate network noise and construct two game players. Finally, a novel adversarial auto-encoder network is designed, which integrates the auto-encoder network and the generative adversarial network into a single network, aiming to quickly learn robust node embedding and tolerate network noise. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and three analysis tasks demonstrate the advantages of our AEANE model.

AB In the field of health care, anesthesia is a crucial therapeutic measure, but it also carries certain risks. Insufficient or excessive anesthesia can lead to significant consequences for patients, such as intraoperative awareness and impaired spontaneous breathing. Therefore, monitoring the depth of anesthesia is one of the vital life-supporting measures during clinical surgery. Currently, commonly used clinical indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are used to estimate the depth of anesthesia in patients. However, due to variations in patients' physical conditions and anesthesia medications, these indicators exhibit significant differences in their performance such that there is not reliable that analyzing these clinical indicators alone. Therefore, considering that electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects a high degree of brain activity, this paper proposes an intelligent detection for anesthesia based on the transformer framework and EEG signals. First, the original single-channel EEG is preprocessed to extract spectral and differential entropy features. Subsequently, the two types of features are fused and sent to the transformer encoder network to complete the anesthesia depth prediction. Finally, the validation of the proposed algorithm was completed on the sevoflurane anesthesia dataset from Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, New Zealand, and a high prediction probability of 85.32% was achieved.

AB Recently, diffusion models have been proven to perform remarkably well in text-to-image synthesis tasks in a number of studies, immediately presenting new study opportunities for image generation. Google's Imagen follows this research trend and outperforms DALLE2 as the best model for text-to-image generation. However, Imagen merely uses a T5 language model for text processing, which cannot ensure learning the semantic information of the text. Furthermore, the Efficient UNet leveraged by Imagen is not the best choice in image processing. To address these issues, we propose the Swinv2-Imagen, a novel text-to-image diffusion model based on a Hierarchical Visual Transformer and a Scene Graph incorporating a semantic layout. In the proposed model, the feature vectors of entities and relationships are extracted and involved in the diffusion model, effectively improving the quality of generated images. On top of that, we also introduce a Swin-Transformer-based UNet architecture, called Swinv2-Unet, which can address the problems stemming from the CNN convolution operations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by using three real-world datasets, i.e. MSCOCO, CUB and MM-CelebA-HQ. The experimental results show that the proposed Swinv2-Imagen model outperforms several popular state-of-the-art methods.

However, besides the evidence of the correct choice, the text usually contains some content related to other choices as well, which causes multi-choice models vulnerable to being confused by candidate choices, and we denote it as choice confusion problem. To alleviate this challenge, we propose two auxiliary mechanisms to distinguish the confusing choices. Specifically, a query-guided attention (QGA) mechanism is designed to automatically filter the text contents causing confusion by measuring the syntactic relevance between different contents and the query. Meanwhile, a confusion-aware training (CAT) mechanism is designed to learn the correct and easily confused choices asynchronously and perform a pushing-away operation between their selection processes. We conduct experiments on multi-choice tasks based on sentences and passages. The results show that our framework improves the choice selection accuracy compared to strong baselines. Furthermore, the ablation test and case study verify the effectiveness of our proposed QGA and CAT, especially in addressing the choice confusion problem.

DT Article; Early Access

ID SPECIFICATION
AB Traditional spatial enabled grammars lack flexibility in specifying the spatial semantics of graphs. This paper describes a new graph grammar formalism called the multigranularity Coordinate Graph Grammar (mgCGG) for spatial graphs. Based on the Coordinate Graph Grammar (CGG), the mgCGG divides coordinates into two categories, physical coordinates and grammatical coordinates, where physical coordinates are the common coordinates in the real world, and grammatical coordinates describe the restrictions on the spatial semantics. In the derivation and reduction of the mgCGG, the spatial matching conditions between nodes are evaluated on the basis of the grammatical coordinates, which can be obtained by the specified granularities. By adjusting the granularities, both qualitative and quantitative analyses for spatial semantics can be obtained, including the transition states between them. In addition, a new redex searching algorithm with polynomial time complexity is designed for the mgCGG. A running example of drawing a flowchart is given to illustrate a practical application of the mgCGG. Through a detailed comparison with related spatial-enabled grammars, it is found that the mgCGG has good performance in four critical aspects-the semantics processing mechanism, fault-tolerance, redex searching algorithm, and practical application-providing a flexible yet uniform way to specify spatial graphs and building a bridge between nonspatial and spatial grammars.

AB Industrial process data have the characteristics of heterogeneity, dimensional inconsistency and multi time scales, which increase the difficulty of condition evaluation in industrial process using multi-source data. To address these problems, a multi-source heterogeneous data fusion model is proposed for the condition evaluation of aluminum electrolysis cell. Firstly, the deep residual network (ResNet) is used to extract the superheat degree features of the fire hole video, the ResNet and wavelet packet are used to extract the cell voltage features, thereby achieving the isomorphism of heterogeneous data. An anode current features extraction method based on dynamic pivotal sequence is used to reduce the dimension of anode current data and extract features. Then, a fusion model of feature layer and data layer based on CatBoost is proposed, which comprehensively considers the material-energy balance mechanism knowledge and current efficiency to describe the dynamic coupling relationship between various data sources. The experimental evaluation results on the actual industrial aluminum electrolysis dataset show that our method improves the performance by 2.3% compared with existing multi-source data fusion method.

TI Driving mode analysis-How uncertain functional inputs propagate to an
   output
SO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE dimension reduction; sensitivity analysis; visualization
AB Driving mode analysis elucidates how correlated features of uncertain functional inputs jointly propagate to produce uncertainty in the output of a computation. Uncertain input functions are decomposed into three terms: the mean functions, a zero-mean driving mode, and zero-mean residual. The random driving mode varies along a single direction, having fixed functional shape and random scale. It is uncorrelated with the residual, and under linear error propagation, it produces an output variance equal to that of the full input uncertainty. Finally, the driving mode best represents how input uncertainties propagate to the output because it minimizes expected squared Mahalanobis distance amongst competitors. These characteristics recommend interpretation of the driving mode as the single-degree-of-freedom component of input uncertainty that drives output uncertainty. We derive the functional driving mode, show its superiority to other seemingly sensible definitions, and demonstrate the utility of driving mode analysis in an application. The application is the simulation of neutron transport in criticality experiments. The uncertain input functions are nuclear data that describe how 239$$ {}<^>{239} $$Pu reacts to bombardment by neutrons. Visualization of the driving mode helps scientists understand what aspects of correlated functional uncertainty have effects that either reinforce or cancel one another in propagating to the output of the simulation.

AB This article proposes a model free position-force control method for uncertain environmental constrained reconfigurable manipulators based on adaptive dynamic programming algorithm. Through the analysis of kinematic uncertainties, an adaptive estimation scheme is designed to obtain the approximate contacted torque. The contacted torque is generated due to the interaction of the manipulator's end-effector with the uncertain environment. Then, the performance index function is defined by utilizing the joint position, contacted torque tracking errors and uncertain environmental factors. The presented neural network-based observer is utilized to learn the dynamic model. On the basis of policy iteration algorithm, the corresponding Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation is addressing by employing the critic NN structure. Thus, the model free position-force control strategy is obtained. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the tracking error of the reconfigurable manipulator is proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded. Eventually, simulations and experiments are illustrated the effectiveness of the developed controller.

AB In a labor market that demands a workforce well-trained in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, it is required of children to successfully develop their mathematical skills in order to become highly productive adults. Recent developments in computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and medical imaging techniques give us new opportunities for building intelligent support tools to help us learn more about the neural underpinnings of how children learn math and how that knowledge relates to individual differences in skill. This study examines the brain activities of students during problem-solving by checking brain structure and its functionality. By using powerful techniques in the light of machine learning and image processing, the relationship between success and the background of a child was researched. The aim is to make a solid prediction of the possible future success of the children by observing their brain activities. The children we investigated were asked different questions to get information about their intelligence. In our study, we have tried to find how those questions and answers may affect the future success of a child. For this purpose, a novel hybrid classification model that utilizes cluster analysis, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and ensemble learning is intended for classification tasks. Our study includes two main stages. Firstly, the image processing techniques were applied to create unique features of brain images. Then, machine learning tecnniques were used to select a set of features, and for getting prediction results our hybrid classification model was applied. In the end, we obtained useful results indicating that there is a complicated connection between the success rate and the history of a child. This novel approach to classification, which combines multiple methods by using a hybrid model, has the potential to be implemented in computational tools for strategic decision support systems.

AB Multi-omics has become a current subject of research in computational bioinformatics and chemometrics to trigger a more accurate understanding of biological processes. The Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) approach has been demonstrated to be a powerful chemometric method convenient for the analysis of multisets with multiple components with strongly overlapped contributions. However, MCR-ALS has yet to be tested to analyze multi-omic data fused at the mid-level. Hence, this study seeks to assess the efficacy of MCR-ALS when analyzing mid-level fused data, both independently and in conjunction with a complementary variance decomposition technique (Joint and Individual Variation Explained, JIVE), for the evaluation of multi-omic data within the ecotoxicology field. Particularly, we have evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of tributyltin zebrafish embryos by concatenating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics datasets. The developed pipeline demonstrated the importance of the pre-processing and variance decomposition step for improving the MCR-ALS capability to describe the multi-omics data. Our results showed that applying the combination of JIVE and MCR-ALS to the mid-level multi-omic fused data provided a more accurate interpretation of toxicological data. Therefore, integrating these chemometric tools into the analysis of multi-omic data in ecotoxicology could allow a more comprehensive analysis of this complex data, boosting the understanding of the toxicological mechanisms of pollutants.

AB Social progress is a hot topic in our rapidly developing world. Scales with different perspectives are being developed to measure the social progress of countries. One of the prominent is the SPI (Social Progress Index). The EU (European Union) has a structure with powerful interaction and recently expanding. The member countries must have a similar level of social progress to adapt to each other and for the healthy functioning of the union. Therefore this study aims to provide a clustering structure of countries in terms of social progress and evaluate member states via the MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) perspective. In this study there are three phases. First, the k-means algorithm was used to group EU member states that are similar in terms of social progress. Second, a novel LODECI (LOgarithmic DEcomposition Of Criteria Importance) method depending on contrast intensity assesses the criteria weights. Last, a novel hybrid CoCoSo-L (Combined Compromise Solution with LODECI) proposed to rank member countries. According to the results, while the social development level of former members and northern countries are higher, the level of new members and southern countries are lower.

AB Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard for the assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. However, it typically only acquires a set of two-dimensional (2D) slices of the underlying threedimensional (3D) anatomy of the heart, thus limiting the understanding and analysis of both healthy and pathological cardiac morphology and physiology. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic surface reconstruction pipeline capable of reconstructing multi-class 3D cardiac anatomy meshes from raw cine MRI acquisitions. Its key component is a multi-class point cloud completion network (PCCN) capable of correcting both the sparsity and misalignment issues of the 3D reconstruction task in a unified model. We first evaluate the PCCN on a large synthetic dataset of biventricular anatomies and observe Chamfer distances between reconstructed and gold standard anatomies below or similar to the underlying image resolution for multiple levels of slice misalignment. Furthermore, we find a reduction in reconstruction error compared to a benchmark 3D U-Net by 32% and 24% in terms of Hausdorff distance and mean surface distance, respectively. We then apply the PCCN as part of our automated reconstruction pipeline to 1000 subjects from the UK Biobank study in a cross-domain transfer setting and demonstrate its ability to reconstruct accurate and topologically plausible biventricular heart meshes with clinical metrics comparable to the previous literature. Finally, we investigate the robustness of our proposed approach and observe its capacity to successfully handle multiple common outlier conditions.

AB Generating high-quality candidates is very crucial for discriminative target tracking. Siamese network based trackers rely on some fixed anchors to fit the shape of a target. However, in practical tracking, these fixed anchors are insufficient to cover all possible aspect ratios of the target caused by various motions and deformations. In this paper, we propose customized anchor that can fit the current state of the target using only one bounding box at each coordinate point. The customized anchor is generated under the guidance of historical prediction result and initial target state, and is further refined by embedding its shape feature into the regression map. To provide more discriminative feature for generating customized anchor, we design a target-aware based feature correlation module to capture local spatial context and global interaction of target, by which the target feature is more salient while background interference is effectively suppressed. In addition, we propose a dynamic template update method and a simple yet effective lost-target re-search strategy to find the lost-target again. Experiments on benchmarks including OTB100, VOT2019, LaSOT, UAV123, and VOT2018 demonstrate that our tracker achieves promising performance with a real-time speed. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/PPs199/SiamCA.git.

AB In recent years, the application of function approximators, such as neural networks and polynomials, has ushered in a new stage of development in solving optimal control problems. However, considering the existence of approximation errors, the stability of the controlled system cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, in view of the prevalence of approximation errors, we investigate optimal tracking control problems for discrete-time systems. First, a novel value function is introduced into the intelligent critic framework. Second, an implicit method is utilized to demonstrate the boundedness of the iterative value functions with approximation errors. An explicit method is applied to prove the stability of the system with approximation errors. Furthermore, an evolving policy is designed to iteratively tackle the optimal tracking control problem and demonstrate the stability of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is verified through numerical as well as practical examples.

AB Over the years, wearable sensors have gained a lot of attention from the research community due to their noninvasive nature, adoption of sensors by general public, and their applicability in healthcare services. With the advancements in communication networks, machine learning methods, and wearable sensor deployment, it is essential to design a method that could accurately classify human activities while reducing the dependence on annotated data. Traditional machine learning approaches require large-scale annotated data in order to provide a reasonable recognition performance. Recently, self-supervised learning methods are proposed but they are either limited to single sensor devices or fail to model intra-modal correlations within the self-supervised learning paradigm. In this work, we propose Representation Fusion using Self-supervised learning for Activity Recognition (ReFuSeAct) framework that uses modality-specific encoders, attention encoders, and decision-level fusion strategies to address the aforementioned limitations. The self-supervised learning paradigm ensures that the method achieves better performance even with less amount of annotated data. The architecture proposed for modality-specific encoder ensures that extraction of representative features that could help in improving recognition performance. The feature-level fusion performed using the proposed attention encoders enhances the quality of representative features that could be used in supervised learning phase. Finally, the decision-level fusion strategy enhances the activity recognition accuracy in comparison to the single deep learning classifier. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach records 9.1% improvement over semi-supervised learning baselines and more than 2% improvement in comparison to existing self-supervised learning approaches.

AB A self-training algorithm is a classical semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples to train a classifier. However, the existing self training algorithms consider only the geometric distance between data while ignoring the data distribution when calculating the similarity between samples. In addition, misclassified samples can severely affect the performance of a self-training algorithm. To address the above two problems, this paper proposes a self training algorithm based on data editing with mass-based dissimilarity (STDEMB). First, the mass matrix with the mass-based dissimilarity is obtained, and then the mass-based local density of each sample is determined based on its k nearest neighbors. Inspired by density peak clustering (DPC), this study designs a prototype tree based on the prototype concept. In addition, an efficient two-stage data editing algorithm is developed to edit misclassified samples and efficiently select high-confidence samples during the self-training process. The proposed STDEMB algorithm is verified by experiments using accuracy and F-score as evaluation metrics. The experimental results on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed STDEMB algorithm.

   Self-attention
AB Federated learning (FL) facilitates multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model without sharing their private data. However, heterogeneous data that is not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) from different clients presents a tough challenge for FL. Existing personalized FL approaches rely heavily on the default treatment of one complete model as a basic unit and ignore the significance of different layers on Non-IID data of clients. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely federated model components self-attention (FedMCSA), to handle Non-IID data in FL, which employs model components self -attention mechanism to granularly promote cooperation between different clients. This mechanism facilitates collaboration between similar model components while reducing interference between model components with large differences. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that FedMCSA outperforms the previous methods on four benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show the effectiveness of the model components self-attention mechanism, which is complementary to existing personalized FL and can significantly improve the performance of FL.

AB Media wield the indispensable social power over the public in various contexts, such as political election, and marketing management. In this paper, we propose a novel opinion dynamics via a signed two-layer network with a time scale to model the participation of media in the co-evolution of public opinions and appraisals. We theoretically analyze the roles of media through investigating the topological evolution of strongly connected components (SCCs). We predict that the media play authoritative roles on both opinion bound and co-evolution rate. The maximal opinion convergence state among the media layer and the sink SCCs of individual layer will finally restrict the opinions of individuals in the non-sink SCCs. The faster updates of media's comments will guide a faster opinion forming process. Besides, we discuss the factors of promoting and suppressing the roles of media, and find that the property of structural balance is significant for media in enhancing their potential to facilitate the public to share the bipartite consensus opinions with media. Our findings witness their sociological meanings in an empirical voting network.

ID NASH EQUILIBRIUM SEEKING; AGGREGATIVE GAMES; ALGORITHMS
AB This paper explores a distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problem for games in which the involved players are of Euler-Lagrange (EL) dynamics with actuator dead zone. To find NE of such games, a novel distributed algorithm with a dynamical dead-zone compensator is proposed. The compensating module in this new strategy is regarded as a fast dynamics that rapidly addresses the effect caused by actuator dead-zone characteristic. The other module of this algorithm is a slow optimizer that enables the actions of EL players to approach the NE. Since the designed strategy is a two-time-scale model, semi-global practical asymptotic stability of this strategy can be obtained by utilizing the generalized singular perturbation method. Finally, an electricity market game with six turbine-generator dynamics is utilized to validate the theoretical result of the proposed method.

TI Dynamic gradient reactivation for backward compatible person

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
LA English
DT Article
DE Person re-identification; Backward compatible training; Deep learning
AB We study the backward compatible problem for person re-identification (Re-ID), which aims to constrain the features of an updated new model to be comparable with the existing features from the old model in galleries. Most of the existing works adopt distillation-based methods, which focus on pushing new features to imitate the distribution of the old ones. However, the distillation-based methods are intrinsically sub-optimal since it forces the new feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space. To address this issue, we propose the Ranking-based Backward Compatible Learning (RBCL), which directly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features. Different from previous methods, RBCL only pushes the new features to find best-ranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment, and is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval. However, the sharp sigmoid function used to make the ranking metric differentiable also incurs the gradient vanish issue, therefore stems the ranking refinement during the later period of training. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Gradient Reactivation (DGR), which can reactivate the suppressed gradients by adding dynamically computed constants during the forward step. To further help target the best -ranking positions, we include the Neighbor Context Agents (NCAs) to approximate the entire old feature space during training. Unlike previous works that mainly test on the in-domain settings, we make the early attempt to introduce the cross-domain settings (including both supervised and unsupervised) for the backward compatible person Re-ID task, which are more challenging yet meaningful. The experimental results on all five settings show that the proposed RBCL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

ID COMPETITION; ALGORITHM
AB Document binarization is a crucial pre-processing step for various document analysis tasks. However, existing methods fail to accurately capture stroke edges, primarily due to the inherent limitations of vanilla convolutions and the absence of adequate boundary-related supervision during stroke edge extraction. In this paper, we formulate text extraction as the learning of gating values and propose an end-to-end network architecture based on gated convolutions, named GDB, to address the problem of imprecise stroke edge extraction. The gated convolutions enable the selective extraction of stroke feature with different attention. Our proposed framework comprises two stages. Firstly, a coarse sub-network with an extra edge branch is trained to enhance the precision of feature maps by incorporating a priori mask and edge information. Secondly, a refinement sub-network is cascaded to enhance the output of the first stage using gated convolutions based on the sharp edges. To effectively incorporate global information, GDB also integrates a parallelized multi-scale operation that combines local and global features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets from 2009 to 2019 and Document Deblurring Datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on average. Extensive ablation studys demonstrate the efficacy of key components.

DE Time optimization; Path parameterization; Sampling; Constraint-checking;

ID OPTIMIZATION; VELOCITY; LIMITS
AB In this paper, a sampling-based time-optimal path parameterization (S-TOPP) method is proposed to address time-optimal trajectory planning problems with bounded jerks. The key insight of S-TOPP is that a tree of feasible nodes connected by edges is established to find a time-optimal trajectory on the temporal dimension. The tree establishment process includes two major phases at each stage, namely sampling and one-step backtracking. In the sampling phase, a new sampling strategy integrating historical information is proposed to obtain superior samples whereby fewer samples can be controlled automatically, reducing the calculation loss. In one-step backtracking phase, a "lazy"strategy is used to lazily skip constraint-checking when evaluating local connections, enabling S-TOPP to avoid checking the vast majority of nodes that have no chance of being in an optimal trajectory. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the feasibility and practicability of S-TOPP. Results show that S-TOPP is an effective solution to jerk-bounded time-optimal trajectory planning, with features that are more in line with the needs of the practical tasks compared with other methods.

AB Recognizing human actions is crucial for an effective and safe collaboration between humans and robots. For example, in a collaborative assembly task, human workers can use gestures to communicate with the robot, and the robot can use the recognized actions to anticipate the next steps in the assembly process, leading to improved safety and productivity. In this work, we propose a general framework for human action recognition based on 3D pose estimation and ensemble techniques, which allows to recognize both body actions and hand gestures. The framework relies on OpenPose and 2D to 3D lifting methods to estimate 3D joints for the human body and the hands, feeding then these joints into a set of graph convolutional networks based on the Shift-GCN architecture. The output scores of all networks are combined using an ensemble approach to predict the final human action. The proposed framework was evaluated on a custom dataset designed for human-robot collaboration tasks, named IAS-Lab Collaborative HAR dataset. The results showed that using an ensemble of action recognition models improves the accuracy and robustness of the overall system; moreover, the proposed framework can be easily specialized on different scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art results on the HRI30 dataset when coupled with an object detector or classifier.

AB The Brain tumor is considered an unusual growth of cells in the nervous system that restricts the normal functionality of the brain. However, is generated in the skull and pressures the brain which affects the health of a person. So it is essential to detect and classify the brain tumor at an early stage before reaching the severity level. Meanwhile, brain tumor detection is performed based on MRI images which are considered an effective diagnosis system. But the detection and classification using MRI images is obtained as a complex task and cannot show the difference between normal and abnormal cells. So to overcome this issue the Crossover Smell Agent Optimized Multilayer Perception (CSA-MLP) is proposed to perform the exact detection and classification of tumor cells from MRI images. The images are collected from three datasets namely MR, Brain MRI, and Brain tumor datasets and they are preprocessed to remove the unwanted noise. After preprocessing the features of the images are extracted to perform the classification process. Moreover, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is used to classify healthy and unhealthy brain cells. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is employed for the classification category that minimized the errors and enhanced the performance of the proposed method. The MLP is integrated with the CSA optimization algorithm to improve classification accuracy. The experimentation results revealed that the proposed method achieved a better accuracy of about 98.56% which enhanced the effectiveness compared to existing methods.

AB With the emergence of artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have been widely deployed in forecasting stock markets. However, existing deep-learning-based models for news-based forecasts of stock trends are mostly black-box and difficult to explain. The procedure by which how final predictions are made within models keeps unknown, making it hard to interpret why one prediction should be better than the other. To provide explanations on predictions, this paper proposes to inject causal inference into model procedures and causally interpret predictions. We first generate a causal graph from financial news, and then integrate the information in the causal graph into a neural network model for stock trend prediction. Moreover, in order to better extract keywords from financial news we introduce a novel keyword extraction method named Distinguishable Word Filtering by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (DWF-KST). The experiment results on five financial datasets demonstrate that not only our proposed model explicitly provides an interpretation of prediction results, but also outperforms the state-of-art methods. the achieved results boost predictions of S&P 500 2 category from 89.7% to 97.4%, 3-category from 77.4% to 82.5%, and 5-category from 61.5% to 71.6%. For the other two indexes, the performances of Dow index improve from 86.2% to 90.2% and Nasdaq index improve from 76.4% to 78.9%.

AB Code vulnerabilities are common in software systems and may cause many problems, including Stack Overflow, memory leaks, and so on. Public reports show that code vulnerabilities are increasing year by year, which brings greater threats to the security of software systems. Thus a variety of neural network models have been developed to detect code vulnerabilities. However, the previous neural network models cannot fully express the semantics and structure of the code with as little overhead as possible, and they also cannot enhance learning of difficult samples. Addressing to this issue, we designed a model built upon GGNN for Detecting Software Vulnerabilities (GDSV), which contains three components. Specifically, Graph Embedding component extracts the semantic and structural features, and generates a graph representation of the code; GGNN component learns these features and detects vulnerabilities in the code; weighted component improves the learning ability of Vulnerable samples through the Focal Loss function. A serial of experiments on the datasets of FFmpeg and QEMU were conducted, and the results show that GDSV performs better than the state-of-the-art efforts based on various widely used evaluations.

ID ABNORMAL EVENT DETECTION; BEHAVIOR DETECTION; LOCALIZATION
AB We study weakly-supervised anomaly detection where only video-level "anomalous"/"normal"labels are available in training, while anomaly events should be temporally localized in testing. For this task, a commonly used framework is multiple instance learning (MIL), where clip instances are sampled from individual videos to form video-level bags. This sampling process arguably is a bottleneck of MIL. If too many instances are sampled, we not only encounter high computational overheads but also have many noisy instances in the bag. On the other hand, when too few instances are used, e.g., through enlarged grids, much background noise may be included in the anomaly instances. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective method named Sub-Max. In partitioned image regions, it identifies instances that are most probable candidates for anomaly events by selecting cuboids that have high optical flow magnitudes. We show that our method effectively brings down the computational cost of the baseline MIL and at the same time significantly filters out the influence of noise. Albeit simple, this strategy is shown to facilitate the learning of discriminative features and thus improve event classification and localization performance. For example, after annotating the event location ground truths of the UCF-Crime test set, we report very competitive accuracy compared with the state of the art on both frame-level and pixel-level metrics, corresponding to classification and localization, respectively.

AB Compared to other well-known biometric technologies based on physiological traits (e.g., fingerprint, iris, and face), heart biometrics are more robust to presentation attacks and are particularly suitable for continuous/periodic recognition. Most studies on heart biometrics concern electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). While the reported results are encouraging, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on the interoperability between ECG and PPG biometrics. We present a novel method that is capable of performing single-domain and multiple-domain identity verifications for ECG and PPG signals, providing interoperability between the heterogeneous cardiac signals. Our method does not require the computation of any reference/fiducial point and uses a compact representation of the given signals. We propose MultiCardioNet, a novel Siamese neural network trained by using an ad hoc learning algorithm. MultiCardioNet computes a similarity score between two spectrogram-based representations of cardiac signals. Our learning algorithm iteratively computes a balanced subset of genuine and impostor pairs during the training epochs. We performed experiments on a dataset containing 1,008 pairs of ECG and PPG samples, obtaining accuracy comparable to that of the state-of-the-art methods for single-domain scenarios and demonstrating only a relatively small performance decrease in the multiple-domain scenario.

AB Clouds often appear in remote sensing images, which seriously affect the application of remote sensing images. Therefore, cloud removal is an important preprocessing process in remote sensing image applications. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network-based cloud removal method for optical remote sensing images with the assistance of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Our model is an end-to-end model, which consists of a translation module, an attention module, a generator, and a discriminator. We introduce the attention mechanism to accurately locate the cloud regions. With the obtained attention maps as the prior information, the proposed method can remove the clouds while preserving the cloud-free regions. In addition, we include the structural similarity index (SSIM) and the attention penalty in the loss function to improve the performance of the proposed method. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model provides improved cloud removal performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Transboundary river basin drought emergencies caused by extreme climate and human activities can increase the risk perception degrees of decision-makers (DMs), causing them to overestimate the consequences of disasters, which could intensify the water competition among riparian countries. To address this issue, this paper treats the basin authorities in upstream and downstream countries as upper- and lower-level DMs, respectively, and a multistage bilevel programming model that considers DMs' risk perceptions is constructed. The model aims to achieve a reasonable water resource allocation scheme by minimizing the risk perception degrees of bilevel DMs that also helps them to pursue the objectives of economic development, social stability, and ecological protection. The value function in prospect theory is modified to describe the risk perception degrees of DMs. To solve the model, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based fuzzy goal programming method is developed, which enables upperlevel DMs to prioritize the minimum satisfactory degree while allowing lower-level DMs to adjust their satisfactory degree accordingly. The proposed model and methods are applied to the Lancang-Mekong River basin, and the comparison results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the risk perception degrees of upper-level DM (with a reduction of up to 43.15%), while maintaining the risk perception degrees of the majority of lower-level DMs (except for Vietnam) relatively stable (fluctuating within the range of 3.03%). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis method is used to analyze the impact of DMs' perceived risks on their risk perception degrees. Finally, some management insights are provided to promote water allocation cooperation throughout the whole river basin.

AB We introduce a general, flexible, and extensible framework for quantitative and qualitative preferences among the stable models of logic programs. Since it is straightforward to capture propositional theories and constraint satisfaction problems with logic programs, our approach is also relevant to optimization in satisfiability testing and constraint processing. We show how complex preference relations can be specified through userdefined preference types and their arguments. We describe how preference specifications are handled internally by so-called preference programs, which are used for dominance testing. We also provide algorithms for computing one, or all, preferred stable models of a logic program, and study the complexity of these problems. We implemented our approach in the asprin system by means of multi-shot answer set solving technology. We demonstrate the generality and flexibility of our methodology by showing how easily existing preference languages can be implemented in asprin. Finally, we empirically evaluate our contributions and contrast them with dedicated implementations. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The transition to low carbon energy systems poses challenges in terms of energy efficiency. In building refurbishment projects, efficient technologies such as smart controls and heat pumps are increasingly being used as a substitute for conventional technologies with the aim of reducing carbon emissions and determining operational energy and cost savings, together with other benefits. Measured building performance, however, often reveals a significant gap between the predicted energy use (design stage) and actual energy use (operation stage). For this reason, lean and interpretable digital twins are needed for building energy monitoring aimed at persistence of savings and continuous performance improvement. In this research, interpretable regression models are built with data at multiple temporal resolutions (monthly, daily and hourly) and seamlessly integrated with the goal of verifying the performance improvements due to Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) and gas absorption heat pumps (GAHPs) as well as giving insights on the performance of the building as a whole. Further, as part of modelling research, time of week and temperature (TOWT) approach is reformulated and benchmarked against its original implementation. The case study chosen is Hale Court sheltered housing, located in the city of Portsmouth (UK). This building has been used for the field-testing of innovative technologies such as TRVs and GAHPs within the EU Horizon 2020 project THERMOSS. The results obtained are used to illustrate possible extensions of the use of energy signature modelling, highlighting implications for energy management and innovative building technologies development.

AB Over the past two decades, an increasing number of large-scale structures have been built around the world. Constructing these structures has been a time consuming and highly expensive process. Thus, providing a structural health monitoring system to guarantee their proper functionality is important. In recent years, the advancement of technology and artificial intelligence methods based on signal processing and machine learning has attracted the attention of researchers. The challenges currently exist in the field of structural health moni-toring to identify and classify damages to achieve high accuracy in a health-monitoring program. The presence of noise in measurement, various exciting load types, and varying environmental conditions cause difficulty in the practical identification and classification of damage in structures. Recent studies have employed finite element modeling to test the effectiveness of proposed methods for identifying damages in structures. However, detecting damage in real-world structures as mentioned above, presents unique difficulties, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods for damage detection in real-world structures remains uncertain. In order to improve the performance of damage detection methods and increase the accuracy of these methods as much as possible, the most important action is to identify damage sensitive data in the structure. The next challenge is to choose a high performance algorithm for damage identification and classification. One of the advanced algorithms, which has a very high ability to extract the desired features from the measured data, is the XGBoost algorithm. This algorithm has recently attracted the attention of researchers and has been used in different fields. So far, the ability of this algorithm has not been examined in the field of damage detection in order to extract desirable features. This article deals with the identification, classification, and severity of damages in the SMC benchmark bridge, which is an existing megastructure in the real world, as well as the IASC-ASCE benchmark structure, whose responses were taken under applied loads in the laboratory environment. First, using the XGBoost algorithm, the impor-tance of the features extracted from the sensors' data is evaluated, and then the features, which are effective in the damage detection process, are selected. The results of this algorithm indicate that only by selecting 6 features from a large volume of data, the best performance can be achieved and selecting more does not help increase efficiency. In the next step, the Stacking method, which is a hybrid machine learning algorithm for damage classification, is evaluated and compared with some conventional machine learning algorithms that have been used in previous studies. The Stacking method stands out as the top performer with an average accuracy rate of 93.1%, leading to the conclusion that it is the most effective approach. Finally, by applying the presented al-gorithm to the two mentioned structures, its validation is appraised.

ID MISSING-DATA
AB Multivariate time series inherently contain missing values due to various issues, including incorrect data entry, broken equipment, and package loss during data transferring. The successful completion of time series data analysis tasks heavily relies on the essential task of imputing missing values. Inter-variable relationships in time series are typically overlooked by missing value imputation techniques. Although some graph-based algorithms can capture these relationships, the design of graph structures is commonly handcrafted and dataset-centric. We introduce a novel Explicit and Implicit Graph Recurrent Network (EIGRN) for multivariate time series imputation that integrates graph and recurrent neural networks to capture variable and time dependencies together. This proficiency is achieved by effectively integrating external data sources such as domain knowledge and the implicit relationships among nodes. In order to make our approach more applicable to datasets with larger numbers of missing values, we additionally discuss the model's performance for various missing value ratios. Our comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different industrial fields.

AB Crop lodging in agricultural fields is one of the major factors that limit cereal crop yields. Wheat, the most popular cereal crop in most countries, is also affected by this phenomenon, which may result in a significant decrease in both yield and quality. Therefore, addressing wheat lodging is crucial for producers. This study aims to detect and identify wheat lodging through aerial images and classify its severity based on ratio, angle and location of the lodging. To achieve this goal, a multi-task approach was proposed involving three phases. First, automatic dataset generation methodology was conducted on orthomosaic imagery of three dates. Next, a comprehensive assessment of wheat lodging (ratio, angle and location) was performed, which has received little research attention. Third, applying and improving selected classification models for classifying image datasets was conducted. Combining convolutional neural networks and temporal sequences in a single model provided an opportunity to use spatiotemporal information extracted from the wheat image datasets. Time dependency and individual dates were both considered in the classification task. The limited number of data and imbalanced classes challenges, resulting from real field conditions data collection, were overcome by applying a new loss function to the classifier models. The overall accuracy of wheat lodging classification reached over 91% in these two states using the proposed approach. Based on this research, wheat lodging was detected more accurately by the proposed models despite the small and imbalanced dataset. The developed methodology paves the way for comprehensive and automatic wheat lodging detection, and the methodology can be adapted for similar crops that suffer lodging issues with suitable modifications.

AB Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is a challenging topic in Natural Language Processing. Recently, deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance for the AES task. However, applying deep learning models to the AES system in practice is expensive when both data collection and model training are taken into consideration. This paper aims to tackle this problem by proposing the Crowdsourcing-based Automated Essay Scoring (CAES) framework. The proposed framework gradually collects data through crowdsourcing and incrementally trains the AES models. In particular, we propose the Incremental Learning with Dynamic Exemplar Herding (ILDEH) approach to simultaneously tackle catastrophic forgetting and concept drift. The proposed approach dynamically updates the exemplar set by the Dynamic Exemplar Herding algorithm to obtain the best approximation of the overall data distribution and selectively apply knowledge distillation on the model outputs by Linear Outlier Suppression loss to retain the learned knowledge. Moreover, we use a lightweight AES model for effective and efficient essay scoring. The experimental results show that our proposed ILDEH approach outperforms other strong baseline approaches for the AES task. Moreover, the CAES framework is able to steadily improve the AES performance in the crowdsourcing environment with only 10.6% training time of the conventional approach. Further analysis shows that one single CPU server can support daily updates of more than 300 AES models, which is sufficient for most practical AES systems.

AB In this paper, we study the personnel task rescheduling problem with time preemption. We assume a baseline task schedule has been composed some time in advance that has been rendered infeasible due to operational uncertainty. When restoring the schedule feasibility, the personnel planner takes several considerations into account encompassing the provided service level, resource stability, and task adherence. The latter stems from the possibility that in the problem under study tasks can be interrupted and resumed later, better known as time preemption. We propose a genetic algorithm complemented with local search techniques to compose an operational schedule in an effective manner. The genetic algorithm operates on a dedicated decoding mechanism to compose high-quality duties for individual workers efficiently. Computational experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of the proposed procedure with other exact and (meta-)heuristic solution procedures, and to demonstrate the value of the algorithm design choices. Furthermore, the impact of preempting tasks in time is assessed by changing the objective function structure and the proportion of non-preemptive tasks.

AB The paper aims to present one of the extensions of the single-valued neutrosophic set, by utilizing the features of the exponential and logarithmic (EL) parameters. The present idea is to integrate the features of the EL operations into the standard neutrosophic set to enhance their diversity. The proposed set is named an exponential-logarithm single-valued neutrosophic set. The major feature of the proposed set is to include one attitude character parameter which can help the decision-maker to give their decision as per their needs. In the defined set, the uncertainties which are present during the analysis are handled with the help of the advancement of the neutrosophic set. Later on, we stated some basic operations to aggregate the information by defining the several weighted operators. The characteristics of these proposed operators are also illustrated in detail. In addition to it, we state the new exponential entropy measure and investigate the impact of the membership degrees of the proposed set. Finally, we construct a multi-attribute group decision-making algorithm to address the decision-making problems based on the stated concept. The attribute weights are derived by using exponential entropy measures. Several case studies are illustrated and the performance of the algorithm is compared with several existing studies. The sensitivity analysis and advantages of the proposed algorithm are also stated.

AB Mining inter-sequence patterns represents a relatively novel research direction, yielding significant contributions to the field of data mining research since its inception. Its versatile applications span various domains, with numerous research avenues emerging as a result. However, it is worth noting that inter-sequence mining algorithms tend to generate a substantial volume of frequent patterns. To date, research efforts in the realm of inter-sequence pattern mining have predominantly focused on creating, copying, and storing all candidate information. This approach has led to potential performance inefficiencies, necessitating more resources than may be inherently required. It is worth highlighting the recent introduction of the pseudo-IDList data structure, which has demonstrated promise in enhancing both runtime efficiency and memory utilization during mining tasks. Nevertheless, this innovation has thus far found application exclusively in clickstream mining and sequential pattern mining contexts.In this paper, we propose an extension of this data structure for the mining of frequent inter-sequence patterns and introduce a novel algorithm named Inter-Sequence Pattern mining based on Pseudo-Index. Additionally, our proposed algorithm incorporates a pruning method known as Inter-Sequence Pattern Mining with Index Inter-section Checking, designed to effectively curtail the proliferation of generated candidates. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that the proposed algorithm excels in processing time and storage space utilization when compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms designed for mining inter-sequence patterns.

AB Chest radiography (CXR) is a popular imaging modality for screening lung abnormalities. It plays a vital role in monitoring disease progression, allocating limited medical resources effectively, and planning treatment in clinical practice. However, manual CXR image screening is time-consuming and susceptible to human errors. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can be an additional decision-making tool for radiologists. Although prior research had remarkable success in COVID-19 classification tasks, it is still difficult to accurately localize the infection and quantify its severity, which restricts the generalizability and interpretability of CAD-based systems. This work proposes an end-to-end multi-stage architecture for COVID-19 classification, infection region identification, and disease severity assessment. The first stage of the proposed architecture identifies the relevant lung regions by eliminating the irrelevant portions. The second stage discriminates COVID-19 from pneumonia and normal images. In this study, instead of a single pre-trained model, we used three models and a fuzzy rank-based ensemble method to combine the results. Unlike the simple ensemble techniques, the proposed approach generates the final predictions for the test samples by evaluating the confidence in the predictions of the base models. In the final stage of the network, the infection regions are identified, and the amount of infection is calculated when the image is classified as COVID-19. Subsequently, a severity score ranging from 0 to 3 is assigned based on the level of infection severity. Based on the predicted scores, COVID-19 images are categorized into four severity levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The final ensemble segmentation model exceeds all the individual segmentation models with an IoU score of 98.99% and a dice score of 99.49%. Additionally, the infection segmentation model also outperforms all other segmentation models individually, achieving a dice score of 96.75% and an IoU score of 93.71%. Our proposed segmentation-based classification model achieves a maximum accuracy of 98.05% with an F1-score of 97.76% and outperforms five state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN models and five existing ensemble techniques in the literature. An external dataset also validated the model, and the results showed an accuracy of 97.63% and an F1-score of 97.22%.

AB The explosive growth of software vulnerabilities poses a serious threat to the system security and has become one of the urgent problems of the day. However, existing vulnerability detection methods are still faced with limitations in reaching the balance between detection accuracy, efficiency and applicability. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, this paper proposes TrVD (abstract syntax Tree decomposition based Vulnerability Detector) to disclose the indicative semantics implied in the source code fragments for accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. To facilitate the capture of subtle semantic features, TrVD converts the AST of a code fragment into an ordered set of sub-trees of restricted sizes and depths with a novel decomposition algorithm. The semantics of each sub-tree can thus be effectively collected with a carefully designed tree-structured neural network. Finally, a Transformer-style encoder is utilized to aggregate the long-range contextual semantics of all sub-trees into a vulnerability-specific vector to represent the target code fragment. The extensive experiments conducted on five large datasets consisting of diverse real-world and synthetic vulnerable samples demonstrate the performance superiority of TrVD against SOTA approaches in detecting the presence of vulnerabilities and pinpointing the vulnerability types. The ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of TrVD's core designs.

TI Estimating package arrival time via heterogeneous hypergraph neural
   network
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Estimated time of arrival; Hypergraph neural network; Transformer
AB Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for packages plays an essential role in intelligent logistics. As a classic ETA method, Origin-Destination-based (OD-based) ETA predicts the delivery time only based on the attributes (i.e., sender address, receiver address, seller, and payment time) of packages under the condition that the delivery route is unavailable. However, existing OD-based methods only exploit attributes associated with an individual order, which fails to model the higher-order interactions within orders and attributes, and fail to sufficiently exploit the graph-structure knowledge (i.e., relation of orders and attributes) and feature-based knowledge (i.e., statistical properties) of orders simultaneously, resulting in inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous HyperGraph Neural Network (H2GNN) for estimating package arrival time. Specifically, to better capture the high-order interactions within orders and attributes, we construct an order heterogeneous hypergraph that utilizes hyperedges to represent orders and nodes to represent order attributes. Besides, we extend the hypergraph learning for large-scale e-commerce data by Hyper-GraphSAGE. Overall, H2GNN can provide informatively representations of packages while preserving both structure-based knowledge learned by hypergraph and feature-based knowledge captured by Transformer. Experimental results on large-scale Alibaba logistics data demonstrate the superior performance of H2GNN compared to the baselines.

AB We study the machine learning task for models with operators mapping between the Wasserstein space of probability measures and a space of functions, like e.g. in mean-field games/control problems. Two classes of neural networks based on bin density and on cylindrical approximation, are proposed to learn these so-called mean-field functions, and are theoretically supported by universal approximation theorems. We perform several numerical experiments for training these two mean-field neural networks, and show their accuracy and efficiency in the generalization error with various test distributions. Finally, we present different algorithms relying on mean-field neural networks for solving time-dependent mean-field problems, and illustrate our results with numerical tests for the example of a semi-linear partial differential equation in the Wasserstein space of probability measures.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID APPROXIMATION; CAPABILITIES
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular choice for analyzing graph data in the last few years, and characterizing their expressiveness has become an active area of research. One popular measure of expressiveness is the number of linear regions in neural networks with piecewise linear activations. In this paper, we present estimates for the number of linear regions in classic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with one layer and multiple-layer scenarios and ReLU activation function. We derive an optimal upper bound for the maximum number of linear regions for one-layer GCNs and upper and lower bounds for multi-layer GCNs. Our simulated results suggest that the true maximum number of linear regions is likely closer to our estimated lower bound. These findings indicate that multi-layer GCNs have exponentially greater expressivity than one-layer GCNs per parameter, implying that deeper GCNs are more expressive than their shallow counterparts.

AB Minimum error entropy with fiducial points (MEEF) has received a lot of attention, due to its outstanding performance to curb the negative influence caused by non-Gaussian noises in the fields of machine learning and signal processing. However, the estimate of the information potential of MEEF involves a double summation operator based on all available error samples, which can result in large computational burden in many practical scenarios. In this paper, an efficient quantization method is therefore adopted to represent the primary set of error samples with a smaller subset, generating a quantized MEEF (QMEEF). Some basic properties of QMEEF are presented and proved from theoretical perspectives. In addition, we have applied this new criterion to train a class of linear-in-parameters models, including the commonly used linear regression model, random vector functional link network, and broad learning system as special cases. Experimental results on various datasets are reported to demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed methods to perform regression tasks with contaminated data.

   spiking neural networks based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity

DT Article
DE Spiking neural network; Spike-timing-dependent plasticity; Supervised
   learning
ID ARCHITECTURE; RESUME
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a viable alternative to conventional artificial neural networks when resource efficiency and computational complexity are of importance. A major advantage of SNNs is their binary information transfer through spike trains which eliminates multiplication operations. The training of SNNs has, however, been a challenge, since neuron models are non-differentiable and traditional gradient -based backpropagation algorithms cannot be applied directly. Furthermore, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), albeit being a spike-based learning rule, updates weights locally and does not optimize for the output error of the network. We present desire backpropagation, a method to derive the desired spike activity of all neurons, including the hidden ones, from the output error. By incorporating this desire value into the local STDP weight update, we can efficiently capture the neuron dynamics while minimizing the global error and attaining a high classification accuracy. That makes desire backpropagation a spike-based supervised learning rule. We trained three-layer networks to classify MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images and reached an accuracy of 98.41% and 87.56%, respectively. In addition, by eliminating a multiplication during the backward pass, we reduce computational complexity and balance arithmetic resources between forward and backward pass, making desire backpropagation a candidate for training on low-resource devices.

DE Natural language generation; Text style transfer; Unsupervised learning;
   Disentanglement; Adversarial training
AB Text style transfer is the task of altering the style of a source text to a desired style while preserving the style-independent content. A common approach involves disentangling a given sentence into a style-agnostic content representation within the latent space and then generating the text in the desired style, guided by a separate style embedding. However, previous methods have a limitation in that they assume the input sentence is encoded by a fix-sized latent vector at the sentence level, making it challenging to capture rich semantic information at the token level, especially when dealing with longer texts. Consequently, this leads to suboptimal preservation of non-stylistic semantic content. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose TED, a fine-grained model for disentangling content and style representation at the token level to enhance content preservation. Specifically, TED use tf-idfs to estimate the pivot tokens for different styles and incorporates multi-task and adversarial objectives to disentangle the content and style information of each token within the latent space. Experimental results on two popular text style transfer datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in terms of content preservation. Moreover, the quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in achieving token-level disentanglement within the latent space.

A novel class of distributed group consensus protocols is designed by combining current and outdated states of agents, which differs from the standard one using only current states. Sufficient conditions for group consensus are derived for MASs without two conservative assumptions required by previous literature. The proposed protocol can accelerate the convergence speed of MASs by choosing appropriate outdated states. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

DE Visual object tracking; Transformer; Axial attention; Deep learning
AB Transformer has been widely applied to visual tracking tasks, and the performance of object tracking keeps getting better since the attention mechanism excels in capturing long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms can only capture feature dependencies from a single dimension, limiting their ability to fully leverage the spatial position information that is critical for accurate target localization. In this work, we propose a novel axial attention mechanism that is specifically designed for object tracking tasks that require precise target positioning. The axial attention mechanism utilizes both row attention and column attention, enabling it to capture global feature dependencies from both dimensions. Additionally, we propose a low-complexity yet highly effective feature fusion network that employs a customized dual attention mixing strategy. Our CRTrack outperforms all state-of-the-art trackers on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, and UAV123, demonstrating the superiority of the framework. Notably, the MACs and Params of our proposed feature fusion network are only 40% and 24% of those of the Transformer-based feature fusion network, respectively.

ID DATA PLACEMENT STRATEGY; OPTIMIZATION
AB With the deployment of workflow and other applications, cloud computing is accessible and offers assistance for optimizing workflow execution and enhancing performance. Existing research, however, tends to disregard the influence of dataset migration on workflow execution and focuses more on task execution time. This study suggests a new model for the problem of data-intensive workflow execution. Firstly, according to the structure of the workflow scheduling problem, it is divided into two sub-problems: data placement and task scheduling. The two sub-problems interact with each other and a bi-level optimum model is established. By seeking a better allocation strategy for the dataset placement and then seeking the best task-scheduling solution. Secondly, an improved multitasking bi-level evolutionary algorithm (IM-BLEA) is proposed. When dealing with the lower-level optimization problem (LLOP), offspring are selected by sorting individuals by their performance and overall performance in the population, and this environmental selection enhances the diversity and searchability of the population. Finally, compared with the other multitasking algorithm, IM-BLEA has good performance. Simulation results based on real scientific workflows show that the algorithm improves the values of transfer time and number of selected data centers by 56% and 10% compared to the comparison algorithm.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Santiago Urban Dataset SUD is a real dataset that combines Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and Handheld Mobile Laser Scanning (HMLS) point clouds. The data is composed by 2 km of streets, sited in Santiago de Compostela (Spain). Point clouds undergo a manual labelling process supported by both heuristic and Deep Learning methods, resulting in the classification of eight specific classes: road, sidewalk, curb, buildings, vehicles, vegetation, poles, and others. Three PointNet++ models were trained; the first one using MLS point clouds, the second one with HMLS point clouds and the third one with both H&MLS point clouds. In order to ascertain the quality and efficacy of each Deep Learning model, various metrics were employed, including confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results are consistent with other state-of-the-art works and indicate that SUD is valid for comparing point cloud semantic segmentation works. Furthermore, the survey's extensive coverage and the limited occlusions indicate the potential utility of SUD in urban mobility research.

ID POSE ESTIMATION
AB Several learning-based methods dedicated to 3D point cloud registration have been developed recently. However, the performance of such methods is limited due to a lack of effective feature interaction mechanisms. To overcome this problem, an iteration-based interactive attention network is proposed here for 3D point cloud registration that can effectively learn the overlapping features of point cloud pairs and improve the registration accuracy. Concretely, we first designed a condensed global information extractor to achieve aggregated global features. Meanwhile, to reduce the amount of calculation required for subsequent modules while maintaining high-level characteristic information, the number of point cloud features is reduced. Furthermore, an overlapping feature iterative attention module and a discriminant feature iterative expansion module are designed. The main function of both modules is to implement feature interaction in the form of cross-attention and self-attention as well as to deepen interactions iteratively. The former captures overlapping information by iteratively interacting with the features of the condensed global features of one point cloud and the local geometric features of another point cloud. The latter can expand the number of features back to the initial number of point clouds through the interaction of overlapping features and local geometric features. Finally, matching features with high discriminative ability are obtained and used to formulate a soft correspondence matrix. Furthermore, weighted singular-value decomposition is adopted to obtain the rigid transformation matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

   DESIGN
AB Kriging surrogate model has been widely used to simulate expensive models in engineering application. Ensemble of multi-kernel Kriging surrogate models can integrate the information of different kernel functions and enhance the predictive robustness. The performance of the ensemble Kriging model is dependent on the collection of samples. However, the traditional sampling methods primarily concentrate on the accuracy of individual-kernel Kriging, disregarding the difference among different kernel functions. To deal with the issue of sample selection in the context of ensemble Kriging, a regional discrepancy and space-filling criteria-based hybrid sampling (RSHS) method is proposed in this paper. According to the bias-variance decomposition, the expected leave-one-out cross validation error is introduced to compute the weight of each Kriging component. Considering the disagreement of different kernel-based Kriging models, the combination of regional correlation and regional predictive error is derived to measure the regional discrepancy for pursuing local accuracy. The space-filling criterion is also employed to ensure the even coverage across the entire space for global exploration. Therefore, the hybrid sampling criterion is developed to select sample point sequentially by maximizing the regional discrepancy with subject to the constraint of space-filling criterion. The performance of the proposed method is validated by six benchmark examples and an engineering application of airfoil shape model. The results demonstrate the RSHS sampling method can provide promising accuracy and robustness for ensemble Kriging metamodeling.

AB Embodied simulation with a digital brain model and a realistic musculoskeletal body model provides a means to understand animal behavior and behavioral change. Such simulation can be too large and complex to conduct on a single computer, and so distributed simulation across multiple computers over the Internet is necessary. In this study, we report our joint effort on developing a spiking brain model and a mouse body model, connecting over the Internet, and conducting bidirectional simulation while synchronizing them. Specifically, the brain model consisted of multiple regions including secondary motor cortex, primary motor and somatosensory cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and thalamus, whereas the mouse body model, provided by the Neurorobotics Platform of the Human Brain Project, had a movable forelimb with three joints and six antagonistic muscles to act in a virtual environment. Those were simulated in a distributed manner across multiple computers including the supercomputer Fugaku, which is the flagship supercomputer in Japan, while communicating via Robot Operating System (ROS). To incorporate models written in C/C++ in the distributed simulation, we developed a C++ version of the rosbridge library from scratch, which has been released under an open source license. These results provide necessary tools for distributed embodied simulation, and demonstrate its possibility and usefulness toward understanding animal behavior and behavioral change.

AB Cloud computing offers opportunities to increase productivity and reduce costs. Quickly adapting to changing needs is key to maintaining cloud applications. In traditional development, coordination is implemented in computational code. Although change impact analyses are studied, adjusting the implementation is time-consuming and error-prone when the coordination strategy changes. Exogenous coordination separates the implemented coordination and computational code to cope with this problem. This separation improves the reusability of components. Additionally, other applications with similar interaction patterns can reuse the coordination specification. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a methodology to develop and maintain cloud applications following the exogenous approach. To illustrate the idea, we introduce a new framework named OCCIwareBIP, which integrates JavaBIP - a framework for the exogenous coordination of concurrent Java components into OCCIware - a framework for designing cloud applications. We also leverage the coordination model to verify the deadlock-freedom of the cloud application. Finally, we present an application to show the ability of our approach to guarantee the safety and benefits of modularization in developing concurrent cloud applications.

AB Purpose. The purpose of this study is to compare two libraries dedicated to the Markov chain Monte Carlo method: pystan and numpyro. In the comparison, we mainly focused on the agreement of estimated latent parameters and the performance of sampling using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in Bayesian item response Materials and methods. Bayesian 1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT were implemented with pystan and numpyro. Then, the Bayesian 1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT were applied to two types of medical data obtained from a published article. The same prior distributions of latent parameters were used in both pystan and numpyro. Estimation results of latent parameters of 1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT were compared between pystan and numpyro. Additionally, the computational cost of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method was compared between the two libraries. To evaluate the computational cost of IRT models, simulation data were generated from the medical data and numpyro. Results. For all the combinations of IRT types (1PL-IRT or 2PL-IRT) and medical data types, the mean and standard deviation of the estimated latent parameters were in good agreement between pystan and numpyro. In most cases, the sampling time using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method was shorter in numpyro than that in pystan. When the large-sized simulation data were used, numpyro with a graphics processing unit was useful for reducing the sampling time. Conclusion. Numpyro and pystan were useful for applying the Bayesian 1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT. Our results show that the two libraries yielded similar estimation result and that regarding to sampling time, the fastest libraries differed based on the dataset size.

To combine the two processes of padding and clustering and improve the clustering accuracy, a generalized fuzzy clustering framework is proposed based on optimal completion strategy (OCS) and nearest prototype strategy (NPS) with four improved algorithms developed. Feature weights are introduced to reduce outliers' influence on the cluster centers, and kernel functions are used to solve the linear indistinguishability problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated regarding correct clustering rate, iteration number, and external evaluation indexes with nine datasets from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository. The results of the experiment indicate that the clustering accuracy of the feature weighted kernel fuzzy C-means algorithm with NPS (NPS-WKFCM) and feature weighted kernel fuzzy C-means algorithm with OCS (OCS-WKFCM) under varying missing rates is superior to that of seven conventional algorithms. Experiments demonstrate that the enhanced algorithm proposed for clustering incomplete data is superior.

AB Aerial gaze target recognition is an important step in aerial eye control interaction. In order to achieve accurate aerial gaze target recognition, the VT4LM recognition algorithm was constructed in this paper. By this algorithm, the facial images containing the eyes of the flight operators were first inputted into Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the local features, and the head posture of the flight operators was inputted into four LSTMs to extract the global features. Then, the local and global features of the flight operators were inputted into three fully connected layers, two dropout layers and one softmax classifier. Finally, the recognition result of aerial gaze target was obtained. In this paper the effectiveness of the VT4LM recognition algorithm was verified through the identification of four aerial line-of-sight gaze targets named Head-up display, Accelerator push rod, Control lever and Rudder by four flight operators during simulated flight. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the VT4LM algorithm for aerial gaze target recognition reached 89.29% and the Cross Entropy Loss was 1.45. Compared to the other three recognition methods, the VT4LM algorithm had the highest recognition accuracy and minimum loss. When using the VT4LM algorithm to detect four simulated flight operators staring at four aerial gaze targets, the recognition accuracy was all higher than 85.00%. It could be seen that the VT4LM algorithm had a good performance in aerial gaze target recognition.

AB The introduction of a multi-population structure in differential evolution (DE) algorithm has been proven to be an effective way to achieve algorithm adaptation and multi-strategy integration. However, in existing studies, the mutation strategy selection of each subpopulation during execution is fixed, resulting in poor self-adaptation of subpopulations. To solve this problem, a dynamic multi-strategy integrated differential evolution algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RLDMDE) is proposed in this paper. By employing reinforcement learning, each subpopulation can adaptively select the mutation strategy according to the current environmental state (population diversity). Based on the population state, this paper proposes an individual dynamic migration strategy to "reward" or "punish" the population to avoid wasting individual computing resources. Furthermore, this paper applies two methods of good point set and random opposition-based learning (ROBL) in the population initialization stage to improve the quality of the initial solutions. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the RLDMDE algorithm, this paper selects two benchmark function sets, CEC2013 and CEC2017, and six engineering design problems for testing. The results demonstrate that the RLDMDE algorithm has good performance and strong competitiveness in solving optimization problems.

AB Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are increasing in product recommendation decisions, which typically entail several factors. This study aims to demonstrate the application of a novel strategy based on MCDM techniques as the core element of a consumer Decision Support System by suggesting the most appropriate items from a given set of alternatives. Ranking products based on online product ratings and consumer preferences is an important area of study, but there are currently few studies on this topic. This paper proposes a method for ranking products using multi-attribute online ratings. We propose a novel mobile recommendation-ranking system-based (MCDM) method to recommend the best alternative. Our proposed model differs from previous works in the following ways: (a) Rating information of each feature is used to identify user preferences and complementary criteria; (b) Criteria weights are determined by Shannon entropy (c) The complex proportional assessment method is employed to rank the alternatives and solve the best mobile recommendation problem. (d) The sensitivity study results showed that the rankings produced by the various MCDM approaches were highly consistent with the rankings of the evaluated compromise candidates. Demonstration of the proposed approach through a mobile phone selection case study. In our experiments, we have found that our approach provides a reliable ranking while reducing time and space complexity, indicating that our optimization model is accurate and efficient. With its superior product comparison skills and ability to offer a recommendation to the user as a final ranking of alternatives, a decision-making system like this may prove to be the optimal long-term answer for e-commerce sites and websites.

ID SLEEP-APNEA
AB The health-care industry is seeing a dynamic ease of use of low-cost issue solutions that improve patient care, cut down on problems, increase efficacy, and provide health-care decision-makers access to intelligence information at the point of treatment. During sleep, breathing and apnea are recorded using a non-invasive sleeping breath monitoring system (NSBS), which is suggested in this study. The system gathers information about the movement of the chest and abdomen while sleeping around the pressure-sensitive sensor belt, determines the type of breathing being done, records the presence of apnea, and transmits the information wirelessly via Bluetooth to a mobile device. Real-time waveforms may be drawn and displayed by the mobile app, and the data can subsequently be uploaded to a cloud platform by the mobile device. To enable user sleep nursing monitoring, the PC terminal downloads data from the cloud to create the waveform and show the respiratory status record when the user is sleeping. Getting the pressure signal produced by the body's movement while you sleep is the fundamental tenet of the non-invasive sleep monitoring system. The FSR408 piezoresistive sensor from Interlink is utilized in this design. The sensor is 600-mm long, 16-mm wide, and 1-mm thick. The sensor's maximum range is 10 kg, its precision in force resolution is greater than 0.5%, and its reaction time is 1-2 ms, which satisfies the requirements for the acquisition of various metrics when a person is asleep. When computing the typical breathing signal, the algorithm's correlation degree similarity is greater than 90%. When an apnea frame is discovered, the resemblance to the usual frame is noticeably decreased, and the lesser the similarity, the longer the apnea period.

AB In this work, the researchers looked into how fiber Bragg grating (FBG) techniques and predistortion devices affected front-haul radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems' optical millimeter wave (mm-wave) transmission. The major goal was to develop a low-cost, high-performance RoF mm-wave-based system that could transmit baseband signals at various rates (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 Gbps) and frequencies (15, 30, 60, and 65 GHz) using a single dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM). To maximize power efficiency and address non-linearity difficulties in the RoF connection, the predistortion approach was used to improve the linearity of transmitter amplifiers. In the study, both return-to-zero (RZ) and non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pulse generators were put to the test. A single-mode fiber (SMF) with FBG and an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) were utilized to correct for link dispersion. An optical Gaussian filter (GOF) was used at the far terminal to reduce signal attenuation and set a bandwidth restriction for the received signal. In accordance with the results of the simulations, a 140 km fiber connection operating at 5 Gbps with a 15 GHz local oscillator and a 60 GHz mm-wave was able to achieve a Q-factor of roughly 8.67 and a bit error rate (BER) of 2.05E-18. The results also showed that a 130 GHz mm-wave with a Q-factor of 7.4, and BER of 5.08E-14 was produced with fiber length of 140 km and a data rate of 1 Gbps.

AB The main need of people during natural disasters, such as earthquakes, is to have a safe shelter. Since it is not possible to provide suitable places immediately after the occurrence of crises, such as earthquakes, it is necessary to identify safe places for accommodation before such crises occur. Failure to identify effective criteria in locating aid centers and failure to evaluate the effect of each criterion in selecting optimal centers will pose new and irreparable challenges to crisis management in crisis situations. In this research, 18 criteria were collected and evaluated by experts to assess relief centers. Thirty locations, considered by crisis management, were evaluated using geographic information systems. After creating information layers and a matrix of paired comparisons resulting from the evaluation of relief centers in relation to the problem's criteria, the research criteria were weighted. Then, using the fuzzy cognitive mapping method and after analyzing the correlation of the criteria, the effectiveness and influence of each location criterion in the occurrence of a crisis were evaluated, and the weight of each criterion was determined. By applying the weights obtained from the two methods, the relief centers were ranked separately in each stage using the PROMETHEE method. Distance from the fault (17%), distance from worn-out tissue (12%), and distance from educational centers (1%) had the highest and least impact on the ranking of the options, respectively. In addition, criteria such as distance to the river, population, and distance to medical centers have been the most effective criteria compared to others for locating relief centers. Finally, the Borda and Copeland methods were used to combine the ranking results and determine the final priority of options, and the results indicated both similar and different performances of some options in the final ranking. The use of the fuzzy mapping method to calculate the weight of the criteria for ranking relief centers and determining effective and efficient criteria in locating relief centers is one of the contributions of this research. Furthermore, evaluating the effectiveness and value of location criteria in the event of an earthquake crisis is another innovation of this research.

AB Supply chain network design (SCND) problems are essential in formulating strategic decisions on the number of facilities, network facility location, and plant capacity, to ensure the optimal delivery of products from manufacturers to end consumers. On the other hand, assembly line balancing (ALB) problems provide details on operational decisions which encompass production levels and inventories and therefore should be flexible enough to react when changes in resource availability and product demands occur. This study develops a novel combination of these independent problems as a multi-objective SCND-ALB problem which considers economic, environmental, and social objectives in determining the optimal design and operational conditions of the supply chain which consists of U-shaped assembly lines. Furthermore, the normal type belief degree-based uncertainty is considered to reflect the uncertainty of the parameters of the problem. The uncertain formulation is crisped using two different approaches. Then, two multi-objective solution approaches of the literature such as TH and GCM approaches are considered to simultaneously account for the three sustainability objectives of the obtained crisp multi-objective formulations. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the problem in detail. Furthermore, several test problems are used to compare the performance of the solution approaches. Based on the obtained results, the TH approach performs better in 100% of the experiments.

AB Rough sets offer an efficient mathematical framework to formalize the process of data analysis and knowledge discovery in the presence of incomplete or uncertain information. The hybridization of rough sets with other mathematical structures is a significant tool to tackle ambiguity and obscurity as compared to a single mathematical approach. The integration of rough sets with other extensions of fuzzy sets provides a way to deal with the complexity and uncertainty of real-world decision-making problems. Similarity measures can be discussed more accurately when lower and upper approximate values of a crisp set are to be dealt with Pythagorean fuzzy information. In this research, a hybrid model is developed by assimilating the concept of rough approximations with various similarity measures under Pythagorean fuzzy information. Upper and lower approximation operators for a Pythagorean fuzzy set are defined. Several types of similarity measures between Pythagorean fuzzy rough sets including, cotangent, cosine, sine and tangent similarity measures and their important properties are discussed in detail. The similarity measures are also extended using different configuration parameters. We exhibit the efficiency of the suggested similarity measures using various measurement parameters. Different types of weighted similarity measures are defined using Pythagorean fuzzy rough sets. Comparison between all similarity measures is discussed to notice which similarity measure provides more precise results. The significance of the presented similarity measures is studied with an application to recognize the pattern of COVID-19 spread and its impacts in different countries. A comparative analysis of the impact of COVID-19 spread in ten different countries with existing techniques is given and explained using numerical tables and graphs. The main advantages and out-performance of the suggested approaches are highlighted in detail.

AB In order to improve the effect of short video transmission, this paper constructs the overall performance model of the node based on DNC theory. DNC theory is based on the mathematical foundation of minimal plus algebra. Moreover, it analyzes network QoS through two basic tools: arrival curve and service curve, and finds the upper bound of network performance parameters based on network behavior. In addition, it implements the problem of task offloading in fog computing, and needs to calculate the definite boundary of the network delay, backlog and other parameters in the worst case, which is convenient for the realization of the MOTO and GOMOTO algorithms. Finally, this paper combines the Internet of Things technology and short video transmission methods to construct a short video transmission model based on the Internet of Things node technology, and designs experiments to verify the effects of the model proposed in this paper. It can be seen from the experimental research that the IoT node technology proposed in this paper can effectively improve the effect of short video transmission and effectively increase the speed of short video transmission.

AB Video action recognition needs to model any differences by subdividing the spatio-temporal features to distinguish various actions. We propose rethinking spatio-temporal cross attention transformer (STAR++), a multi-modal transformer-based model that uses both RGB and skeleton information as an extended version of STAR-Transformer. STAR++ unifies the encoder-decoder structure of the base spatio-temporal cross attention transformer (STAR-Transformer) into an encoder structure and applies a new method of using interval attention as spatio-temporal cross attention. STAR++ provides interval attention from local features to global features as the layer deepens, allowing it to learn appropriately based on the transformer properties, improving the performance. In addition, STAR++ additionally proposes a deformable 3D token selection that can dynamically select and learn tokens for an attention operation such that tokens can be efficiently learned. The proposed STAR++ demonstrated competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art models using Penn action and NTU-RGB+D 60, 120, which are action recognition benchmark datasets. In addition, an ablation study was conducted to confirm that each proposed module has an essential effect on the performance improvement.

ID E-LEARNING SYSTEM
AB Estimating the difficulty of a question in video QAs is one of the important reasoning steps to answer the question. However, no previous question difficulty estimators consider the association between multiple modalities though video QA is intrinsically a multi-modal task involving both text and video. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel question difficulty estimator using an enhanced directional modality attention transformer (DiMAT++). The proposed estimator adopts a CNN backbone network and a transformer to express a video modality and RoBERTa to express a text modality. However, these modalities are insufficient to classify the difficulty level of a question correctly, since they affect each other during performing video QAs. Therefore, in the proposed estimator, DiMAT++ captures directional associations from text modality to video modality and vice versa. DiMAT, the previous version of DiMAT++, does not represent the sequential information for each modality though it is designed to express the directional associations. Thus, DiMAT++ revises it to accept the sequential representations of each modality as its input. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is verified with two benchmark video QA data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed estimator outperforms three baselines of heterogeneous attention mechanism (HAM), multi-modal fusion transformer (MMFT), and DiMAT, which proves that DiMAT++ is effective in improving the performance of video question difficulty estimation.

ID OPTIMIZATION; DEEP
AB An automatic alpha factor mining method is proposed in this paper to assist expert traders in finding profitable alpha factors efficiently. Unlike finding qualified alpha factors by directly enumerating all possible combinations, the mining task is formulated as an iterative convolution kernel learning problem. Each kernel to be learned is associated with a unique alpha factor. To better solve the learning problem, the sparsity is introduced at the mutation step of the learning process to find simple and interpretable solutions efficiently and relieve the overfitting risks in real-world trading. A theorem is proposed to prove that the designed learning process can complete automatically in finite iterations as all convolution kernel vectors converge to zero vectors. In addition, a score function based on win rate, expected return and trade frequency is designed to evaluate the performance of market entry signals generated by the alpha factors practically. The convolution kernels with high score values are recorded and exported as the mined alpha factors. The experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance on both the China government bond dataset and the gold dataset.

AB Online shopping has become an essential part of modern life, with food delivery being one of the most popular services. In this study, we investigate the factors influencing customers' preferences in online food ordering, such as easy payment, customization, and fast delivery. Analysing customer ratings and reviews is crucial in ensuring the quality of food services and promoting a healthy lifestyle. However, the trustworthiness of online reviews remains a challenge. Based on their rating, new customers can get help from online shoppers for their preferences or demands. Data are collected from customer reviews through online platforms to improve food service quality in online shopping. This work aims to predict the preferences of customers in online shopping based on optimized feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis with a Social Spider Optimization (PCA-SSO) algorithm. Despite existing algorithms for analysing customer preferences, most may have inaccurate predictions or take time to analyse data. To overcome these challenges, this model of PCA-SSO is proposed to predict customers' more accurate online shopping preferences. This model provides valuable implications for online shopping owners regarding customer satisfaction. Compared to the accuracy rates of KNN (78.22%), LDA (83.16%), and PCA (88.56%) algorithms, our proposed algorithm of PCA-SSO achieved a higher accuracy of 93.54%.

AB Community detection plays an important role in analyzing attributed networks. It attempts to find the optimal cluster structures to identify valuable information. Although deep nonnegative matrix factorization (DNMF) is widely used in community detection, it cannot be used to analyze attributed networks since only topology information is considered. Recent researches have taken attribute information into account, but we still need to face the following challenges. First, it is difficult to deal with topology noise and attribute noise in attributed networks at one stroke. Second, we need to balance the coupling between topology and node attributes with hyperparameters in most methods. However, with inappropriate hyperparameters, it is easy to cause interference and compromise between them. For the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel method, namely adaptive deep nonnegative matrix factorization. Specifically, we handle the inherent noise of attributed networks via dual-DNMF with autoencoder. And then, we use the attention mechanism to adaptively integrate topology information and attribute information without adjusting hyperparameters manually. Overall, our method not only handles the inherent noise in attributed networks, but also resolves the interference and compromise between topology and attributes in a generalized way. The results of comprehensive experiments support our conclusions and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most datasets.

AB In permanent magnet linear synchronous motor systems, the nonlinear system functions in the dynamic model are difficult to obtain accurately, which leads to the reduction of system control performance. In this paper, an adaptive recurrent neural network intelligent sliding mode control (ARNISMC) strategy is proposed. The sliding mode controller is designed to improve the robustness of the system. Secondly, considering the nonlinear system function in the dynamic model of linear motor, it is approximated by recursive radial basis function neural network (RRBFNN). Then, the weight of RRBFNN is learned online by the adaptive algorithm and the approximation error of the nonlinear function is robustly compensated. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed ARNISMC not only achieves strong robustness, but also has better control accuracy than the original sliding mode control and radial basis function neural network sliding mode control method. In addition, it also shows the advantages of intelligent control.

   network; Crossover method; 2D chromosome
AB Ceramic tile industry is facing significant challenges in the industrial revolution 4.0. Most of the ceramic tile factories are under backward technologies, especially in the developing countries. Due to their complicated process and current technologies, there are many surface defects occurring on the final products. Classifying and grading the product still relies on humans which has caused many problems. Hence, developing an optimal model to deal with this surface defect detection and classification automatically is necessary for these companies. This study aims to propose a two-dimensional genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (2DG-CNN) which can automatically generate an optimal convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting and classifying the defect products. In particular, a general CNN structure is firstly determined including the number of convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. A two-dimensional chromosome is designed to represent a CNN model efficiently. In addition, a novel matrix crossover is developed to create more diversified offspring. A database of ceramic tile surface images is constructed to validate the proposed approach. The 2DG-CNN was compared with the other well-known algorithms. The results have shown the efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB To solve the recommendation accuracy degradation problem encountered in sequential recommendation cases caused by data sparsity-such as short historical user behaviour sequences and limited information-this paper proposes a sequential recommendation model based on multipair contrastive learning with informative augmentation (IA-MPCL). The model aims to better learn user preference representations. Initially, a self-attention network is utilized to maintain the intrinsic relevance of the original sequences and introduce virtual interaction items for short sequences to achieve informative enhancement. Subsequently, multiple positive samples are generated by data augmentation methods to form multiple pairs of positive and negative samples. A multipair contrastive loss is constructed to eliminate the negative impact of fake positive and negative samples on the training process of the self-attention network. Finally, an adaptive loss weighting mechanism is proposed to dynamically regulate the role of the contrastive loss during multitask training. Through comparison experiments involving baseline methods and experiments conducted on datasets with different sparsity levels, the results show that IA-MPCL achieves significant improvements in terms of both recommendation accuracy and data sparsity resistance.

TI Multi-Modal Meta-Transfer Fusion Network for Few-Shot 3D Model

DE 3D model classification; Multi-modal; Multi-view; Point cloud
AB Nowadays, driven by the increasing concern on 3D techniques, resulting in the large-scale 3D data, 3D model classification has attracted enormous attention from both research and industry communities. Most of the current methods highly depend on sufficient labeled 3D models, which substantially restricts their scalability to novel classes with few annotated training data since it can increase the chance of overfitting. Besides, they only leverage single-modal information (either point cloud or multi-view information), and few works integrate these complementary information for 3D model representation. To overcome these problems, we propose a multi-modal meta-transfer fusion network (M3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{3}$$\end{document}TF), the key of which is to perform few-shot multi-modal representation for 3D model classification. Specifically, we first convert the original 3D data into both multi-view and point cloud modalities, and pre-train individual encoding networks on a large-scale dataset to obtain the optimal initial parameters, which is beneficial to few-shot learning tasks. Then, to enable the network to adjust to few-shot learning tasks, we update the parameters in Scaling and Shifting operation (SS), multi-modal representation fusion (MMRF) and the 3D model classifier to obtain optimal initialization parameters. Since the large-scale training parameters in feature extractors will increase the chance of overfitting, we freeze the feature extractor and introduce a SS operation to adjust its weights. Specifically, SS can reduce the number of training parameters up to 20%, which can effectively avoid overfitting. MMRF can adaptively integrate the multi-modal information based on their significance to the 3D model for a more robust 3D representation. Since there is no available dataset for evaluation, we build three 3D CAD datasets, Meta-ModalNet, Meta-ShapeNet and Meta-RGBD, for this new task and implement the representative methods for fair comparisons. Extensive experimental results can demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

AB Pneumatic soft actuators possess relatively fast response, inherent high flexibility, and achieve extraordinary shape morphing under large deformations. Conventionally, the entire body of soft pneumatic robots needs to be designed for specific applications. Herein, a soft pneumatic actuator design with structured fabrics as actuator skins, which has high bending stiffness variation that can accomplish multiple tasks and different deformation modes in a single body, is proposed. By adjusting the structured skin, the developed soft actuator can be tailored to achieve various deformations. It is experimentally shown that the bending stiffness of the actuator can be adjusted from 108 to 5654 N m-1. The blocking force of the actuator in bending is comparable with that of conventional fabric-reinforced pneumatic actuators, while the actuator skins are reusable and programmable. In application, the actuators are used to construct a bionic soft gripper with multiple degrees of freedom. By switching between three grasping modes, the gripper successfully fulfills a series of tasks including lifting weights up to 1 kg and grasping objects ranging from a grain of grape to a large iron basin. This work opens up an avenue for designing structured skins for pneumatic robots with programmable deformation modes and versatile functions.
   Herein, a new class of soft pneumatic actuators with tunable bending stiffness, tailored deformation shapes, and considerable output force based on a wearable structured skin is designed, fabricated, and used to construct a soft gripper with multiple degrees of freedom.

AB For targeted transport in the body, biomedical microbots (mu bots) must move effectively in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. Swimming mu bots translate via asymmetric or screw-like motions while rolling ones use friction with available surfaces to generate propulsive forces. Previously the authors have shown that planar rotating magnetic fields assemble mu m-scale superparamagnetic beads into circular mu bots that roll along surfaces. In this, gravity is required to pull mu bots near the surface; however, this is not necessarily practical in complex geometries. Here, the authors show that rotating magnetic fields, in tandem with directional magnetic gradient forces, can be used to roll mu bots on surfaces regardless of orientation. Simplifying implementation, a spinning permanent magnet is used to generate differing ratios of rotating and gradient fields, optimizing control for different environments. This use of a single magnetic actuator sidesteps the need for complex electromagnet or tandem field setups, removes requisite gravitational load forces, and enables mu bot targeting in complex 3D biomimetic microenvironments.

AB The global automobile market experiences quick changes in design preferences. In response to the demand shifts, manufacturers now try to apply new technologies to bring a novel design to market faster. In this paper, we introduce a novel AI application that performs a similarity verification task of wheel designs that aims to solve the real-world problem. Through the deep metric learning approach, we empirically prove that the cross-entropy loss does similar tasks as the pairwise losses do in the embedding space. On Jan 2022, we successfully transitioned the verification system to the wheel design process of Hyundai Motor Company's design team and shortened the verification time by 90% to a maximum of 10 min. With a few clicks, the designers at Hyundai Motor could take advantage of our verification system.

ID WORKLOAD
AB Detecting the human operator's cognitive state is paramount in settings wherein maintaining optimal workload is necessary for task performance. Blink rate is an established metric of cognitive load, with a higher blink frequency being observed under conditions of greater workload. Measuring blink rate requires the use of eye-trackers which limits the adoption of this metric in the real-world. The authors aim to investigate the effectiveness of using a generic camera-based system as a way to assess the user's cognitive load during a computer task. Participants completed a mental task while sitting in front of a computer. Blink rate was recorded via both the generic camera-based system and a scientific-grade eye-tracker for validation purposes. Cognitive load was also assessed through the performance in a single stimulus detection task. The blink rate recorded via the generic camera-based approach did not differ from the one obtained through the eye-tracker. No meaningful changes in blink rate were however observed with increasing cognitive load. Results show the generic-camera based system may represent a more affordable, ubiquitous means for assessing cognitive workload during computer task. Future work should further investigate ways to increase its accuracy during the completion of more realistic tasks.

AB Current skeleton-based action recognition methods usually assume the input skeleton is complete and noise-free. However, it is inevitable that the captured skeletons are incomplete due to occlusions or noisy due to changes in the environment. When dealing with these data, even State Of The Art (SOTA) recognition backbones experience significant degradation in recognition accuracy. Though a few methods have been proposed to address this issue, they still lack flexibility, efficiency and interpretability. In this work, an overcomplete Graph Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (GCDAE) is proposed which can act as a flexible preprocessing module for pretrained recognition backbones and improve their robustness. Taking advantages of the overcomplete and fully graph convolutional structure, GCDAE is able to rectify noisy joints while keeping information of unspoiled details efficiently. On two large scale skeleton datasets NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, the introducing of GCDAE brings significant robustness improvements to SOTA backbones towards different types of noises.
   To deal with incomplete and noisy skeletons in real-world action recognition, an overcomplete Graph Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (GCDAE) is proposed. The overcomplete and fully graph convolutional structure allows it to rectify noisy joints while preserving unspoiled details, making it possible to combine with any pretrained recognition backbones and improve their robustness in an efficient way.image

AB Decoding speech from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare and neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in this regard: deep-learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings can now start to decode elementary linguistic features such as letters, words and audio-spectrograms. However, extending this approach to natural speech and non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a model trained with contrastive learning to decode self-supervised representations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large cohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and integrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with magneto-encephalography or electro-encephalography while they listened to short stories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify, from 3 seconds of magneto-encephalography signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41% accuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across participants, and with up to 80% in the best participants-a performance that allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The comparison of our model with a variety of baselines highlights the importance of a contrastive objective, pretrained representations of speech and a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across multiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder's predictions suggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic representations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from non-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from brain activity, without putting patients at risk of brain surgery.

TI Matching algorithms for blood donation
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; SIMULATION; MODEL
AB Global demand for donated blood far exceeds supply, and unmet need is greatest in low- and middle-income countries. Large-scale coordination is necessary to alleviate demand. Using the Facebook Blood Donations tool, we conduct a large-scale algorithmic matching of blood donors with donation opportunities. While measuring actual donation rates remains a challenge, we measure donor action (for example, making a donation appointment) as a proxy for actual donation. We develop automated policies for matching patients and donors, based on an online matching model. We provide theoretical guarantees for these policies, both regarding the number of expected donations and the equitable treatment of blood recipients. In simulations, a simple matching strategy increases the number of donations by 5-10%; a pilot experiment with real donors shows a 5% relative increase in donor action rate (from 3.7% to 3.9%). When scaled to the global Blood Donations tool user base, this corresponds to an increase of around 100,000 users taking action toward donation. Further, observing donor action on a social network can shed light on donor behaviour and response to incentives. Our initial findings align with several observations made in the medical and social science literature regarding donor behaviour.
   Online matching platforms are increasingly used for applications with positive social impact such as matching blood donors with recipients, where matching algorithms need to balance fairness with an efficiency objective. The authors demonstrate, both in computational simulations and using real data from the Facebook Blood Donations tool, that introducing a simple online matching policy can substantially increase the likelihood of donor action.

AB Regaining fine motor skills (FMSs; that is, the ability to make precise and coordinated movements of fingers) is the ultimate goal of hand rehabilitation. Although robotic-assisted technologies have been widely explored to help patients with simple hand activities, existing rehabilitation gloves still lack sensory feedback for closed-loop control or involve bulky external hardware, incapable of providing precise FMSs rehabilitation portably. Here we develop a soft rehabilitation glove that can accomplish diverse FMSs by integrating 15 bending sensors and 10 shape-memory-alloy (SMA) actuators. Three joint angles of each finger can be precisely sensed and thus are fed to the control system to actuate SMAs in a closed-loop manner. A touchable human-machine interface is also integrated to provide facile interaction for multi-modal rehabilitation exercises. Weighing only 0.49 kg, our soft glove has high portability, allowing for repetitive hand rehabilitation as needed. We validate that our glove can assist an individual with hand impairments after a stroke to realize a set of single and complex FMS rehabilitation exercises and to complete some activities of daily living.
   Fine motor skill recovery in hand rehabilitation is a challenge due to limited finger movement sensing and closed-loop control algorithms in existing rehabilitation gloves. Sui et al. develop a soft-packaged rehabilitation glove, integrating sensing, actuation, a human-machine interface, power, electronics and a closed-loop algorithm. The glove aids patients after a stroke to recover fine motor skills of the fingers in a portable manner.

AB Distracted driving is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents and has become a bottleneck for improving driver assistance technologies. It is still a challenge to detect distracted driving behavior in real-life scenarios, which have the features of complex backgrounds, different target scales, and resolutions. In this context, a lightweight YOLOv5-GBC model is proposed for real-time distracted driving detection in this work. Firstly, the lightweight network GhostConv is used to perform lightweight operations on the convolutional layers, aiming to reduce a large number of parameters and computations. Secondly, the path aggregation network structure is improved to enhance the model fusion ability for different scale features, and coordinated attention is introduced to enhance the model extraction ability for effective information. The proposed YOLOv5-GBC model can predict different types of distracted driving. Finally, this work conducts extensive experiments; the results show that the proposed model has a mean accuracy (mAP) of 91.8%, which is 3.9% better than the baseline model, with a reduction of 6.5% and 9.1% in the weight file and Floating-point Operations Per Second, respectively. It outperforms the models of Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3-tiny, and YOLOv4-tiny, which indicates that the proposed model can identify distracted driving behaviors efficiently and rapidly.

DT Article; Early Access
DE GOAL agent programming language; Model checking; Decision-making;
   Multi-agent systems
AB Agent Programming Languages have been studied for over 20 years for programming complex decision-making for autonomous systems. The GOAL agent programming language is particularly interesting since it depends on automated planning based on beliefs and goals to determine behavior rather than preprogrammed planning by developers. Model checking is a powerful verification technique to guarantee the safety of an autonomous system. Despite studies of model checking in other agent programming languages, GOAL lacks support for model checking of GOAL programs. The fundamental challenge is to make GOAL programs feasible for model checking. In this paper, we tackle this fundamental issue. First, we formalize the syntax and semantics of the logic underpinning stratified single-agent GOAL programs. Second, we devise an algorithm for transforming a stratified single-agent GOAL program to a transition system that is equivalent in terms of operational semantics, enabling model checking. Third, we develop an automated translator for a stratified single-agent GOAL program. The translator consists of (1) the automated transformation of a GOAL program into its operational semantically equivalent transition system, and (2) the interface generation of the generated transition system into a Prism model, an input for two probabilistic symbolic model checkers: Storm and Prism. Moreover, we point out that we will extend the applicability of the transformation algorithm and its implementation to all stratified GOAL programs.

   segmentation; semi-supervised learning
AB Accurately segmenting medical images is a critical step in clinical diagnosis and developing patient-specific treatment plans. While supervised learning algorithms have achieved excellent performance in this area, they require a large amount of annotated data, which is often time-consuming and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has gained attention as it has the potential to alleviate this challenge by using not only limited labelled data but also a large amount of unlabelled data. A common approach in SSL is to filter out high-entropy features and use the low-entropy part to compute unsupervised loss. However, it is believed that the high-entropy part is also beneficial for model training, and discarding it can lead to information loss. To address this issue, a simple yet efficient contrastive learning approach is proposed in this work for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, called Entropy-Guided Contrastive Learning Segmentation Network (EGCL-Net). The proposed method separates the low-entropy and high-entropy features via the average of predictions, using contrastive loss to pull the intra-class entropy representation distance close and push the inter-class entropy representation distance away. Extensive experiments on the automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset, COVID-19, and BraTS2019 datasets showed that: (1) EGCL-Net can significantly improve performance by utilizing high-entropy representation, and (2) the authors' EGCL-Net outperforms recent state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
   The authors proposed a simple yet efficient contrastive learning approach to make sufficient use of unlabelled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The contrastive loss is employed to pull the intra-class entropy representation distance close and push the inter-class entropy representation distance away. Extensive experiments on the automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset, COVID-19, and BraTS2019 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.image

DT Article; Early Access
DE convolutional neural nets; image processing
AB Deep neural networks significantly enhance the accuracy of the stereo-based disparity estimation. Some current methods suffer from inefficient use of the global context information, which will lead to the loss of structural details in ill-posed areas. To this end, a novel stereo network GAMNet is designed, composed of three core components (GDA, MPF, DCA) for estimating the depth prediction in challenging real-world environments. First, a lightweight attention module is presented, integrating the global semantic cues for every feature position across the channel and spatial dimensions. Next, the MPF module is constructed to fuse the diverse semantic and contextual information from different levels of the feature pyramid. Finally, cost volume is aggregated with a stacked encoder-decoder composed of the DCA module and 3D convolutions, filtering the transmission of matching clues and capturing the rich global contexts. Substantial experiments conducted on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, SceneFlow, and Middlebury-v3 datasets manifest that GAMNet surpasses preceding methods with contour-preserving disparity predictions. In addition, the first 3D scene reconstruction linear evaluation strategy on spatial grasping points for the end-to-end stereo networks in an unsupervised mode is proposed, and it is deployed on the designed robot vision-guided system. In application experiments, the method can produce densely high-precision 3D reconstructions to implement the grasping task in complex real-world scenes, and achieve excellent robust performance with competitive inference efficiency.
   In order to effectively integrate consistent information between the multiple layers of the Swin Transformer, the model conducts parameter self-ensemble of the internal blocks of the Swin Transformer.image

AB As one promising solution, zero-watermarking approaches have been proposed to enhance the image visual quality and applied to protect the intellectual property rights of the medical images, remote sensing images and military images. The moments and their invariants have good image descriptive capability and geometrical invariance, which are common tools for image zero-watermarking. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, most of the existing algorithms ignore the problem of balancing robustness and discriminability. Secondly, the direct computation of image moments is time-consuming, numerically inaccurate, and unstable, thus affecting the effectiveness of these moment-based methods. Third, there is less research on zero-watermarking algorithms targeted at color images. To address these problems, this paper presents a zero-watermarking algorithm which is based on accurate quaternion fractional-order pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments with time-frequency analysis capability for color images. Firstly, we define a new set of orthogonal moments, named fractional-order pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments (FPJFMs), which is characterized by the generic nature and time-frequency analysis capability. And, we propose a scheme for the accurate computation of FPJFMs. Also, we extend accurate FPJFMs to the accurate quaternion FPJFMs (QFPJFMs), which is an efficient color image representation. Next, a new framework is proposed, namely hybrid low-order moment feature (HLMF) based on accurate QFPJFMs, which can simultaneously improve the legibility and robustness of the image representation. Finally, the accurate QFPJFMs-based HLMF is adapted to the zero-watermarking algorithm. Numerous experiment results indicate that this paper's presented zero-watermarking approach provides a good balance between robustness and discriminability, which is an effective and superior scheme.

AB We introduce two new knowledge bases that we have developed to categorize mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and standardize the element definitions of MILP models. MILP is a commonly used mathematical programming technique for modeling and solving real-life scheduling, routing, planning, resource allocation, and timetabling optimization problems providing optimized business solutions for industry sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, defense, healthcare, medicine, energy, finance, and transportation among others. Despite the numerous real-life combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) found and solved, and many yet to be discovered and formulated, the number of types of constraints (the building blocks of a MILP) is relatively small. In the search for a uniform categorization of MILP problems and a machinereadable knowledge representation structure for MILP models, we have developed an optimization modeling tree (OMT) and a MILP model ontology. The two knowledge structures can serve as a standardized, uniform representation in understanding MILP problems and developing MILP models for combinatorial business optimization problems. While there are several algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) for developing and solving MILP models, the semantic correctness of such models cannot be guaranteed using the syntactic grammar of such AMLs. The MILP model ontology will act as the main resource for semantic validation of MILP models through ontology instantiations and axiom assertions.

   Superfluity information
AB Multimodal Clustering (MMC) aims to boost clustering performance by utilizing complementary information from multimodal data. However, the heterogeneous gap between various modalities and the interference of superfluous information in multimodal data makes it challenging to comprehend the complex dependencies between them. To address these issues, we present a Bottleneck Network with Light Attention for Multimodal Clustering (LABMC) to understand the dependencies between different modalities and explore complementary information while maximally eliminating superfluous information. Specifically, Light Attention (LA) is proposed as a concise multimodal interaction mechanism that introduces a convolutional high-level semantic layer to understand the common high-level semantics among different modalities and explores related complementary information to obtain a multimodal fusion representation. It can efficiently comprehend the latent dependencies between diverse modalities to bridge the heterogeneous gap. Subsequently, we construct a Superfluity Elimi-nation (SE) function to erase superfluous information from the modalities. We divide the mutual information between the fusion representation and multimodal data into superfluous information and complementary information. Under the premise of preserving complementary information with an approximation, we utilize a variational optimization method to minimize the mutual information to safely remove superfluity. The combination of LA and SE naturally forms a bottleneck, which enables the extraction of complementary information while reducing superfluous information. Finally, we measure the quality of the modalities to dynamically assign the optimal weights to SE function, which significantly enhances the rationality of SE. Extensive experiment results on five real-world datasets show that LABMC outperforms the state-of-the-art MMC methods.

AB Inspired by the biological evolution, this paper proposes an evolutionary synthesis mechanism to automatically evolve DenseNet towards high sparsity and efficiency for medical image classification. Unlike traditional automatic design methods, this mechanism generates a sparser offspring in each generation based on its previous trained ancestor. Concretely, we use a synaptic model to mimic biological evolution in the asexual reproduction. Each generation's knowledge is passed down to its descendant, and an environmental constraint limits the size of the descendant evolutionary DenseNet, moving the evolution process towards high sparsity. Additionally, to address the limitation of ensemble learning that requires multiple base networks to make decisions, we propose an evolution-based ensemble learning mechanism. It utilises the evolutionary synthesis scheme to generate highly sparse descendant networks, which can be used as base networks to perform ensemble learning in inference. This is specially useful in the extreme case when there is only a single network. Finally, we propose the MEEDNets (Medical Image Classification via Ensemble Bio-inspired Evolutionary DenseNets) model which consists of multiple evolutionary DenseNet-121s synthesised in the evolution process. Experimental results show that our bio-inspired evolutionary DenseNets are able to drop less important structures and compensate for the increasingly sparse architecture. In addition, our proposed MEEDNets model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two publicly accessible medical image datasets.

AB Fire recognition has emerged as a critical concern in the field of fire safety. Deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have found widespread application in fire recognition tasks. The capsule network, a higher-level variant of CNN, offers distinct advantages in terms of enhanced recognition accuracy, making it suitable for fire recognition applications. However, the capsule network faces challenges in effectively determining the presence or absence of fire objects due to the idiosyncrasies of its dynamic routing algorithm. To address this issue and enable effective fire recognition, we propose a novel approach that involves a multi-layer capsule network. Within this framework, we introduce a joint dynamic routing algorithm that computes output values during forward propagation within the multi-layer capsule network. Additionally, we present a new loss function and a fully connected auxiliary training layer designed to train the multi-layer capsule networks effectively. Comparative evaluations against conventional CNN architectures and recent state-of-the-art fire recognition methods demonstrate that the enhanced multi-layer capsule network achieves higher test accuracy, even with limited training samples and fewer training iterations. Furthermore, owing to its reduced model parameter scale, the multi-layer capsule network exhibits faster recognition speeds compared to the aforementioned methods.

AB In the context of multicriteria decision analysis, Pairwise Comparison Matrices (PCMs) represent a widely-used mathematical structure to capture comparisons about criteria or alternatives. When a confidence (or uncertainty) level is associated to the provided comparison measures, PCMs are naturally extended to the so-called Interval Pairwise Comparison Matrices (IPCM). Classical approaches, based on the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix (Analytic Hierarchy Process) or optimization problems (e.g. the Logarithmic Least Squares approach), are frequently adopted in order to estimate absolute utilities from relative judgements in absence of expert's uncertainty. Conversely, in the presence of uncertain measures, computationally intensive approaches based on Monte Carlo analysis have been adopted. In this paper, starting from a given PCM, we provide an approach able to find the smallest multiplicative perturbations of its elements able to perturb the obtained ranking from the ordinal perspective. On the basis of such approach, we provide theoretical results which can be adopted also in the case of uncertain measures (e.g., IPCMs) with the aim to characterize the stability of the obtained ranking on the basis of the given uncertainty. As testified by numerical examples that conclude the paper, the proposed framework can greatly simplify the classical approaches by providing the possibility to make direct assumptions on the final outcome of Monte Carlo analysis and reducing or avoiding its required computational effort.

AB Microgrids have become popular candidates for integrating diverse energy sources into the power grid as means of reducing fossil fuel usage. Energy Resource Management (ERM) is a type of Unit Commitment problem, where a player operates a microgrid with diverse renewable generators integrated with an external supplier. Calculating the economic dispatch of each committed unit on a planning horizon is an NP-hard problem, and therefore, finding an exact solution is difficult. This paper presents a multi-objective solution to the ERM problem from the perspective of battery operation and external supplier dispatch. First, a novel multi-objective decision problem modeling is proposed that considers three objectives: cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and battery degradation. This framework involves a learning agent that controls the depth of discharge of a Lithium-Ion battery. To address the proposed problem, a new multi-objective algorithm called Multi-Objective Evolutionary Policy Search (MEPS) is introduced. The proposed algorithm uses NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies structure to evolve artificial neural networks for estimating action-preference values considering multi-objective rewards. The MEPS performance is evaluated on both standard and newly-proposed benchmark problems, using the hypervolume as the evaluation metric. When compared to standard deep reinforcement learning, results showed that MEPS provides cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient energy storage management solutions. Furthermore, MEPS effectively solves the proposed ERM problem by finding neural networks with a small number of nodes and connections, which are suitable for use in embedded control systems. Overall, MEPS proved to be a promising multi-objective approach in the transition to clean energy resources.

ID MULTIPLE-OBJECT TRACKING
AB Multi-object Tracking (MOT) is very important in human surveillance, sports analytics, autonomous driving, and cooperative robots. Current MOT methods do not perform well in non-uniform movements, occlusion and appearance-reappearance scenarios. We introduce a comprehensive MOT method that seamlessly merges object detection and identity linkage within an end-to-end trainable framework, designed with the capability to maintain object links over a long period of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is architectured around 4 key modules: (1) Candidate proposal creation network, generates object proposals via vision-Transformer encoder-decoder architecture; (2) Scale variant pyramid, progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; (3) Spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and (4) Spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical object state observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT resides in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with an attention mechanism and eradicates the need for post-processing. Experimental results show that STMMOT archives scores of 79.8 and 78.4 for IDF1, 79.3 and 74.1 for MOTA, 73.2 and 69.0 for HOTA, 61.2 and 61.5 for AssA, and maintained an ID switch count of 1529 and 1264 on MOT17 and MOT20, respectively. When evaluated on MOT20, it scored 78.4 in IDF1, 74.1 in MOTA, 69.0 in HOTA, and 61.5 in AssA, and kept the ID switch count to 1264. Compared with the previous best TransMOT, STMMOT achieves around a 4.58% and 4.25% increase in IDF1, and ID switching reduction to 5.79% and 21.05% on MOT17 and MOT20, respectively.

AB We explore the reinforcement learning approach to designing controllers by extensively discussing the case of a quadcopter attitude controller. We provide all details allowing to reproduce our approach, starting with a model of the dynamics of a crazyflie 2.0 under various nominal and non-nominal conditions, including partial motor failures and wind gusts. We develop a robust form of a signal temporal logic to quantitatively evaluate the vehicle's behavior and measure the performance of controllers. The paper thoroughly describes the choices in training algorithms, neural net architecture, hyperparameters, observation space in view of the different performance metrics we have introduced. We discuss the robustness of the obtained controllers, both to partial loss of power for one rotor and to wind gusts and finish by drawing conclusions on practical controller design by reinforcement learning.

AB This research aims to address the staff-based vehicle relocation problem that arises in a one-way car-sharing system operating in a combined mode, in which both on-street parking slots and parking hubs are utilized. The objective of the problem is to determine the relocation plan for vehicles and travel routes for staff with the minimum operational costs. A novel mathematical model is proposed to control the model size, in which the parking spaces constraint is considered without introducing dummy nodes. Then, based on the structure of the model, a heuristic algorithm with tailored operators and the initial solution generation method is proposed to solve the problem. The experimental results demonstrate that, with the tailored operators and solving strategies, the proposed method outperforms commercial solvers and other existing heuristic algorithms in terms of both solving efficiency and solution quality. Furthermore, a group of test cases generated from real cases is utilized to examine the performance of the relocation plan in different scenarios. The results indicate that the overall operation costs of the car-sharing system could be effectively controlled by distributing parking capacities among parking hubs evenly. In addition, the proposed model and high-efficiency algorithm also enable decision-makers to test the performance of the car-sharing system in various scenarios and help them to get a better understanding of the system.

DT Article
DE Feature extraction; Image classification; Domain adaptation;

ID ALIGNMENT
AB Domain adaptation (DA) has become a widely used technique for cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Most DA methods aim to learn a domain invariant subspace that reduce the domain discrepancy between source and target domains. However, some of them fail to explore the local manifold structure between different domains, while also neglecting the negative influences of abnormal features. To solve these problems, we propose a Locality Robust Domain Adaptation (LRDA) method for cross-domain data recognition. In LRDA, the statistical alignment is applied to reduce the domain-shift between the source and target domains. Then, LRDA combines the row-sparsity constraint and the discriminant regularization term to learn a robust projection matrix, while maintaining the discriminative capability of the matrix. Furthermore, a manifold regularization term is proposed to automatically learn the nearest neighbors and weights between two domains. The proposed LRDA not only reduces the discrepancy between two domains but also explores the local neighbor information between them. Experiment results on three HSI datasets illustrate that the proposed LRDA has better performance than other related methods.

TI Code-aware fault localization with pre-training and interpretable

DE Fault localization; Pre-training; Interpretable machine learning
AB Following the rapid development of deep learning, many studies in the field of fault localization (FL) have utilized deep learning to analyze statements' coverage information (i.e., executed or not executed) and test cases' results (i.e., failing or passing), which have shown dramatic ability in identifying suspicious statements potentially responsible for failures. However, they mainly pay attention to the binary information of executing test cases but ignore incorporating code snippets and their inner relationships into the learning process. Furthermore, how a complex deep learning model for FL achieves a particular decision is not transparent. These drawbacks may limit the effectiveness of FL. Recently, graph-based pre-training techniques have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in a variety of code-related tasks such as natural language code search, clone detection, code translation, code refinement, etc. And interpretable machine learning tackles the problem of non-transparency and enables learning models to explain or present their behaviors to humans in an understandable way.In this paper, our insight is to select a candidate solution that leverages the promising learning ability of graph-based pre-training techniques to learn a feasible model for incorporating code snippets as well as their inner relationships into fault localization, and then uses interpretable machine learning to localize faulty statements. Thus, we propose CodeAwareFL, a code-aware fault localization technique with pre-training and interpretable machine learning. Concretely, CodeAwareFL constructs a variety of code snippets through executing test cases. Next, CodeAwareFL utilizes the code snippets to extract propagation chains which could show a set of variables interact with each other to cause a failure. After that, a graph-based pre-trained model is customized for fault localization. CodeAwareFL takes the code snippets and their corresponding propagation chains as inputs with test results as labels to conduct the training process. Finally, CodeAwareFL evaluates the suspiciousness of statements with interpretable machine learning techniques. In the experimental study, we choose 12 large-sized programs to conduct the comparison. The results show that CodeAwareFL achieves promising results (e.g., 32.43% faults are ranked within top 5), and is significantly better than 12 state-of-the-art baselines.

DE defect detection; target detection; GSConv; SimAM; loss function
AB Deep learning-based methods for detecting surface defects on strip steel have advanced detection capabilities, but there are still problems of target loss, false alarms, large computation, and imbalance between detection accuracy and detection speed. In order to achieve a good balance between detection accuracy and speed, a lightweight YOLOv5 strip steel surface defect detection algorithm based on YOLOv5s is proposed. Firstly, we introduce the efficient lightweight convolutional layer called GSConv. The Slim Neck, designed based on GSConv, replaces the original algorithm's neck, reducing the number of network parameters and improving detection speed. Secondly, we incorporate SimAM, a non-parametric attention mechanism, into the improved neck to enhance detection accuracy. Finally, we utilize the SIoU function as the regression prediction loss instead of the original CIoU to address the issue of slow convergence and improve efficiency. According to experimental findings, the YOLOv5-GSS algorithm outperforms the YOLOv5 method by 2.9% on the NEU-DET dataset and achieves an average accuracy (mAP) of 83.8% with a detection speed (FPS) of 100 Hz, which is 3.8 Hz quicker than the YOLOv5 algorithm. The proposed model outperforms existing approaches and is more useful, demonstrating the efficacy of the optimization strategy.

AB Neural networks (NNs) have witnessed widespread deployment across various domains, including some safety-critical applications. In this regard, the demand for verifying means of such artificial intelligence techniques is more and more pressing. Nowadays, the development of evaluation approaches for NNs is a hot topic that is attracting considerable interest, and a number of verification methods have been proposed. Yet, a challenging issue for NN verification is pertaining to the scalability when some NNs of practical interest have to be evaluated. This work aims to present INNAbstract, an abstraction method to reduce the size of NNs, which leads to improving the scalability of NN verification and reachability analysis methods. This is achieved by merging neurons while ensuring that the obtained model (i.e., abstract model) overapproximates the original one. INNAbstract supports networks with numerous activation functions. In addition, we propose a heuristic for nodes' selection to build more precise abstract models, in the sense that the outputs are closer to those of the original network. The experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing relevant abstraction techniques. Furthermore, they demonstrate that INNAbstract can help the existing verification tools to be applied on larger networks while considering various activation functions.

DE Abstract argumentation; Orderings; Induced equivalences
ID STRONG EQUIVALENCE
AB The article is devoted to the issue of comparing argumentation frameworks (AFs) which has received increasing attention in recent years. Knowing whether a given framework F possesses less information than an AF G or whether the latter is at least reachable from F in a certain future scenario is an important issue for several applications. The question what we precisely mean by information will depend on the particular context in which they are being used. Our analysis does not express any preferences here. However, if AFs are applied to fields like criminal justice, finance, and healthcare, where it is necessary to exercise caution, skeptical accepted arguments may be the most appropriate form of reasoning. The presented overview considers classical Dung semantics including the stable, admissible, complete, grounded and preferred one. The article is divided into two main axes: the distinction between extension-based and kernel-based orderings and the analysis of their static and dynamic versions. The results show that there are various relationships between these concepts, indicating that some orderings are stronger or weaker than others. The considered orderings are so-called preorders, i.e. they satisfy reflexivity and transitivity. We analyzed them w.r.t. bounds, meets and joins and also considered the induced equivalences. The latter often coincide with well-known equivalences, namely ordinary and strong equivalence.

AB Data augmentation is a commonly-used technique to avoid over-fitting in deep learning. However, the mechanism behind effective data augmentation methods is unclear. To address this issue, we explore and identify two critical factors: semantic preservation and diversity to assess the quality of data augmentation in natural language processing. Our study focus on text sentiment classification and examines these two factors on two commonly-used data augmentation methods: synonym replacement and random deletion. Based on the discovery, we propose two new augmentation methods: TF-IDF word dropout and adaptive synonym replacement. Experimental results demonstrate that these two new data augmentation methods are effective. Moreover, with further experiments, we summarize three strategies for improving data augmentation methods in sentiment classification task. These strategies are employing online augmentation, introducing word importance into word sampling process, and filtering augmented data based on the current model state. We hope that our study will inspire some new perspectives on the underlying principles of data augmentation's effectiveness and contribute to a systematic study of data augmentation methods in future.

AB In solving expensive optimization problems, most research focuses on using either a single global surrogate or multiple local surrogates in surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) or evolutionary Bayesian optimization (EBO). It is challenging for single global or multiple local surrogates to balance the exploration and exploitation of algorithms. To address this issue, the paper proposes a framework of global exploration and local exploitation with surrogates for solving expensive optimization problems. In detail, a scalable Gaussian process (GP) is used to fit the global fitness landscape and guide algorithms towards global exploration. A radial basis function network (RBFN) guides algorithms for local exploitation by capturing the local patterns identified by the global surrogate. In the local exploitation, a local search region is proposed to ensure that the search region contains the bilateral region of the current optimum solution. This way, the exploration and exploitation of algorithms can be balanced cooperatively by global and local surrogates. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been investigated and analyzed on a set of expensive benchmark problems.

AB A new algorithm, namely Z-numbers-based deep feature thresholding (Z-DFT) is described for handling the issue concerning uncertainty that arises while classifying various fall and no-fall events in complex scenarios in both indoor (viz., home and hospital) and outdoor (viz., construction area and road). The Z-DFT consists of four phases: (i) object detection and tracking, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature thresholding and rule generation, and (iv) Z-numbers-based analysis for quantifying the reliability of the detected falls. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, Z-DFT uses both OpenPose and object-level features. This enables better modeling of both indoor and outdoor falls. New object-level features considered are change in area, aspect ratio, speed variation, and change in direction of the detected objects. The detection of fall locations involves two phases, viz., probable location and specific location. The probable location corresponding to each OpenPose and object-level feature is determined based on its statistical information. The commonality of these probable locations results in the specific location which is determined by framing linguistic rules using all the features. Z-numbers computed with features further reflect the reliability of detection. The characteristic features of Z-DFT are demonstrated over eighteen real-time videos acquired from YouTube8M and UR Fall data, along with its superiority claimed over ten state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT; ILLUMINATION; RETINEX
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient and fast low-light image enhancement method using an atmospheric scattering model based on an inverted low-light image. The transmission map is derived as a function of two saturations of the original image in the two color spaces. Due to the difficulty in estimating the saturation of the original image, the transmission map is converted into a function of the average and maximum values of the original image. These two values are estimated from a given low-light image using the gamma correction prior. In addition, a pixel-adaptive gamma value determination algorithm is proposed to prevent under-or over-enhancement. The proposed algorithm is fast because it does not require the training or refinement process. The simulation results show that the proposed low-light enhancement scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches regarding both computational simplicity and enhancement efficiency. The code is available on https://github.com/TripleJ2543.

AB Noise cancellation plays a crucial role in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of fault characteristics, making it an essential step in fault diagnosis, particularly during the early stages of a fault. Among various adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) methods, evolutionary digital filter (EDF) stands out as an effective approach. EDF employs an adaptive algorithm based on biological evolutionary computation to control its operations. The quality of noise cancellation performance directly relies on the global optimization ability of EDF. However, conventional EDF and its improved versions mainly rely on random search strategies involving cloning and mating, which lack an explicit search direction akin to gradient-based methods. Consequently, substantial computational resources are wasted. To address this problem, an improved algorithm called particle swarm optimization-based evolutionary digital filter (PSO-EDF) is newly proposed. The central concept of this method is to integrate the PSO algorithm into the global optimization process of EDF. By introducing PSO, explicit search directions are provided to individuals adopting the cloning strategy, thus promoting cooperation and information sharing among individuals. The PSO-aided EDF significantly enhances the global optimization capability of ANC filter parameters. Through the proposed PSO-EDF method, the ability to achieve global optimization of ANC filter parameters is substantially improved. This approach mitigates the resource wastage associated with traditional EDF techniques, offering a more efficient and effective solution for noise cancellation in fault diagnosis.

AB Ordinal classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging problem that occurs in many real-world appli-cations. The main challenge is to simultaneously consider the classes ordering and imbalanced distribution. Although the classic synthetic instances oversampling techniques can improve the identification of minority classes, they easily incur the damage of the classes ordering when the synthetic instances fall in non-adjacent classes regions. In this paper, we propose a powerful method for handling the imbalanced problem embedded in the ordinal classification, namely Iterative Minority oversampling technique for imbalanced Ordinal Classification (IMOC). Concretely, we first develop an iterative identification procedure to select the minority instance that is hardest to learn. Then, a weighted oversampling probability distribution that respects the ordinal nature is used to generate synthetic minority instances to balance the skewed distribution. Furthermore, two novel ensemble versions are developed to boost the capability of our proposed IMOC. In order to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods, an extensive experimental study is carried out on a large number of datasets from real-world applications. The experimental results supported by proper statistical tests indicate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the most frequently used performance measures.

TI Decomposing texture and semantic for out-of-distribution detection
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Out-of-distribution detection; Robustness; Feature representation
AB The out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task assumes samples that follow the distribution of training data as in-distribution (ID), while samples from other data distributions are considered OOD. In recent years, the OOD detection tasks have made significant progress since many studies observed that the distribution mismatch between training and real datasets can severely deteriorate the reliability of AI systems. Nevertheless, the lack of precise interpretation for the in-distribution (ID) limits the application of the OOD detection methods to real-world systems. To tackle this, we decompose the definition of the ID into texture and semantics, motivated by the demands of real-world scenarios. We also design new benchmarks to measure the robustness that OOD detection methods should have. Our proposed benchmark verifies not only the precision but also the robustness of the detection models. It is crucial to measure both factors in OOD detection as they indicate different traits of the model. For instance, precision is relevant to scenarios that detect minor cracks in the conveyor belt of a smart factory, whereas robustness pertains to maintaining performance under diverse weather conditions, as required by autonomous driving. To achieve a good balance between the OOD detection performance and robustness, our method takes a divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, the proposed model first handles each component of the texture and semantics separately and then fuses these later. This philosophy is empirically proven by a series of benchmarks including both the proposed and the conventional counterpart. By decomposing the prior "unclear" definition of the ID into texture and semantic components, our novel approach better suits the demands of a reliable machine learning system, which requires robustness and consistent performance across varied scenarios. Unlike prior works, our approach does not rely on any extra datasets or labels. This prevents our proposed framework from being dependent on a particular dataset distribution.

DE Bayesian network; Local causal structure learning; Missing data
ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB Local causal structure learning aims to discover and distinguish the direct causes and direct effects of a target variable. However, the state-of-the-art algorithms for local causal structure learning fail to perform well when dealing with missing data. The general approach is to fill in the missing data using imputation techniques before learning the local causal structure, but this method suffers from problems such as low accuracy, low efficiency, and instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for local causal structure learning with missing data, named misLCS. Firstly, we design an iterative data imputation method to obtain the complete and correct data from the missing data. Then, misLCS adopts a data subset strategy to get a data subset that variables are closely related to the target variable. Thirdly, within this data subset, misLCS constructs the local causal skeleton of the target variable using a mutual information-based feature selection method and orients the direction of edges using conditional independence tests and Meek rules. Finally, misLCS updates the missing data in preparation for the next iteration. This procedure continues until the direct causes and direct effects of the target variable have been identified. Our experiments on seven benchmark Bayesian networks and a real-world bioinformatics dataset, with a number of variables from 11 to 801, demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better accuracy than the existing local causal structure learning algorithms.

AB In this paper, a lightweight printed circuit board (PCB) defects detection model (light-PDD) is proposed, which mainly concentrates on overcoming the deficiencies of redundant parameters and slow inference speed in most existing methods. In particular, overall framework of the proposed light-PDD has followed the YOLOv4 model with further enhancement, and the backbone part adopts a pruned MobileNetV3 structure for feature extraction, where a dual-domain attention mechanism is designed and diverse activation functions are employed so that the model can effectively handle the difficulties in detecting tiny-size PCB defects. Moreover, the improved cross-stage partial structure is deployed for feature fusion, which removes redundant parameters and avoids duplication of gradient information so as to reduce the model complexity. Extensive experiments on public PCB defect datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed light-PDD, which outperforms several other advanced algorithms in terms of realizing the balance between inference speed and detection accuracy. In addition, the size of the proposed light-PDD is only 95.7 MB, the inference speed is improved by 34.37 frames per second of light-PDD as compared to the baseline model YOLOv4 and simultaneously, a comparable accuracy of 97.13% is obtained, which verifies that the proposed light-PDD is a reliable and competitive lightweight model for PCB defects detection.

AB Estimating the relative depth of a single image (Monocular Depth Estimation) is a significant step towards understanding the general structure of the depicted scenery, the relations of entities in the scene and their interactions. When faced with the task of estimating the depth of a scene without the use of Stereo images, we are dependent on the availability of large-scale depth datasets and high-capacity models to capture the intrinsic nature of depth. Unfortunately, creating large-scale datasets of depth images is not a trivial task. To overcome this limitation, In this work, a new approach is proposed to accumulate Depth & Surface Normal datasets from the world of different Video Games in an easy and reproducible way. This work also introduces a new loss function to better incorporate the relation between the Depth and the Surface Normal of a scene which results in higher quality depth estimations that also produce more uniform surface normals. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons are provided between the proposed method and the best approaches of the last nine years and have competitive performance to the State of the Art by having approximate to 24 times less parameters for the proposed method. To further prove the effectiveness of this approach, an Ablation Study is also provided. Experiments on this dataset shows that using this new loss function alongside synthetic datasets increases the accuracy of "Monocular Depth Estimation in the Wild" tasks where other approaches usually fail to generalize.

AB Fog computing (FC) extends cloud technology by providing services, storage, and network interaction between data centers and end devices. By putting storage and processing closer to the network edge, fog computing may improve IDS effectiveness and efficiency. We develop a cloud-fog intrusion detection system (CFIDS) that employs cloud and fog resources to identify threats in the current research. However, the attack affects data packets from Fog layer nodes. The majority of intrusive cyber-attacks are close variants of previously identified cyber attacks with duplicate data and attributes. In addition, the data packet must be analyzed to determine the intrusion. SYN packets, used to initiate TCP connections, flood a victim's network in a syn threat. To mitigate the impact of syn attacks in a FC environment, it is essential to implement the necessary security measures. Deep learning-based IDS are suitable for protecting fog computing layers from attacks and addressing current issues. The authors of this paper have put forth a new hybrid architecture for DL intrusion detection in fog computing, which combines the use of DL models. Due to the large dimensionality of network data, Radial basis functionbased support vector regression (RBFSVR) is initially used to minimize the dimensionality of the data and reduce the training time. Then, on the cloud server, the integrated VGG19 and 2DCNN are utilized to complete the dataset's training and transfer it to the fog layer, where data transmission is observed and threats are recognized. Experiments with the UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, and CICIDS2018 datasets demonstrate that the techniques presented in this paper outperforms other comparable techniques in terms of detection rate, F-score, precision, recall, FAR, and accuracy, thereby solving the problem of intrusion detection. In addition, by analyzing irregular patterns of network traffic, flow duration is utilized to avoid harmful attacks in a fog computing environment.

AB Due to the significance of environmental and economic topics and limited resources, integrating Circular Economy (CE) principles is necessary for Supply Chain (SC) to improve sustainable competitive advantage. The integration of CE in SCs leads to a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design (CLSCND) and a circular SC to achieve the economic, environmental, and social aspects of outputs and processes. On the other hand, the integration of CE in CLSCND faces hybrid uncertainties in different time horizons and scenarios due to the strategic and long-term nature of decisions. Due to the impact of random and cognitive uncertainties in the long term, it is necessary to consider these factors in the integration of CE in CLSCND. So, the aim of the present study is CLSCND to achieve the principles of CE and provide a robust scenario-based possibilistic-stochastic programming approach to consider cognitive and random uncertainties simultaneously. The contributions and innovations of the present study are the integration of CE in CLSCND, considering cognitive and random uncertainties at the same time, developing the Me criterion to achieve flexible solutions based on the convex combination of opinions of experts, and proposing the use of the absolute possible deviation to consider the possibilistic deviation. A case study was investigated for CLSCND in the paper industry to assess the presented approach, and the results indicated the accuracy and robustness of the solutions. The numerical simulation results demonstrated the appropriate performance of the proposed method, that the lowest average and standard deviation values of the constraints violation were 601 and 48, respectively, in the developed approach. Analytical findings show that implementing CE in the paper CLSCND provides insights for managers in demand and capacity constraint violations based on different risk levels. Also, this study offers a comprehensive framework for presenting robustness and flexible solutions in CLSC problems based on changes in robustness coefficients and sensitivity analysis of parameters of the CLSCND, which can create a trade-off between CE objectives in uncertain parameters.

AB Multiplicative preference relations can be expanded into Neutrosophic multiplicative preference relations (NMPR) and Interval Neutrosophic Multiplicative Preference Relations (INMPR). They are appropriate for capturing the experts' assessments' uncertainty, ambiguity, and indeterminacy. This work aims to provide a consistency and consensus-based approach for dealing with group decision-making using NMPRs and INMPRs, as well as many goal programming models to manage the consistency and consensus of NMPRs and INMPRs. To define and measure acceptable consistency for NMPRs and INMPRs, the study first offers a consistency index. Several consistency-based programming approaches are designed to address the inconsistency and provide an appropriate consistent NMPR and INMPR for an NMPR and INMPR that are not consistent enough. We provide a consistency-based approach to NMPR and INMPR decision-making. Then, considering the consensus in GDM, a consensus index is suggested for determining the level of agreement between specific NMPRs and INMPRs. Thereafter, a group NMPR and INMPR are created by combining individual NMPRs and INMPRs using an aggregation operator that ensures the consistency of the group NMPRs and INMPRs. With a collection of NMPRs and INMPRs, a consistency- and consensus-based GDM approach is built on single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS) and interval-valued neutrosophic sets (IVNS). Finally, two real-world numerical examples are shown, along with a comparison. The proposed method checked the individual consistency level and the group consensus, which is less than the existing method. The ranking of the alternatives was given, which was more convincing than the existing methods. It is also clear that it is much simpler than the previous methods.

AB To address the limitations associated with the low intelligence of welding robots, a weld seam type identification and initial point guidance method based on deep neural network named WeldNet was proposed. By incorporating channel shuffling and an attention module, the size of the WeldNet model is reduced while preserving high detection accuracy. With the help of the proposed Center-Box annotation method, the optimized WeldNet network can not only automatically identify the type of welding workpieces at a frequency of 66 Hz, but also extract the initial point of the weld seam with an error of less than 1.63 pixels. Based on the principle of "monocular vision dual position shooting", automatic guidance of the initial point of the weld seam is achieved, which greatly improves the intelligence level of welding robots. The experimental results show that the method proposed can accurately identify various types of weld joints such as butt joints, lap joints, and fillet joints with a recognition rate of 99.6%, and the method can also guide the welding torch to align with the initial point of the weld seam with an error of just 0.85 mm.

AB Leather footwear export plays a crucial role in the Indian economy as India is the second largest footwear producer in the world. As a commodity, it is unavoidable to emphasize its export performance by forecasting. This paper aims to bring out an Artificial Neural Network based model to predict India's leather footwear export. Towards forecasting Leather footwear export, the dataset comprising five commodities covered under leather footwear has been taken from 1996 to 97 to 2021-22. The authors have proposed India's Leather Footwear Export -Artificial Neural Network (ILFE-ANN) model with SGD optimizer and activation functions such as Sigmoid / Logistic and Rectified linear unit (ReLU). The authors have kept null values as it is in the data than replacing them with imputation methods such as mean and median while modelling. Outliers are replaced with the mean value of the remaining data before modelling. Moreover, different learning algorithms such as Adaptive Moment (Adam), RMS Propagation (RMSProp), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and SGD with Momentum (SGDM) have been compared to choose an optimal one before being implemented in the ILFE-ANN. The vali-dation of the ILFE-ANN model has been implemented for the prediction of livestock population and compared with the Regression model. The variation percentage confirms that the proposed ILFE-ANN model performs significantly with 0.51% RMSProp, 1.68 % SGDM and 2.54 % SGD. Further, the minimum value of performance metrics MAE, MAPE and RMSE obtained are 0.4, 0.5 and 0.5 respectively for the prediction of sheep population for the year 2017. It shows that SGD performs better with the least error rate of 8% MAPE for the export of leather Commodity 64035113. Hence, the study confirms that the ANN model with SGD optimizer performs better for the prediction of India's leather footwear trade data.

AB Blind super-resolution endeavors to restore clear and high-resolution images from obscure degraded images. To comprehensively encompass the diverse range of real image degradations, prevailing research methods either explicitly or implicitly simulate image degradation. Nevertheless, a majority of prior approaches employ conventional interpolation algorithms for resize operations, thereby impeding the breadth of image degradation diversity. In the case of implicit models, we propose a dynamic learnable degradation (DLD) model, achieved through self-supervised training. This model leverages a dynamic downsampling module to generate a multitude of low-resolution images. By introducing DLD as a novel downsampling method, we devise an original explicit degradation model, which generates additional sets of training image pairs to enhance the practical restoration outcomes of ESRGAN for natural images, called Dynamic-ESRGAN. We also account for the overall degradation and put forth a hybrid-order degradation model to encompass the manifold degradations prevalent in natural images. Exhaustive experimental comparisons conducted on both synthetic and real datasets have unequivocally demonstrated the significant advantages of our DLD and Dynamic-ESRGAN models, both in terms of objective indicators and subjective perception.

AB Hybrid methods combining data decomposition with deep learning have recently exhibited remarkable performance in PM2.5 concentration forecasting. However, these methods still encounter limitations when confronted with monitoring sites lacking adequate historical data. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a novel methodological framework named as Multi-source Variational Mode Transfer Learning (MSVMTL) that integrates data decomposition, deep learning, and multi-source transfer learning strategies. The framework consists of four stages: source domain selection, data decomposition by Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), mode sequence clustering, and multi-source mode transfer learning. The source domain selection stage utilizes EMS (Euclidean Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy Distance) to identify the most suitable source domain for knowledge transfer. The mode sequence clustering employs the LDDK algorithm (Largest Triangle Three Buckets, Dynamic Time Warping, Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging, and K-means) to cluster modes from VMD-derived domains. The multi-source mode transfer stage combines VMD with pre-training and fine-tuning, leveraging source domain knowledge for target domain prediction. To validate the proposed framework, a case study, including multiple sets of comparative experiments and ablation study, was conducted using data from 12 air quality monitoring sites in Beijing, China. The experimental results demonstrate that EMS, LDDK, and multi-source mode transfer learning strategy all achieved excellent performance, and the presented MSVMTL significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 concentrations at monitoring sites with limited historical data.

AB Crowdfunding has emerged as a popular and efficient digital financing method. This paper investigates the product line design and introduction strategy of crowdfunding products in the presence of social learning when consumers are uncertain about their quality preferences and are allowed to return products. The results reveal that the consumer preference level and the preference level gap between high-and low-type consumers impact the optimal introduction strategy. Specifically, under the high-quality products' first sequential introduction strategy, the optimal quality and pricing decision of low-quality products are similar to the results of classical product line design in that the gap between optimal prices for the product line increases with the consumers' high-and low-quality preference levels and the proportion of high-quality preference consumers in the high -segment market. However, when introducing low-quality products first, the quality gap for the product line decreases in low-quality preference levels. Besides, the introduction strategy for menu crowdfunding products mainly depends on consumers' quality preference levels and the gap between high-and low-quality preference levels. Finally, social learning can greatly alleviate consumers' uncertainty about product preferences, reduce return rates, and bring greater profits to creators. It has a significant positive effect on creators than without social learning. The findings of this paper have essential implications for crowdfunding product design and introduction strategy in the presence of social learning and consumer uncertainty.

ID DESIGN
AB Intelligent systems are already being deployed in several fields (e.g., medicine, education, automation, or legal), providing relevant tools to assist in our daily tasks. It is claimed that the next step of AI is the integration of connectionist and symbolic methods. Connectionist methods embody knowledge by assigning numerical conductivities or weights to the connections inside a network of nodes. Symbolic methods work by carrying on a sequence of logic-like reasoning steps over a set of symbols consisting of language-like representations. Combining the strengths of connectionist and symbolic methods can allow the development of robust intelligent systems. We propose a neural-symbolic BDI-agent based Multi-Context Systems (MCS) model to integrate these two methods. Neural-symbolic area explores the effective integration of connectionist and symbolic methods, more precisely, learning and reasoning. MCSs allow the representation of information exchange among heterogeneous sources. BDI-agents offer robust and flexible behavior, rapid and modular development, intelligibility, and verifiability. In our work, MCSs represent the symbolic method and Neural Networks the connectionist method. We present a case study of how the proposed agent can be implemented using the Sigon framework. Sigon facilitates the development of MCS agents using a programming language-like paradigm. In this case study, we employed a trained MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, enabling us to mitigate the necessity of modeling some hand-crafted rules in symbolic systems. We performed two experiments, in which the main goal was to analyze the impact of using a neural network during the agent's decision-making. In the first experiment, we compare the proposed agent with 136 negotiating agents participating in the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) available on the GENIUS framework. In the second experiment, we compare our work with one similar to ours. The results show that our agent can adapt and achieve high utility functions for different situations. However, it is necessary to consider the computational cost of using the NN's output in every reasoning cycle. The contributions of this paper are: (i) -integration of connectionist methods as part of the agent's decision-making, enabling the development of agents in a modular and flexible fashion; (ii) -custom sensors to handle different data types; (iii) -practical implementation of the proposed integration method; and (iv) -experiments of the proposed integration method, focusing on mitigating the necessity of hard-coded and hand-crafted rules.

AB Neural machine translation has predominantly outperformed previous machine translation models primarily for resourceful languages. However, very little work has been reported for resource-constrained languages such as Khasi. The Khasi language belongs to the Mon-Khmer branch of the Austroasiatic language family and is spoken primarily in the state of Meghalaya in India. Although performing neural machine translation for the under-resourced Khasi language is difficult, we build a substantial parallel corpus of English-Khasi. We apply three segmentation methods in the datasets for our experiments: untokenized, tokenized and a subword BPE (Byte Pair Encoding). Experiments are carried out on this dataset with different aspects of neural machine translation systems using cutting-edge architectures such as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and a transformer based model for the English-Khasi language pair. We also carry out experiments by adapting the transfer learning approach using English-Vietnamese as the parent language pair and English-Khasi as the child language pair. This work reports a quantitative and qualitative analysis of several models based on architectural and data segmentation methodologies. The experimental findings show that the model adapted using the transfer learning approach achieved a reasonable improvement in BLEU scores with the highest being 58.1 BLEU on similar domains and 17.7 BLEU for the general domain outscoring the other models for the same language pair. Qualitative analysis is carried out focusing on the morphological inflections of gender identification in the translated output.

DE Adaptive trust model; reinforcement learning; multiagent teaming
AB The performance of agents is highly influenced by multiple factors, including ability, decision, and states. Trust modeling is widely used to boost the performance of multiagent teaming (MAT). However, most existing trust models rely on statistical methods or preset parameters to assess the trust value in the MAT scenario. In this article, an adaptive trust model is proposed to evaluate comprehensive trust values based on multiple pieces of evidence from variant sources. The proposed trust model leverages information fusion and RL to properly fuse multiple pieces of evidence to generate trust value for every agent in MAT. The trust value is then used in an interaction protocol with MAT to increase the efficiency of cooperation. To verify the performance of the proposed trust model, a ball-collection experiment is designed for MAT to work cooperatively in simulation environments. Two different scenario settings are used to demonstrate the adaptability and robustness of the proposed trust model. The results are further compared with human-designed fusion methods. The comparison shows that the proposed trust model has a better representation of agent performance, namely convergence speed, than human-designed methods in different scenario settings.

AB Different underwater images captured by different devices may exhibit varying degrees of nonlinear rendering, leading to white balance distortion. Meanwhile, wavelength attenuation and light scattering associated with distance can cause color shifts, reduced visibility, and decreased contrast in underwater images. This will result in difficult access to underwater information, which in turn will affect the application of advanced vision. Considering these degradation issues, we propose a hybrid fusion method for underwater image enhancement, called HFM. In terms of technical contributions, we introduce a color and white balance correction module that addresses color and white balance distortion in underwater images using the gray world principle and a nonlinear color mapping function. We design a visibility recovery module based on type-II fuzzy sets and a contrast enhancement module using curve transformation. Besides, inspired by image fusion methods, we propose an underwater image perception fusion module that focuses on two different tasks simultaneously, fusing underwater images of visibility and contrast. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively solve the problems of white balance distortion, color shift, low visibility and low contrast in underwater images, and achieves optimal results in application tests of geometric rotation estimation, feature point matching and edge detection. Through comparative experiments analyzed on four real scene datasets, the proposed method achieves superior results compared to 14 state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement methods.

AB In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of facility location along with the notion of 'social distancing'. The input to the problem is the road network of a city where the nodes are the residential zones, edges are the road segments connecting the zones along with their respective distance. We also have the information about the population at each zone, different types of facilities to be opened and in which number, and their respective demands in each zone. The goal of the problem is to locate the facilities such that the people can be served and at the same time the total social distancing is maximized. We formally call this problem as the SOCIAL DISTANCING-BASED FACILITy LOCATION PROBLEM. We mathematically quantify social distancing for a given allocation of facilities and proposed an optimization model. As the problem is NP-Hard, we propose three solution methodologies. The first one is a simulation-based approach, the second one is a greedy heuristic, and the third one is a local search heuristic. To validate the proposed solution methodologies, we collect the data from the Food Corporation of India for the city of Kolkata, which happens to be the largest city of eastern India. With this dataset, we perform an extensive set of experiments. From the results, we observe that the proposed local search heuristic allocates facilities that lead to minimum average queue length and greedy heuristic allocates facilities that lead to the maximum social distancing.

AB Increasing the efficiency of an enterprise largely depends on the productivity of its employees, which must be properly assessed and the correct assessment of the contribution of each employee is important. In this regard, this article is devoted to a study conducted by the authors on the development of a digital employee rating system (DERES). The study was conducted on the basis of machine learning technologies and modern assessment methods that will allow companies to evaluate the performance of their departments, analyze the competencies of the employees and predict the rating of employees in the future. The authors developed a 360-degree employee rating model and a rating prediction model using regression machine learning algorithms. The article also analyzed the results obtained using the employee evaluation model, which showed that the performance of the tested employees is reduced due to remote work. Using DERES, a rating analysis of a real business company was carried out with recommendations for improving the efficiency of employees. An analysis of the forecasting results obtained using the rating prediction model developed by the authors showed that personal development and relationship are key parameters in predicting the future rating of employees. In addition, the authors provide a detailed description of the developed DERES information system, main components, and architecture.

AB Dairy is an economically significant industry that caters to the huge demand for food products in people's lives. To remain profitable, farmers need to manage their farms and the health of the dairy cows in their herds. There are, however, many risks to cow health that can lead to significant challenges to dairy farm management and have the potential to lead to significant losses. Such risks include cow udder infections (i.e., mastitis) and cow lameness. As automation and data recording become more common in the agricultural sector, dairy farms are generating increasing amounts of data. Recently, these data are being used to generate insights into farm and cow health, where the objective is to help farmers manage the health and welfare of dairy cows and reduce losses from cow health issues. Despite the level of data generation on dairy farms, this information is often difficult to access due to a lack of a single, central organization to collect data from individual farms. The prospect of such an organization, however, raises questions about data ownership, with some farmers reluctant to share their farm data for privacy reasons. In this study, we describe a new data mesh architecture designed for the dairy industry that focuses on facilitating access to data from farms in a decentralized fashion. This has the benefit of keeping the ownership of data with dairy farmers while bringing data together by providing a common and uniform set of protocols. Furthermore, this architecture will allow secure access to the data by research groups and product development groups, who can plug in new projects and applications built across the data. No similar framework currently exists in the dairy industry, and such a data mesh can help industry stakeholders by bringing the dairy farms of a country together in a decentralized fashion. This not only helps farmers, dairy researchers, and product builders but also facilitates an overview of all dairy farms which can help governments to decide on regulations to improve the dairy industry at a national level.

TI Serious Games Accessibility Design Model for Low-Vision Children

DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK
AB The evolution in information technology has brought worldwide access to information. Information technology has become an approach for effective learning in the education sector. This development provides an opportunity for people with disabilities. However, many educational software and applications in the market, such as serious games, cannot be accessed by low-vision children due to the visual properties in game design. For instance, small text and graphic sizes, lack of colour contrast, complex visual effects, or reliance on visual cues for instructions are among the visual properties that contribute to these accessibility challenges. They can play serious games as long as they are designed based on their accessibility needs. This paper proposed a serious games design model for low-vision children. The three main components are accessibility, game design, and pedagogy. The serious game accessibility design model is implemented using a low-fidelity prototype that takes the form of a serious game mockup. This prototype allows for basic interaction and testing of the game's features, with a focus on accessibility considerations. The expert validation was conducted on the prototype using heuristic evaluation to assess its usability. Based on the evaluation, the experts agreed on implementing the proposed model to the prototype.

TI Source-Free Domain Adaptation via Target Prediction Distribution

   distance; Pairwise alignment
AB Existing Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) methods typically adopt the feature distribution alignment paradigm via mining auxiliary information (eg., pseudo-labelling, source domain data generation). However, they are largely limited due to that the auxiliary information is usually error-prone whilst lacking effective error-mitigation mechanisms. To overcome this fundamental limitation, in this paper we propose a novel Target Prediction Distribution Searching (TPDS) paradigm. Theoretically, we prove that in case of sufficient small distribution shift, the domain transfer error could be well bounded. To satisfy this condition, we introduce a flow of proxy distributions that facilitates the bridging of typically large distribution shift from the source domain to the target domain. This results in a progressive searching on the geodesic path where adjacent proxy distributions are regularized to have small shift so that the overall errors can be minimized. To account for the sequential correlation between proxy distributions, we develop a new pairwise alignment with category consistency algorithm for minimizing the adaptation errors. Specifically, a manifold geometry guided cross-distribution neighbour search is designed to detect the data pairs supporting the Wasserstein distance based shift measurement. Mutual information maximization is then adopted over these pairs for shift regularization. Extensive experiments on five challenging SFDA benchmarks show that our TPDS achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/tntek/TPDS.

AB Textual-based factors have been widely regarded as a promising feature that can be applied to financial issues. This study focuses on extracting both basic and semantic textual features to supplement the traditionally used financial indicators. The main is to improve Chinese listed companies' financial distress prediction (FDP). A unique paradigm is proposed in this study that combines financial and multi-type textual predictive factors, feature selection methods, classifiers, and time spans to achieve the optimal FDP. The frequency counts, TF-IDF, TextRank, and word embedding approaches are employed to extract frequency count-based, keyword-based, sentiment, and readability indicators. The experimental results prove that financial domain sentiment lexicons, word embedding-based readability analysis approaches, and the basic textual features of Management Discussion and Analysis can be important elements of FDP. Moreover, the finding highlights the fact that incorporating financial and textual features can achieve optimal performance 4 or 5 years before the expected baseline year; applying the RF-GBDT combined model can also outperform other classifiers. This study makes an innovative contribution, since it expands the multiple text analysis method in the financial text mining field and provides new findings on how to provide early warning signs related to financial risk. The approaches developed in this research can serve as a template that can be used to resolve other financial issues.

DE Graph convolutional network; Text classification; Part of speech;

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an effective tool for feature clustering. However, in the text classification task, the traditional TextGCN (GCN for Text Classification) ignores the context word order of the text. In addition, TextGCN constructs the text graph only according to the context relationship, so it is difficult for the word nodes to learn an effective semantic representation. Based on this, this paper proposes a text classification method that combines Transformer and GCN. To improve the semantic accuracy of word node features, we add a part of speech (POS) to the word-document graph and build edges between words based on POS. In the layer-to-layer of GCN, the Transformer is used to extract the contextual and sequential information of the text. We conducted the experiment on five representative datasets. The results show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of text classification and is better than the comparison method.

AB Fire stations (FS) are typically non-uniformly distributed across space, and their service area is, in general, defined based on administrative boundaries. Since the location of FS may considerably influence the readiness and the effectiveness of the provided services, national and regional governments need research-based information to adequately plan where to establish firefighting facilities. In this study, we propose a method to reconfigure the fire stations layout using spatial point process models, clustering and space partitioning. First, modelling fire intensity variation across space through a point process model enables to replicate the process independently by simulation. Subsequently, for each simulation, the k-means algorithm is used to define a siting location, minimizing the total within distance between the fire occurrences and the new position. This method allows to obtain a set of locations from which the respective distribution is inferred. Assuming a bivariate normal spatial distribution, we further define confidence siting regions. Ultimately, new FS service areas are defined by Voronoi tessellation. To exemplify the application of the method, we apply it to reconfigure the fire station layout at Aveiro, Portugal.

Nevertheless, the performance of a such method can be easily reduced due to the dizzy environment. To tackle this problem, the global semantics (e.g., background statistics) and the local semantics (e.g., boundary areas) can be utilized to better distinguish foreground objects from the complex background. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively leverage the above two kinds of semantics. For global semantics, two convolutional modules are designed to take advantage of data-level background priors and feature-level multi-scale characteristics, respectively; for local semantics, another module is further put forward to be aware of the semantic edges between foreground and background. The three modules are intertwined with each other, yielding a simple yet effective deep framework named g LObal-LOcal Semantics Coupled Network ( LO(2)Net), which is end-to-end trainable in a scene-specific manner. Benefiting from the LO(2)Net, we achieve superior performance on multiple public datasets, with less supervision trained against several state-of-the-art methods

AB This work presents a neurorobotics model of the brain that integrates the cerebellum and the basal ganglia regions to coordinate movements in a humanoid robot. This cerebellar-basal ganglia circuitry is well known for its relevance to the motor control used by most mammals. Other computational models have been designed for similar applications in the robotics field. However, most of them completely ignore the interplay between neurons from the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Recently, neuroscientists indicated that neurons from both regions communicate not only at the level of the cerebral cortex but also at the subcortical level. In this work, we built an integrated neurorobotics model to assess the capacity of the network to predict and adjust the motion of the hands of a robot in real time. Our model was capable of performing different movements in a humanoid robot by respecting the sensorimotor loop of the robot and the biophysical features of the neuronal circuitry. The experiments were executed in simulation and the real world. We believe that our proposed neurorobotics model can be an important tool for new studies on the brain and a reference toward new robot motor controllers.

AB In order to improve the shortcomings of the traditional monitoring equipment that is difficult to measure the daily physical parameters of the elderly and improve the accuracy of parameter measurement, this article designs wearable devices through the Internet of Things technology and virtual reality technology. With this device, four daily physical parameters of the elderly, such as exercise heart rate, blood pressure, plantar health, and sleep function, are measured. The feasibility of the measurement method and equipment is verified by experiments. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the measurement method based on the reflective photoplethysmography signal was high, with the mean and difference values of the subjects' heart rate basically lying around 0 BPM and in good agreement between the estimated heart rate and the reference value. In the blood pressure measurements, the correlation coefficient between the P-rs estimate and the reference value was 0.81. The estimation accuracy of the device used in the article was high, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.96 +/- 0.02 for subjects' heart rate at rest, and its estimation error rate was 0.02 +/- 0.01. The P-nth value for subject B8 exceeded the threshold of 0.5 before subject B21, and subject B8 had more severe symptoms, which was consistent with the actual situation. The wearable device was able to identify the subject's eye features and provide appropriate videos to help subjects with poor sleep quality to fall asleep. The article provides a method and device that facilitates healthcare professionals to make real-time enquiries and receive user health advice.

AB In this paper, the problem of asynchronous dissipative control for a class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy Markov jump systems with multiple sources disturbances is studied. Compared with the previous conclusions, the parameter uncertainty, time-varying delay and input saturation are taken into account in nonlinear system. And a new fuzzy disturbance rejection control structure is proposed by setting the disturbance observer and controller. The Hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to detect the mode information in the case that the modes mismatch between the system and controller, which ensures that the system is exponentially mean-square stable and has a satisfactory dissipative performance. Then, the sufficient conditions for the stability and dissipative of the augmented system are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the gain matrices of the observer and controller can be directly calculated. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by two examples.

First, this study presents an improved lazy learning algorithm based on k-vector nearest neighbors, which not only considers the matching of input and output data, but also considers the consistency of the model. Based on the optimization index of an additional penalty function, the optimal solution of the lazy learning is obtained by the iterative least-square method. Second, based on the improved lazy learning, an adaptive PID control algorithm is proposed. Finally, the control effect under the condition of complete data and incomplete data is compared by simulation experiment.

AB The extraction of road networks is a critical activity in contemporary transportation networks. Deep neural networks have recently demonstrated excellent performance in the field of road segmentation. However, most of the convolutional neural network (CNN) based architectures could not verify their effectiveness in remote sensing images due to a smaller ratio of the targeted pixels, simple design, and fewer layers.. In this study, a practical approach is assessed for road segmentation. The investigation was begun with basic encoder-decoder based segmentation models. Different state-of-the-art segmentation models like U-Net, V-Net, ResUNet and SegNet were used for road network detection experiments in this research. A robust model named DeepRoadNet, a more complicated alternative, is proposed by utilizing a pre-trained EfficientNetB7 architecture in the encoder and residual blocks as the decoder which mostly resembles the U-Net segmentation process. The proposed model has been trained, validated as well as tested using the high-resolution aerial image datasets and yielded good segmentation results with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 76%, a mean dice coefficient (mDC) of 73.18%, and an accuracy of 97.64% using Massachusetts road dataset. The proposed DeepRoadNet architecture overcomes the issues of lower mIoU, lower mDC, limited flexibility and interpretability already faced by existing models in the road segmentation field. The code is available at Imteaz1998/DeepRoadNet.
   A robust model named DeepRoadNet is proposed by utilizing a pre-trained EfficientNetB7 architecture in the encoder and residual blocks as the decoder. Before that, existing state-of-the-art segmentation models such as U-Net, V-Net, ResUNet, and SegNet are also simulated for road map detection from aerial images . The extensive result analysis of all experiments presents the supremacy of our proposed DeepRoadNet model.image

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in image classification tasks and have achieved remarkable results compared with traditional methods. Their main advantage is the ability to extract hidden features automatically using local connectivity and spatial locality. However, CNN cannot be applied to tabular data, mainly due to the unsuitability of the tabular data structure to the CNN input. In this paper, we propose a new generic method for the representation of multidimensional tabular data as color-encoded images that can be used both for data visualization and classification with CNN. Our approach, named FC-Viz (Feature Clustering-Visualization), is based on user-oriented data visualization ideas, such as pixel-oriented techniques, feature clustering, and feature interactions. The proposed approach includes a transformation of each instance of the tabular data into a 2D pixel-based representation, where pixels representing features with strong correlation and interaction are adjacent to each other. We applied FC-Viz to ten multidimensional tabular datasets with dozens to thousands of features and compared its classification and visualization performance with a state-of-the-art tabular data transformation method. The evaluation experiments show that our approach is as accurate as the state-of-the-art, but with much smaller images resulting in much more compact and faster CNN models.

AB Large amounts of cooling water are required for the cooling process in coal-fired or nuclear power plants. Because the primary use of water in a power plant is to condense steam and remove waste heat as part of a Rankine cycle, seawater temperature (SWT) is of critical importance for electrical output in power plant applications installed at the seaside. Moreover, the analysis of SWT is an important criterion for researching sea life and global climate, and it also serves as an important indicator of climate change. In this paper, multilayer perceptron, which is in the class of a feed-forward artificial neural network, deep learning approach based on long short-term memory and bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks and data-driven methods, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) accompanied by fuzzy c-means, ANFIS with grid partition and ANFIS with subtractive clustering methods were applied to make 1-day ahead SWT predictions. Analyses were conducted using 5-year daily mean SWTs measured by the Turkish State Meteorological Service for Antalya province between 2014 and 2018. The models were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). According to the daily SWT prediction, the best MAE, RMSE, and R values were obtained with the ANFIS-SC model, which were 0.1877 degrees C, 0.2683 degrees C, and 0.99814, respectively.

AB Emotion recognition in the wild (ERW) is a challenging task due to unknown and the unconstrained scenes in the wild environment. Different from previous approaches that use facial expression or posture for ERW, a growing number of researches are beginning to utilize contextual information to improve the performance of emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a new dual-view context-aware network (DVC-Net) to fully explore the usage of contextual information from global and local views, and balance the individual features and context features by introducing the attention mechanism. The proposed DVC-Net consists of three parallel modules: (1) the body-aware stream to suppress the uncertainties of body gesture feature representation, (2) the global context-aware stream based on salient context to capture the global-level effective context, and (3) the local context-aware stream based on graph convolutional network to find the local discriminative features with emotional cues. Quantitative evaluations have been carried out on two in-the-wild emotion recognition datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed DVC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Timely delivery of products to customers is the great importance for retailers in supply chain management. Vending machines are one of the most effective retail tools for consumers to get the product they want at any time. With the developing technology, retailers tend to establish distribution with vending machines to provide faster service to the consumer. At this point, one of the primary objectives is to make the location selection decisions for these vending machines. The most suitable location selection decision includes the evaluation of each alternative under the specified criteria in a problem where there are multiple alternative locations. The present paper proposes a novel modified Delphi-based spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SFAHP) integrated spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (SFCODAS) methodology to the vending machine location selection (VMLS) problem. After determining the main and sub-criteria hierarchically, the Modified Delphi method is used to consolidate the opinions of the experts regarding the criteria and integrate them into the study. The main and sub-criteria weights are provided by the SFAHP method. And the most suitable location is determined by the SFCODAS method by ranking among the alternative locations according to these weighted criteria. The case study of VMLS is presented for a retail firm in Istanbul. Sensitivity analysis is performed to measure the flexibility of the proposed methodology. To validate the applicability of the proposed methodology, comparison analysis is presented with the results of the spherical fuzzy weighted aggregated sum-product assessment (SFWASPAS) method. Finally, the conclusions and future directions are discussed in the study.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-view clustering; Tensor learning; Self-expressiveness learning
AB Tensor-based multi-view clustering has attracted intensive attention due to the effectiveness of exploiting multi-view data information. However, most existing methods purely aim to explore the consistency of different views while neglecting the inherent difference between views, which may lead to incomplete modeling and affect the final clustering performance. To handle this problem, in this paper, we unify the consistency and specificity to model the multi-view data in a tensor manner. Specifically, we learn multiple candidate graphs corresponding to all views through self-expressiveness learning. Then these candidate graphs are decomposed into two sets of graphs, i.e., consistent graphs and specific graphs, respectively. After that, these consistent graphs are stacked into a tensor to exploit the high-order structure information while the specific graphs are used to capture the inherent difference in each view, such that a refined consensus affinity graph can be obtained for spectral clustering. The established model is dubbed Consider High-Order Consistency for Multi-View Clustering (CHOC-MVC), and its optimal problem can be efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/haoranli50/CHOC-MVSC.

AB In challenging scenarios (e.g., small objects and cluttered backgrounds), most existing algorithms suffer from inconsistent results with human visual attention. Since fixation prediction can better model the human visual attention mechanism and has a strong correlation with salient objects. Inspired by this, we proposed a fixation guidance network (FGNet) for salient object detection, which innovatively used fixation prediction to guide both salient object detection and edge detection. Firstly, a multi-branch network structure was designed to achieve multi-task detection. Each branch unit significantly learned the extracted features to accomplish the correct prediction. Secondly, given the strong correlation between the fixation and salient objects, a fixation guidance module was employed to guide salient object detection and edge detection for obtaining more accurate detection results. Finally, to full use the complementary relationship between salient features and edge features, we proposed a multi-resolution feature interaction module to achieve mutual optimization within the same feature and between the different features for suppressing noise and enhancing their representations. The experimental results show that our proposed method performed better in challenging scenes and outperformed existing state-of-the-art algorithms in several metrics on four public benchmark datasets.

AB In this study, a new aggregation operator, called the continuous triangular fuzzy generalized ordered weighted averaging (CTF-GOWA) operator, is proposed for aggregating triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In order to adapt to the uncertainty and complexity of prediction, a differential polymerization method is used, and a special form of CTF-GOWA operator is generated. In particular, the special cases of control parameters and basic unit monotone functions introduced in information aggregation are discussed and its credibility is verified. In addition, the CTF-GOWA operator is applied to the aggregation of multiple TFNs, and various aggregation operators are obtained, including the weighted CTF-GOWA (WCTF-GOWA) operator, the ordered WCTF-GOWA (OWCTF-GOWA) operator, and the combined CTF-GOWA (CCTF-GOWA) operator. Later, the induced variables are added to the OWCTF-GOWA operator to obtain the induced OWCTF-GOWA (IOWCTF-GOWA) operator, which is combined with the cosine similarity degree to construct a combined prediction model about the TFNs. The proposed model has the advantages of less computation, high accuracy, and more adaptability to the actual situation. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified by illustrative examples. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are also implemented to assess the stability and validity of our method.

AB The multi-cloud environment (MCE) serves users on-demand by presenting miscellaneous online web services. Each web service which is delivered by every cloud provider has its own quality of features and also own pricing scheme. In the web service composition technology, the integration of the services required by the users is done with the aim of producing the efficient solutions with the desired quality. In some businesses, continuity of activities is very important and a business that fails a lot cannot be trusted by subscribers. In these businesses, it is necessary to maximize the reliability of the system along with minimizing the overall monetary costs. To this end, two new reliability and cost models are presented. All of the network equipment, communication, and elements affecting the total cost and reliability of the system are taken into consideration in the proposed models. Then, the web service composition issue is formulated to a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this combinatorial problem in large search space of MCE, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is suggested to maximize reliability while minimizing the cost of services and make Pareto optimal points. The results of the evaluations show that in different scenarios, the proposed solution proves the amount of 48%, 46%, and 12% averagely improvement over other comparative MOGWO, NSGA-II, and MOEA/D approaches in terms of service failure rate, service implementation cost in cloud providers, and the execution time respectively.

AB Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a widely employed medical imaging technique that produces detailed anatomical images of the human body. The segmentation of MR images plays a crucial role in medical image analysis, as it enables accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of various diseases and conditions. Due to the lack of sufficient medical images, it is challenging to achieve an accurate segmentation, especially with the application of deep learning networks. The aim of this work is to study transfer learning from T1-weighted (T1-w) to T2-weighted (T2-w) MR sequences to enhance bone segmentation with minimal required computation resources. With the use of an excitation-based convolutional neural networks, four transfer learning mechanisms are proposed: transfer learning without fine tuning, open fine tuning, conservative fine tuning, and hybrid transfer learning. Moreover, a multi-parametric segmentation model is proposed using T2-w MR as an intensity-based augmentation technique. The novelty of this work emerges in the hybrid transfer learning approach that overcomes the overfitting issue and preserves the features of both modalities with minimal computation time and resources. The segmentation results are evaluated using 14 clinical 3D brain MR and CT images. The results reveal that hybrid transfer learning is superior for bone segmentation in terms of performance and computation time with DSCs of 0.5393 +/- 0.0007. Although T2-w-based augmentation has no significant impact on the performance of T1-w MR segmentation, it helps in improving T2-w MR segmentation and developing a multi-sequences segmentation model.

AB Existing deep learning methods cannot achieve satisfactory ship license plate (SLP) recognition due to the harsh marine environment, such as foggy weather, unstable ship state and small targets. Therefore, a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)-based method is proposed for accurate SLP image recognition. Overall, the suggested method improves a CRNN recognition model by SLP image enhancement and data augmentation. The SLP image enhancement employs dark channel prior and Hough transform line detector to address the fog/blurriness and tilt issues existing in SLP images. As separate and joint operations, the two enhancements contribute to data augmentation for CRNN recognition. Preprocessing algorithms, including adaptive histogram equalization and image edge padding, are used to improve and unify the enlarged dataset for augmenting the CRNN model. As a final step, correction of the CRNN recognition results is made according to the character rule of SLPs, using an edit-distance algorithm to match against a pre-established SLP dictionary. A variety of real SLP images were collected to build an SLP image dataset for verification. The experimental results indicate that our method can reach an SLP recognition accuracy of similar to 93%$\sim 93\%$, which is significantly superior to other text-based deep learning methods.
   A novel CRNN-based method for Chinese ship license plate recognition under harsh marine environment is reported. This method can achieve significant recognition accuracy.image

AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) can obtain pseudo-semantic masks through a weaker level of supervised labels, reducing the need for costly pixel-level annotations. However, the general class activation map (CAM)-based pseudo-mask acquisition method suffers from sparse coverage, leading to false positive and false negative regions that reduce accuracy. We propose a WSSS method based on local superpixel transformation that combines superpixel theory and image local information. Our method uses a superpixel local consistency weighted cross-entropy loss to correct erroneous regions and a post-processing method based on the adjacent superpixel affinity matrix (ASAM) to expand false negatives, suppress false positives, and optimize semantic boundaries. Our method achieves 73.5% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 validation set, which is 2.5% higher than our baseline EPS and 73.9% on the test set, and the ASAM post-processing method is validated on several state-of-the-art methods. If our paper is accepted, our code will be published at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SPL.

AB The finite-time synchronization (FTS) is investigated in this paper for delayed fractional-order quaternion-valued Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (FQVCGNNs). First, a fractional-order finite-time stability theorem is established by using the definition of fractional-order integral and reduction to absurdity. Next, two novel quaternion-valued feedback controller and quaternion-valued adaptive controller are designed respectively to achieve the FTS of FQVCGNNs. Then, without the participation of sign function, applying the non-decomposition method, the established finite-time stability theorem and constructing suitable quaternion-valued Lyapunov function, some less conservative and easily verifiable criteria are presented to ensure the FTS of the addressed system. Meanwhile, the settling time of FTS is effectively estimated, which depends on the controller parameters and the fractional order of the considered system. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show the validity of the obtained results.

ID SCIENCE; ACCEPTANCE
AB In this study, we analyse the public perception of military AI in Estonia, a techno-optimistic country with high support for science and technology. This study involved quantitative survey data from 2021 on the public's attitudes towards AI-based technology in general, and AI in developing and using weaponised unmanned ground systems (UGS) in particular. UGS are a technology that has been tested in militaries in recent years with the expectation of increasing effectiveness and saving manpower in dangerous military tasks. However, developing weaponised systems often raises questions about their safety and accountability. While there have been public debates about the possible outcomes of AI-based civilian technologies like self-driving cars, equivalent discussions have not been held about military technologies. A discourse on potentially sensitive technologies can diminish biased representations and the distribution of worst-case scenarios. The results of this study reveal that an overall positive attitude towards AI-driven technologies is related to a positive perception of military AI systems. However, trustworthiness and human control are the main aspects that are expected from military technologies.

AB The application of machine learning promises great growth potential for industrial production. The development process of a machine learning solution for industrial use cases requires multi-layered, sophisticated decision-making processes along the pipeline that can only be accomplished by subject matter experts with knowledge of statistical mathematics, coding, and engineering process knowledge. By having humans and computers work together in a digital assistance system, the special characteristics of human and artificial intelligence can be used synergistically. This paper presents the development of a digital human-centered assistance system for employees in the production and development departments of industrial manufacturing companies. This assistance system enables users to apply production-specific data mining and machine learning techniques without programming to typical tabular production data, which is often inherently high-dimensional, nonstationary, and highly imbalanced data streams. Through tight interactive process guidance that considers the dependencies between machine learning process modules, users are empowered to build and optimize predictive models. Compared to existing commercial and academic tools with similar objectives, the digital assistance system offers the added value that both classical shallow and deep learning as well as generative and oversampling methods can be interactively applied to all feature table use cases for different user modes without programming.

AB Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an essential task in ensuring reliability in intelligent manufacturing. Recent advances in deep learning-based data-driven methods have shown promising results. However, one non-ignorable challenge is that distribution shift across various machine individuals often results in a performance decline. Domain adaptation approaches appear to be effective in tackling this issue, whereas they often require sufficient unlabeled target data, which is causally infeasible in prognostic tasks in practical scenarios. In this paper, we discuss the significance of prognostic generalization for RUL prediction, and a domain generalization-based scheme is proposed. A domain conditional invariance and specificity disentanglement network (DCISD) is proposed to learn domain conditional-invariant and domain-specific information simultaneously in a unified network. Domain conditional-invariant features are extracted through conditional domain adversarial learning and samples are conditioned by multiple RUL fuzzy sets. Domain-specific features correlated to individual degradation patterns are disentangled to promote sufficiency of degradation information. Moreover, a degradation dynamics-based augmentation method is proposed to mitigate domain imbalance following the degradation dynamics in the latent space. Two bearing run-to-failure datasets are utilized to evaluate the proposed method. Comparative and ablation studies validate the method effectiveness and superiority.

AB Contamination can severely distort an estimator unless the estimation procedure is suitably robust. This is a well-known issue and has been addressed in Robust Statistics, however, the relation of contamination and distorted variable selection has been rarely considered in the literature. As for variable selection, many methods for sparse model selection have been proposed, including the Stability Selection which is a meta-algorithm based on some variable selection algorithm in order to immunize against particular data configurations. We introduce the variable selection breakdown point that quantifies the number of cases resp. cells that have to be contaminated in order to let no relevant variable be detected. We show that particular outlier configurations can completely mislead model selection. We combine the variable selection breakdown point with resampling, resulting in the Stability Selection breakdown point that quantifies the robustness of Stability Selection. We propose a trimmed Stability Selection which only aggregates the models with the best performance so that, heuristically, models computed on heavily contaminated resamples should be trimmed away. An extensive simulation study with non-robust regression and classification algorithms as well as with two robust regression algorithms reveals both the potential of our approach to boost the model selection robustness as well as the fragility of variable selection using non-robust algorithms, even for an extremely small cell-wise contamination rate.

AB This article presents a novel concept of complex cubic picture fuzzy sets (CCPFS) and introduces one more new idea of complex interval-valued picture fuzzy sets (CIVPFS) as foundational framework of CCPFS. The proposed CCPFS combines CIVPFS and complex picture fuzzy sets (CPFS), where CPFS extends the complex intuitionistic fuzzy set by incorporating a neutral membership degree. This unique model offers an expanded range of values using degrees of membership, neutral membership, and non-membership, within the unit disk of a complex plane. Additionally, we introduce two more new ideas of internal complex cubic picture fuzzy sets (ICCPFS) and external complex cubic picture fuzzy sets (ECCPFS) to further enhance the versatility of the approach. To facilitate practical applications, complement, score, and accuracy functions are developed and defined for CCPFS. Moreover, three types of averaging aggregation operators based on complex cubic picture fuzzy sets are introduced, including complex cubic picture fuzzy weighted geometric (CCPFWG) operators, complex cubic picture fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (CCPFOWG) operator, and complex cubic picture fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric (CCPFHWG) operator. The CCPFHWG operator generalizes both CCPFWG and CCPFOWG operators, providing a comprehensive framework for aggregating complex cubic picture fuzzy data. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem is presented, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing today's complex decision structures. The utilization of complex cubic picture fuzzy sets and the corresponding aggregation operators in MCDM highlights their applicability and relevance in tackling real-world complexities.

AB Based on the framework of differential inclusion, we design a quaternion-valued neural network (QVNN) to solve a class of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems with equality, bounded and inequality constraints in quaternion domain. The modeling of the network avoids the calculation of penalty factors and guarantees the convergence in finite time to the feasible region and the sets of critical points of the nonconvex optimization problems. The global existence of the state solution of the network can be obtained by nonsmooth analysis. Our approach is directly used to solve nonconvex optimization problems over quaternion domain without splitting them into real or complex domain, and the theoretical results about convergence are also completely established in quaternion domain. Additionally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed quaternion-valued neural network approach are demonstrated by numerical experiments and the application of attitude estimation for micro quadrotor.

DE Generative adversarial network (GAN); text generation
AB Text generative models trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) suffer from the notorious exposure bias problem, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are shown to have potential to tackle this problem. The existing language GANs adopt estimators, such as REINFORCE or continuous relaxations to model word probabilities. The inherent limitations of such estimators lead current models to rely on pretraining techniques (MLE pretraining or pretrained embeddings). Representation modeling methods (RMMs), which are free from those limitations, however, are seldomly explored because of their poor performance in previous attempts. Our analyses reveal that invalid sampling methods and unhealthy gradients are the main contributors to such unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present two techniques to tackle these problems: dropout sampling and fully normalized long short-term memory network (LSTM). Based on these two techniques, we propose InitialGAN whose parameters are randomly initialized in full. Besides, we introduce a new evaluation metric, least coverage rate (LCR), to better evaluate the quality of generated samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the InitialGAN outperforms both MLE and other compared models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a language GAN can outperform MLE without using any pretraining techniques.

AB Here we consider the problem of predicting falls using real data from human stick balancing experiments implementing k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and a neural network. Carrying out two different approaches to evaluate the temporal series, it is shown that, in one case, prefall segments can be classified with an F1 score larger than 0.97, using the neural network and the random forest; being able to detect changes in the pattern preceding a fall around 0.83 s before. An additional approach can identify the temporal position of fall precursors in a best-case scenario with an F1 score > 0.9, using the neural network, at times around 0.83 s before. In general, we found that the classifiers behave well when dealing with this complex classification task. Best performing methods in both approaches coincide in determining a falling precursor at 0.83 s before the escape - coinciding with previous results. These results may help establishing a reference for future works using other algorithms best suited to predict complex temporal series.

AB This work analyses the most relevant research conducted under the mobile cloud computing paradigm to bring vision tasks supported by state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks closer to the end-user through collaborative intelligence. In particular, this review aims to comprehensively address collaborative inference on convolutional networks, offering the reader a detailed explanation of the main methods and technologies used to partition and deploy such models on the UE-edge-cloud continuum, which have made it possible to leverage the capabilities of resource-constrained devices to alleviate, and ideally eliminate, the traditional dependence on the cloud for high-performance computing, thereby enabling a more rational exploitation of the supporting hardware infrastructure. The paper details the technical aspects of the different frameworks designed to support these tasks, examining and comparing the mechanisms and techniques used to conceive pertinent configurations. Moreover, the study outlines the various algorithmic solutions developed for synthesizing optimal co-inference schemes, also covering the design conventions adopted and the tweaks implemented to optimize the overall performance delivered, concluding with a discussion of the specific challenges that have arisen thus far, as well as the following steps to be taken in this field.

TI Spatial constraint for efficient semi-supervised video object

LA English
DT Article
DE Video object segmentation; Memory-based methods; Redundant information;
   Semantically similar objects
AB Semi-supervised video object segmentation is the process of tracking and segmenting objects in a video sequence based on annotated masks for one or more frames. Recently, memory-based methods have attracted a significant amount of attention due to their strong performance. Having too much redundant information stored in memory, however, makes such methods inefficient and inaccurate. Moreover, a global matching strategy is usually used for memory reading, so these methods are susceptible to interference from semantically similar objects and are prone to incorrect segmentation. We propose a spatial constraint network to overcome these problems. In particular, we introduce a time-varying sensor and a dynamic feature memory to adaptively store pixel information to facilitate the modeling of the target object, which greatly reduces information redundancy in the memory without missing critical information. Furthermore, we propose an efficient memory reader that is less computationally intensive and has a smaller footprint. More importantly, we introduce a spatial constraint module to learn spatial consistency to obtain more precise segmentation; the target and distractors can be identified by the learned spatial response. The experimental results indicate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. Our method also achieves an approximately 30 FPS inference speed, which is close to the requirement for real-time systems.

DE Information extraction; Contrastive learning; Named entity recognition;

ID ENTITY RECOGNITION; HAZARD ANALYSIS; ONTOLOGY
AB Typically named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) from safety documentation (e.g., accident reports) adopt a pipeline processing approach whereby tasks are split into two sub-tasks. As a result, error propagation occurs between components, and useful information from one task may go unexploited by the other. Additionally, training sets to perform NER and RE from safety documentation are often limited and contextspecific. Thus, our research addresses the following question: How can we accurately identify entities and extract relations from safety documentation using limited training sets? This paper utilizes 'contrastive learning' to tackle our research question. It proposes a contrastive learning-based cascade binary tagging framework (CasRel) to automatically and synchronously extract entities and relations from safety documents. A five-fold cross-validation process is used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach. Results from the validation process achieve an average precision of 77.8%, recall of 58.7%, and F1-score of 66.9%, outperforming CasRel with an increase of about 10% in precision, 5% in recall, and 7% in F1-score. Thus, our approach can accurately recognize entities and extract relations from safety documentation. The contributions of our study are twofold: (1) an improved unified model is developed to recognize and extract the entity and relation from safety documents to reduce error propagation and improve its accuracy; and (2) the concept of 'contrastive learning' is introduced in the design of the joint entity and relation extraction model with limited training sets.

AB Automatic aggregation of similar words into semantically related groups (or clusters) is of interest to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Extracting semantically related words and quasi-synonyms from text is a relatively new research area for the under-resourced Arabic language. Previous attempts addressed the problem of single-word term extraction. However, the absence of multiword terms (MWTs) dictionary, ontology, and semantic network makes extracting and identifying high-quality MWTs for the Arabic language a challenging problem. The main goal of this study is to extract corpus-based and coherent MWTs in the form of bigram and trigram sequences as an adequate representation of syntactic and semantic clusters. Therefore, this study contributes to this problem by implementing an algorithm named SEWAR, which uses the FastText algorithm to extract high-quality MWTs from a medical health corpus in Arabic. If put into practice, SEWAR can provide a suitable and helpful solution to classify and direct medical health questions to proper medical practitioners without human intervention. In addition, SEWAR can be applied to plenty of NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization. Three metrics were used to assess the extracted MWTs; the pointwise mutual information (PMI), the cosine similarity, and the clustering purity measure. The results were promising and encouraging to generalize and apply SEWAR to extract MWTs from any Arabic corpus.

AB With the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increasing on a global scale, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has become crucial in maximizing the survival rate of cardiac arrest patients. However, the feasibility of widespread CPR training remains limited at present, in part owing to the high costs required to equip manikins with feedback functions. We therefore propose a deep learning technology designed to provide a low-cost CPR education. Our model converts chest compression (CC) videos captured via smartphone into appropriate images, and provides feedback on four core components of high-quality CPR: CC count, maximum compression depth of CCs, complete chest release following compression, and incorrect hand positions of CCs. To reduce the complexity of video processing, we conducted a composite-image-based evaluation for time independent tasks. Our proposed architecture achieved satisfactory performance on all tasks, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Moreover, by focusing on educational context, our approach helps expand educational opportunities and enhance CPR training. By allowing many individuals to simultaneously receive CPR training in an optimized educational environment, we can ultimately improve the survival rate of cardiac arrest patients.

AB Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is regarded as the best visualization of retinal vasculature and is widely used. However, the acquisition of OCTA is still limited by the device. In this study, we aim to generate OCTA from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for devices without the OCTA imaging module. We proposed a novel unsupervised 3D domain adaption approach, termed Patch-based 3D Multi-scale Feature Adaption Networks (PMFAN), to transfer the OCTA generator trained on one device to other devices. To perform domain adaption, we first map the OCT of different devices to shared-feature spaces. To maintain fine-grained vessel features, we encode the OCT into a set of multi-scale feature codes. Besides, we model the domain adaption in 3D with a patch-based data manner. To reduce inaccurate feature coding due to incomplete context at the border of patches, we propose a novel context-enhanced encoder. Then, we generate OCTA from the feature codes by a domain-invariant OCTA generator. The experimental results on a dataset from two devices demonstrate that our method outperforms other unsupervised domain adaptation methods and image-translation-based methods in terms of the cross-device OCT to OCTA translation.

DE Concept induction; Explainable AI; Class hierarchy
AB Concept induction, which is based on formal logical reasoning over description logics, has been used in ontology engineering in order to create ontology (TBox) axioms from the base data (ABox) graph. In this paper, we show that it can also be used to explain data differentials, for example in the context of Explainable AI (XAI), and we show that it can in fact be done in a way that is meaningful to a human observer. Our approach utilizes a large class hierarchy, curated from the Wikipedia category hierarchy, as background knowledge. To make the explanations easily understandable for non-specialists, the complex description logic explanations generated by our concept induction system (ECII) were presented as a word list consisting of the concept names occurring in the highest rated system responses.

ID INFORMATION
AB Deep learning is vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks in which an attacker can easily embed a hidden backdoor into a trained model by injecting poisoned samples into the training set. Many prior state-of-the-art techniques for detecting backdoor poisoning attacks are based on a potential separability assumption. However, current adaptive poisoning strategies can significantly reduce 'distinguishable behavior', making most prior state-of-the-art techniques less effective. In addition, we note that existing detection methods are not practical for multidomain datasets and may leak user privacy because they require and collect clean samples. To address the above issues, we propose a multidomain active defense approach that does not use clean datasets. The proposed approach can generate diverse clean samples from different domains and decouple neural networks round by round using clean samples to disassociate features and labels, making backdoor poisoned samples easier to detect without fitting clean samples. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach through an extensive evaluation of CIFAR10, CelebA, MNIST & MNIST-M, MNIST & USPS & MNIST-M, MNIST & USPS & SVHN and CIFAR10 & Tiny-ImageNet.

AB The crossbar array design method based on a single memristor provides an excessive writing error and cannot achieve the network's requirements for the generation of image captions. In order to solve this problem, this paper highlights the following techniques. (1) A crossbar array of memristor modules is built, and the writing error is theoretically reduced to a maximum of 0.0619%0. (2) A method of linearly mapping the weights of neural networks to memristance values is proposed, and a memristive neural network based on a memristor module is designed. (3) A neural image caption generator based on VGG-16-LSTM is designed in light of the crossbar array of the memristor module. The design can achieve a maximum of 99.38% of the reference network in BLEU scoring performance. The performance of neural networks based on memristor modules under different input conditions is discussed, and the paper's best hardware design scheme, named it-10, is proposed. The it-8 simulation can obtain 97.37% of the reference network in BLEU scoring performance, and it requires far less demanding input conditions. Moreover, this paper finds a way to design a novel crossbar array based on the memristor module and make a breakthrough in memristive neural network solution for the cross-modal image caption generation task.

AB Accurate tumor segmentation of multi-modality PET/CT images plays a vital role in computer-aided cancer diagnosis and treatment. It is crucial to rationally fuse the complementary information in multi-modality PET/CT segmentation. However, existing methods usually lack interpretability and fail to sufficiently identify and aggregate critical information from different modalities. In this study, we proposed a novel segmentation framework that incorporated an interpretation module into the multi-modality segmentation backbone. The interpretation module highlighted critical features from each modality based on their contributions to the segmentation performance. To provide explicit supervision for the interpretation module, we introduced a novel interpretation loss with two fusion schemes: strengthened fusion and perturbed fusion. The interpretation loss guided the interpretation module to focus on informative features, enhancing its effectiveness in generating meaningful interpretable masks. Under the guidance of the interpretation module, the proposed approach can fully exploit meaningful features from each modality, leading to better integration of multi-modality information and improved segmentation performance. Ablative and comparative experiments were conducted on two PET/CT tumor segmentation datasets. The proposed approach surpassed the baseline by 1.4 and 1.8 Dices on two datasets, respectively, indicating the improvement achieved by the interpretation method. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed the best comparison approach by 0.9 and 0.6 Dices on two datasets, respectively. In addition, visualization and perturbation experiments further illustrated the effectiveness of the interpretation method in highlighting critical features.

AB In this paper, two aims are sought. First, the path to a minimum-error colour calibration and its feasibility for non-invasive cultural heritage conservation is explored. Using RGB information as temporal cues of the conservation state of the pieces under monitoring, an adaptive calibration function, working in syntony with a colour calibration chart destined to general usage, has been proposed. Since the context involves citizen participation, the pictures to calibrate are crowdsourced and the cameras of origin unknown; therefore, the requirements of the work context assume images that imply a heavy colorimetric uncertainty whilst maintaining their structural content. Therefore,a differentiable, multidimensional, adaptive transfer curve that offers the best trade-off between calibration error (staying in minimum perceivable colour differences for tangible materials) and calculation requirements is refined. The conception of this system offers flexible possibilities of an effective cultural heritage conservation without heavy costs on money and human effort or relying on external solutions, while standing on par in quality with state-of-art technologies, achieving therefore a balance between generalist usage and specific solutions. Secondly, a neural network-based final process performs the final tuning of the calibration functions, and its conclusions shed light on how a calibration process works together with the colour chart on an algebraic level. The verification of this phenomenon opens possibilities of different paths on how to proceed with colour calibrations depending on the conditions of acquisition and the content of interest, so the minimum error can be always achieved regardless of the case. The ideas presented here are an expansion and conclusion of the developments and results previously published by the same authors.

   influencing analysis; Link prediction; Fuzzy relation
AB Despite the importance of link prediction and identification of influencers in dynamic social media systems, the existing methodical theories are not capable of analyzing complex multilayer relations in social media networks which contain uncertainty. In fact, there is no theoretical exploration concurrently focused on multidimensional and interrelated entities in a fuzzy-based social media environment. To cover this gap, a neoteric generalized fuzzy hypergraph (GFH) methodology is designed using developed n-ary fuzzy relation technique that is the extension of convolutional binary fuzzy relation. Characterizing reflexive, symmetric, transitive, composition, t-cut and support techniques is carried out for multidimensional uncertain-based space. Also, a graphical approach is created in the generalized fuzzy hypergraph to assist the derivation of foundational implications and concepts. The GFH framework can be applied for the intelligent management of complex systems for sole or mass users of local and global social media platforms by adopting specific membership degree for each individual. To predict the linkages between elements, a fuzzy-based indicator FLP (fuzzy link prediction) is promoted, along with the indicator of SIR (score of interaction rate) to identify the influencers (strongest communicators) in an uncertain space. Through the FLP evaluation, the extracted data are analyzed as per the highest value of 1 for single, 3 for binary, 3.8 for triplet, and 0.9 for quaternary spaces for their probable links. Through the analysis of SIR data on the individuals' membership degrees for the usage of social media platforms, the highest interaction value of 0.99 is correlated to a single member, while 5.42 magnitude addresses an influential person. The performance results show that the presented theoretical and structural approach, that is superior to the classical graph theories, is promising to configure intelligent expert systems, predict the likelihood of connections, detect communities, and specify the influencers in real social media platforms that contain uncertainty.

AB The proposed theme of this paper is to develop a system for remote intervention assistance with a person in difficulty, which is becoming increasingly important as the world's population ages. The goal is to provide effective long-term care to reduce hospitalizations of the elderly and alleviate the burden of care for hospitals and governments. The system requires careful consideration of costs, resources, and efficiency due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the data involved, making human analysis nearly impossible. To enable machine analysis and decision-making, the proposed system is based on an ontological approach that combines medical, social, temporary, and geographical factors, along with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). The system is further enhanced by the integration of probabilistic reasoning through Probabilistic Web Ontology Language (PR-OWL), which allows for the use of ontological resources in a probabilistic environment. The paper also proposes two additional approaches in the form of Jena Application Programming Interfaces (API), including ontological enrichment based on Bayesian Network (BN) knowledge bases and structural/parametric learning based on ontological knowledge bases, as well as a probabilistic clause integrated into the ontological format. As results, the proposed approaches were tested in a simulation, and feedback was collected from users. The feedback was compared, and an increase in precision was observed from one approach to another with varying execution times. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for remote intervention assistance and provide a foundation for future research and development in this area.

TI A machine learning study for predicting driver goals in contingencies

ID SITUATION-AWARENESS; EYE; MODEL
AB Many studies have focused on decision support systems that enhance both the efficiency and safety of driving. They have also explored the potential of real-time psychological data and machine learning in predicting drivers' cognitive state, such as their fatigue levels, drowsiness, or workload. However, few studies have investigated prediction of driving goals as a cognitive outcome. Early prediction plays an essential role in providing active decision support during driving events under time pressure conditions. In this study, machine learning algorithms and features associated with different phases of decision-making were used to predict two common driving goals: defensive driving in emerging scenarios and urgent reactions in nonroutine scenarios. The effects of perception-, reflex-, control-, and kinetic-related features and how they contribute to prediction in the context of decision-making were analyzed. A total of 49 individuals were recruited to complete simulated driving tasks, with 237 events of defensive driving and 271 events of urgent reactions identified. The results revealed premium recall with a naive Bayes classifier, indicating the onset of decision-making, with extreme gradient boosting and random forests exhibiting superior precision in predicting defensive driving and urgent reactions, respectively. Additionally, the cutoff of the initial 0.4 s of the events was identified. Before the cutoff, the leading features were reflex-and control-related features, which were the drivers' immediate reactions before scenario evaluation and goal determination. These leading features contributed to superior prediction results for the two types of driving goals, indicating the likelihood of early detection. After the cutoff, model performance decreased, and lagging features came into play. These lagging features comprised perception-and kinetic-related features, reflecting observation of cues and outcomes of inputs delivered to vehicles. In the first 2 s, predictive models recovered and stabilized.

TI UCFilTransNet: Cross-Filtering Transformer-based network for CT image

AB U-Net is a common segmentation model and achieves good segmentation results, but U-Net has a large semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. In addition, both high-frequency information (details like boundaries) and low-frequency information (shape, etc.) are critical for segmentation tasks. To address these problems, this work proposes a transformer-based model (UCFilTransNet). Specifically, UCFilTransNet designs a Cross-Filter Transformer (CFTrans) Block between the encoder and decoder to fuse the multi -scale feature information extracted from the encoder to improve segmentation accuracy. Considering the characteristics of various frequencies, UCFilTransNet redesigns the transformer structure from the standpoint of the frequency domain to enhance local information and build long-range dependencies. To augment the global information, UCFilTransNet develops a residual pyramid squeeze-excitation (RPSA) module in the bottleneck. This work demonstrates that UCFilTransNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on two datasets. More importantly, it only has few model parameters (24.88M) and low computational complexity (19.71G). A large number of experiments prove that the proposed CFTrans and RPSA modules are effective for CT image segmentation.

AB Due to the comprehensive impact of external factors (politics, economy, market, etc.) and internal factors (organizational structure, management ability, innovation capability, etc.), stock series exhibit strong volatility. Coupled with their inherent high liquidity, it poses great challenges for stock series prediction. However, the previous stock series forecasting methods often only pay attention to the long-term dependencies, and lack attention to the local features and short-term dependencies. In this regard a stock series prediction model based on variational mode decomposition and dual-channel attention network is proposed, which is called VMD-LSTMA+TCNA. To prevent information leakage, the stock series is divided into equal-length sub-windows by sliding window. To reduce the series volatility, each sub-window is decomposed into different frequency mode sub-windows through variational mode decomposition (VMD). To improve the prediction accuracy and robustness in different stock markets, we construct a dual-channel attention model called LSTMA+TCNA. The LSTMA channel is used to extract long-term dependencies and temporally correlated features, while the TCNA channel is used to extract local patterns and short-term dependencies, and self-attention is added to both channels to increase the weight of features at important times. Predict each frequency mode sub-window separately through the specific LSTMA and TCNA channels, and then obtain the predicted values by fusing the results of dual-channel. The final predicted stock series is obtained by superimposing the predicted values of each frequency mode sub-window. Through extensive experiments on the US and Hong Kong stock markets, it has been shown that the VMD-LSTMA+TCNA model exhibits better robustness and generalization compared to other state-of-the-art methods and has higher prediction accuracy.

AB Existing cross-collection topic models with document-topic representation encounter performance bottlenecks in large-scale datasets due to their reliance on Dirichlet priors and conventional inference schemes. These constraints become noticeable in models derived from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) framework. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the GPU-accelerated cross-collection latent generalized Dirichlet allocation (gccLGDA) model. This innovative approach integrates the benefits of generalized Dirichlet (GD) distribution with the computational prowess of GPU-based parallel inference, offering enhanced cross collection topic modeling. The gccLGDA employs the GD distribution presenting a more flexible prior with a comprehensive covariance structure, enabling a more nuanced capture of relationships between latent topics across different collections. Leveraging GPU for parallel inference, our model promises scalable and efficient training for expansive datasets, making it apt for large-scale data challenges. Through empirical evaluations in comparative text mining and document classification, we demonstrate the enhanced performance of the gccLGDA, highlighting its advantages over existing cross-collection topic models.

AB Algorithmic trading enables the execution of orders using a set of rules determined by a computer program. Orders are submitted based on an asset's expected price in the future, an approach well suited for high-volatility markets, such as those trading in cryptocurrencies. The goal of this study is to find a reliable and profitable model to predict the future direction of a crypto asset's price based on publicly available historical data. We first develop a novel labeling scheme and map this problem into a Machine Learning classification problem. The model is then validated on three major cryptocurrencies through an extensive backtest over a bull, bear and flat market. Finally, the contribution of each feature to the classification output is analyzed.

AB A well-known obstacle in the successful implementation of deep learning-based systems to real-world problems is the performance degradation that occurs when applying a network that was trained on data collected in one domain, to data from a different domain. In this study, we focus on the Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) setup where we assume the availability of a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. Our approach is based on transferring the gradient history of the pre-training phase to the fine-tuning phase in addition to the parameter set to improve the generalization achieved during pre-training while fine-tuning the model. We present two schemes to transfer the gradient's information. Mixed Minibatch Transfer Learning (MMTL) is based on using examples from both the source and target domains and Optimizer-Continuation Transfer Learning (OCTL) preserves the gradient history when shifting from training to fine-tuning. This approach is also applicable to the more general setup of transfer learning across different tasks. We show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art at different levels of data scarcity from the target domain, on multiple datasets and tasks involving both scenery and medical images.

AB Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an active area of research that leverages multimodal signals for affective understanding of user-generated videos. Existing research tends to develop sophisticated fusion techniques to fuse unimodal representations into multimodal representation and treat MSA as a single prediction task. However, we find that the text modality with the pre-trained model (BERT) learn more semantic information and dominates the training in multimodal models, inhibiting the learning of other modalities. Besides, the classification ability of each modality is also suppressed by single-task learning. In this paper, We propose a text guided multi-task learning network to enhance the semantic information of non-text modalities and improve the learning ability of unimodal networks. We conducted experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis datasets, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. The results show that our method outperforms the current SOTA method.

TI Predicting diversification scores of videos in recommendation network

AB Recommendation systems are crucial in various platforms from shopping to online social networks. A key challenge in recommendation systems is to leverage diversity, exposing or recommending diverse items to individuals. Despite much effort on studying diversity in the recommendation systems, little work has focused on estimating how much an item will potentially affect user's diversity experiences by contributing to consecutive recommendations in a session. In this work, we propose a deep learning model that can predict diversification scores, which is a degree of potential contribution to users' diversity experiences of an item. The proposed model adopts multiple graph neural network layers with a novel attention mechanism that can capture the features of a given item and its related items in terms of recommendation. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a large dataset of video recommendations from YouTube and conduct random-walk experiments to simulate user traces. The evaluation results on the dataset shows that the proposed model accurately predicts each item's contribution on user diversity experiences.

ID RESISTANCE
AB This paper proposes a novel physics-informed machine learning method to build grey-box model (GBM) predicting ship speed for ocean crossing ships. In this method, the expected ship speed in calm water is first modeled by the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based on speed-power model tests. Then the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm is integrated to estimate ship speed reduction under actual weather conditions. The proposed GBM has been compared against the traditional black-box model (BBM) using performance monitoring data from two ships. The results show that when the amount of data is sufficient for modeling, the GBM can increase the accuracy of speed prediction by about 30%. When data volume is limited, the GBM can also significantly improve the prediction results. Finally, the GBM is validated by checking its implementation for the ETA predictions of cross-Pacific or North Atlantic voyages. The highest cumulative error of sailing time estimated by the GBM is 5 h among all the study cases.

TI Hierarchical Siamese network for real-time visual tracking
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Visual tracking; Hierarchical convolutional features; Siamese network
AB Siamese trackers have recently achieved remarkable performance in visual tracking community. However, they mainly utilize features from a certain convolutional layer for feature representation, which is not discriminative enough for dealing with complicated scenarios, especially in presence of background distraction and high precise localization. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical Siamese tracking network to address this issue, the presented network exploits multiple levels of convolutional layers cascaded from deeper layers to earlier layers for discriminative tracker performance. For taking advantage of deep and shallow features effectively, we design a pyramid feature fusion module to fuse them, thus the capability of the tracker is improved and can better distinguish the target from background. To further improve the robustness of the tracker, we design the location-aware prediction heads by defining the bounding box regression and cascading from high-level to low-level layers for the proposed hierarchical Siamese network, that maintains precise localization for tracking. Experimental results on visual tracking benchmarks, including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB2015, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results and runs at 34.2FPS, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency.

AB In this paper, an optimization method based on the combination of Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex concepts and charged system search algorithm (CSS) is proposed and called NM-CSS. NM, as a search technique, involves the iterative formation and transformation of a geometrically arranged set of points known as a simplex to uncover the optimal solution. By incorporating NM into metaheuristic algorithms, the convergence speed and solution quality can be notably boosted. Throughout each iteration, the solutions undergo various operations, including reflection, contraction, and expansion, to enhance the effectiveness of the algorithm. In this algorithm, produced solutions by the CSS are sorted and divided into two groups of good and bad solutions, and then the NM operators are applied to bad solutions to generate the possible best ones. The proposed algorithm is verified through some mathematical benchmark functions. Then, it is implemented on a real-size reinforced concrete bridge to reach an optimum design. To recognize the effective parameters in the design of structural components of reinforced concrete bridges, a sensitivity analysis is carried out. The total cost of materials in piers and the deck is defined as an objective function, and the cross-section area of structural elements and longitudinal reinforcements are chosen as design variables. The results of simulations represent the stability and robustness of the proposed NM-CSS method compared to standard CSS. In other words, utilizing the proposed NM-CSS algorithm in an optimum design of the piers and deck results in saving %3.685 and %2.084 of costs, respectively, in comparison with the results of the standard CSS.

TI FSDF: A high-performance fire detection framework
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Fire detection; Deep learning; YOLOv8; VQ-VAE
AB Fire detection is crucial in the protection of human life and property. Traditional methodologies and deep learning techniques have been extensively employed in this area, yet they often fall short due to the considerable variability in the shape, size, and intensity of flames. Conventional approaches lean on predefined fire characteristics, failing to adapt sufficiently across a broad spectrum of fire conditions. Simultaneously, deep learning techniques may struggle with managing diverse and unusual flame attributes. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that synergizes traditional methods with deep learning techniques-the Fire Segmentation-Detection Framework (FSDF). FSDF enhances flame feature detection by extracting color and texture information from images, utilizing Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV), and the Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP). In addition, we weave YOLOv8 and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) into the fabric of our framework to facilitate image segmentation and carry out unsupervised fire detection, respectively. To gauge the accuracy and robustness of our proposed method, we implemented a comprehensive assessment using a dataset constructed from real-world forest and urban fires. Experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the competitive edge of our approach over some baseline methods. For instance, in contrast to YOLOv8, our framework has bolstered precision, recall, and F-score by 19.5%, 1.2%, and 11.7% respectively. Finally, we conducted extensive field tests by deploying a robot with the relevant algorithm in an actual fire scenario, further emphasizing our dedication to real-world application. These experiments underline not only the performance of the method, but also its potential for practical deployment.

AB The phase of operation and maintenance (O&M) is the most time-consuming and cost-intensive stage in the project life cycle. However, the potential benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in this phase have not been fully explored, unlike in the design and construction phases. This is particularly evident in the absence of a comprehensive assessment of its application capabilities. In light of this setting, we develop a BIM maturity assessment model (BIM MAM) for the project's O&M phase. The proposed model comprises of an assessment indicator system that facilitates experts in providing individual assessment results, and a collective opinion aggregation method in a probabilistic context based on a multi-objective optimization model that is employed to generate the ultimate collective assessment results. The established multi-objective optimization model for BIM MAM incorporates the influence of human behavior factors on the final results by introducing the fairness concern utility level as an objective. Finally, we take Wuhan Jiangxia Sewage Treatment Plant as a practical case to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed BIM MAM.

AB Feature selection, also known as attribute reduction, plays a crucial role in machine learning and data mining tasks. Rough set theory-based feature selection methods have gained popularity due to their ability to handle imprecise and inconsistent data, ease of implementation, and generation of highly interpretable results. However, these methods still suffer from high computational cost when dealing with large-scale datasets with high dimensions. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a fast attribute reduction method based on inconsistent equivalence classes. The presented method can accelerate those attribute reduction algorithms whose importance measures used can be computed using only inconsistent equivalence classes. Our proposed method improves attribute reduction efficiency through three key aspects: 1) transforming the original dataset into an equivalently simplified version with fewer samples, 2) accelerating the computation of core attributes, and 3) expediting the forward selection process by removing redundant objects and attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the high computational efficiency of our proposed method.

TI Creating synthetic datasets for collaborative filtering recommender

AB Research and education in machine learning requires diverse, representative, and open datasets that contain sufficient samples to handle the necessary training, validation, and testing tasks. Currently, the Recommender Systems area includes a large number of subfields in which accuracy and beyond-accuracy quality measures are continuously being improved. To feed this research variety, it is both necessary and convenient to reinforce the existing datasets with synthetic ones. This paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method to generate collaborative filtering datasets in a parameterized way by selecting their preferred number of users, items, samples, and stochastic variability. This parameterization cannot be performed using regular GANs. Our GAN model is fed with dense, short, and continuous embedding representations of items and users, instead of sparse, large, and discrete vectors, to ensure fast and accurate learning, as compared to the traditional approach based on large and sparse input vectors. The proposed architecture includes a DeepMF model to extract the dense user and item embeddings and a clustering process to convert the dense GAN generated samples to the discrete and sparse samples necessary to create each required synthetic dataset. The results from three different source datasets show adequate distributions and expected quality values and evolutions in the generated datasets compared to the source datasets. Synthetic datasets and source codes are available to researchers.

ID EMOTION RECOGNITION
AB Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has been widely used in affective computing. However, the study on improving recognition accuracy across individuals is insufficient. In this study, a new linear domain adaption approach with experiment-level batch normalization and a single-layer depthwise convolutional neural network is proposed. In particular, the experiment-level batch normalization and depthwise convolutional neural network can be integrated as a linear mapping with a scaling parameter and a translation parameter. By linear mapping, difference between subjects in different domain can be effectively diminished, and the mapping parameters can be used to further investigate EEG emotion mechanism. The domain adaption experiments are conducted with SJTU emotion EEG dataset and SJTU emotion EEG dataset-IV, which are divided into source domain and target domain to validate the recognition effect across individuals. Multiple traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers are used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By mapping the EEG data from source domain to target domain, the increment of recognition accuracy is up to 61.11% when using the support vector machine classifier. The highest recognition accuracy 97.22% is achieved when using the logistic regression classifier. The scaling and translation parameters in the mapping procedure are then analyzed with statistical methods. It is found that EEG signal waves in the same emotion category are highly similar and EEG data have characteristics including integration of channels and hierarchy of frequency bands. In addition, the experimental results indicate that emotion complexity and emotion sensitiveness of brain cortex regions can affect the correlations between channels.

ID ORIENTEERING PROBLEM; SALESMAN
AB The Traveling Backpacker Problem (TBP) has been recently proposed to address the growing use of air transportation for tourism. It aims to identify routes with the minimum air ticket costs of a predefined set of destinations. Nevertheless, this problem may not be as flexible as the backpacker's profile. Backpackers usually have a limited budget and wish to get good deals. To better address this type of traveler, this paper introduces priority-based variants for the TBP, where not necessarily all destinations are visited. For such, prizes are assigned to the places according to the user's preferences for the destinations. The first model here proposed is the Prize Collecting Traveling Backpacker Problem (PCTBP). It minimizes the air ticket costs plus the penalties for unvisited destinations. Besides, we introduce the Time-Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP), which maximizes the prizes associated with the destinations but limits the budget according to a predefined value. Computational experiments involved real data and prizes following different distributions. Efficient multi-start randomized heuristics were developed for the problems. The results indicated that, depending on how the user assigns the prizes, the pattern of the routes differs significantly.

DE Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Semantic augmented prompt tuning;
   Self-attention; Graph convolution
AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task. The model is influenced by irrelevant context and complex structure when modeling the relationship between aspect and sentiment expression. Existing studies mainly improve the performance of the ABSA task by fine-tuning the pre-trained language model(PLM) and extracting valid information(e.g., syntax and context). However, these approaches fail to exploit the performance of PLM and ignore the rich semantic knowledge contained in PLM. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Prompt Semantic Augmented Network (PSAN), which improves the performance of ABSA by fine-tuning the PLM and leveraging the semantic knowledge contained in the PLM. Specifically, we propose semantic augmented prompt tuning (SAPT), which obtains a more relevant representation of the task by constructing prompt templates for the input sentences. Meanwhile, we construct corresponding label templates for the prompt templates and use them as the labels of the prompt templates, by which the sentence information containing the real labels is introduced into the model as a prior knowledge. Meanwhile, we use self-attention and graph convolutional networks (GCN) to obtain contextual and syntactic information. And finally, we aggregate these three types of information to perform the ABSA task. Experiments show that our SAPT can improve the performance of the PLM compared to classical fine-tuning, resulting in better results. Our proposed SAPT can obtain richer prompt semantic information than prompt tuning. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

ID GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK; FRAMEWORK; CONSTRAINTS; TRANSFORM
AB Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is an image enhancement technology with broad application prospects that can effectively extend the depth-of-field of optical lenses. This paper presents a novel MFIF method, named FusionDiff, based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). FusionDiff uses DDPM to fuse two source images by iteratively performing multiple denoising operations. To predict noise accurately and train the model efficiently, a lightweight U-Net architecture is designed as the conditional noise predictor. FusionDiff does not depend on any specific activity level measurement method, fusion rule or complex feature extraction network. It overcomes many algorithm design and training difficulties in existing image fusion methods. FusionDiff is noise-resistant and can still produce outstanding fusion results from source images with noise interference. In addition, FusionDiff is a few-shot learning method, which makes it suitable for image fusion tasks where training samples are relatively scarce. Experiments show that FusionDiff outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods in both visual perception and quantitative metrics.

   filtering; Convolutional neural network (CNN)
AB Identifying the model of the camera used for image capture is very useful in image forensics. To exploit complementary camera model specific features, we propose a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for camera model identification (CMI), where one branch directly uses the three-channel RGB image and the other uses a noise image obtained via high-pass filtering. For scalability, the approach operates on cropped image patches and majority voting is used for image-level CMI. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets and compare its performance against prior approaches. For quantifying CMI accuracy, we use existing patch and image level (accuracy) metrics and also a new metric that we propose for assessing the robustness of image-level camera model estimates. Importantly, our evaluations and performance comparisons include: (a) datasets that are more representative of real-world application scenarios of current interest, where the images have undergone unknown processing as a result of sharing on social media platforms, and (b) cross-dataset scenarios where the evaluation is performed on a dataset different from and not necessarily represented by the training dataset. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers improvements over the prior techniques, with particularly significant gains in accuracy for the social media dataset and for cross-dataset robustness assessment. The significant improvements over prior approaches that have used a single RGB or noise branch support our hypothesis that the proposed dual-branch architecture provides a convenient mechanism to introduce a favorable inductive bias in CNN architectures for CMI.

AB Stochastic exploration is the key to the success of the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm. However, most existing stochastic exploration approaches either explore actions heuristically regardless of their Q values or couple the sampling with Q values, which inevitably introduce bias into the learning process. In this article, we propose a novel preference-guided epsilon-greedy exploration algorithm that can efficiently facilitate exploration for DQN without introducing additional bias. Specifically, we design a dual architecture consisting of two branches, one of which is a copy of DQN, namely, the Q branch. The other branch, which we call the preference branch, learns the action preference that the DQN implicitly follows. We theoretically prove that the policy improvement theorem holds for the preference-guided epsilon-greedy policy and experimentally show that the inferred action preference distribution aligns with the landscape of corresponding Q values. Intuitively, the preference-guided epsilon-greedy exploration motivates the DQN agent to take diverse actions, so that actions with larger Q values can be sampled more frequently, and those with smaller Q values still have a chance to be explored, thus encouraging the exploration. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method by benchmarking it with well-known DQN variants in nine different environments. Extensive results confirm the superiority of our proposed method in terms of performance and convergence speed.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), medical institutions are accumulating vast amounts of medical data and aiming to utilize this data to train high-quality deep-learning models for assisting doctors in diagnosis. However, due to the highly sensitive nature of medical data, data fusion has always been problematic. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention as it allows for model training without exposing raw data. Nevertheless, existing research demonstrates that FL still brings the risk of privacy breaches. Furthermore, within the FL framework, a malicious server could potentially provide forged aggregated results, leading to disastrous consequences for the medical system. In this paper, we propose the RFLPV, a robust FL scheme with privacy preservation and verifiable aggregation to enable collaboration among medical institutions and facilitate the fusion of medical data. Specifically, we preserve gradient privacy by adding pairwise masks. Additionally, we design an efficient verification mechanism to tackle the threat posed by a malicious server. Furthermore, we develop a customized local training strategy to accommodate the heterogeneity of medical data. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of RFLPV using a real medical dataset.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; NSGA-II
AB There are many fields involving multi-objective optimization problems in presence of dynamic and interval environments (DI-MOPs), in which the number of objective functions is greater than one, the objectives are conflicting with each other, the problem is varying with time, and the parameters are interval-valued. Conflicts between multiple objectives make interval problems more difficult to be optimized in the dynamic environment. Recent works suffer from the lack of accuracy in change severity detection, the lack of adaptability in change response, and insufficient consideration of reducing imprecision. To tackle these issues, a novel reinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed in this study, which has three original contributions: (1) Internal interval similarity is specially designed for the interval detection of change severity. To be specific, this operator is proposed for higher accuracy, including the hybridization between the interval similarity and point similarity, and the decision of the detection object and strategy. (2) Q learning is embedded into the optimization algorithm to select the optimal change response after the change occurs. The benefit of this operator is that the response mechanism is dynamically changed in accordance to the environments. (3) To reduce the uncertainty of problems, a new crowding distance operator is presented to guide the search to simultaneously increase diversity, speed up convergence, and decrease imprecision. The computational results from the benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other state-of-the-art algorithms, generating Pareto sets with stronger convergence, wider distribution, and less uncertainty.

ID ENSEMBLE
AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a well-known approach for training single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) in machine learning. However, ELM is most effective when used for regression on datasets with simple Gaussian distributed error because it often employs a squared loss in its objective function. In contrast, real-world data is often collected from unpredictable and diverse contexts, which may contain complex noise that cannot be characterized by a single distribution. To address this challenge, we propose a robust mixture ELM algorithm, called Mixture-ELM, that enhances modeling capability and resilience to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise. The Mixture-ELM algorithm uses an adjusted objective function that blends Gaussian and Laplacian distributions to approximate any continuous distribution and match the noise. The Gaussian mixture accurately models the residual distribution, while the inclusion of the Laplacian distribution addresses the limitations of the Gaussian distribution in identifying outliers. We derive a solution to the novel objective function using the expectation maximization (EM) and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm through numerical simulation and experiments on benchmark datasets, thereby demonstrating its superiority over other state-of-the-art machine learning methods in terms of robustness and generalization.

AB Mine safety is a crucial aspect of national infrastructure. In recent years, there have been frequent mine safety accidents in China, and the proportion of mine water-inrush accidents (MWAs) is high among them. It causes significant challenges for governments and mine managers. The emergency response of MWAs is a multi-scale expert decision-making system that involves considerable cost, time, and energy consumption. The Mine Accidents Central Control Office is constituted of mine managers and government officials, and it lacks scientific validity in analyzing the risk correlation only based on sensory-historical experience. It can lead to deviations in emergency response capability and cause unnecessary waste of costs, time, and energy. This study introduces scenario construction theory and multi-attribute dynamic combination algorithms to address this systemic challenges based on the data-driven model. Firstly, the dataset is structured by the induction method based on historical MWAs from 2003 to 2023 in China, and it is divided into nine accident attributes and three calculated categories. Secondly, the scenario parameters are selected with bottom-line thinking and correlation analysis of accident attributes. Thirdly, the scenario queue model and scenario disposal model are constructed based on the scenario construction theory with the dynamic combination algorithm; a systemic mathematical model is established to optimize the multi-objective (cost, time, and energy consumption) in emergency response. Finally, a real metal mine is selected for model simulation, based on data results to analyze algorithm variable reflected handle measure. This study provides a novel approach and scientific reference to improve emergency plans in mine safety management. It enhances the effectiveness and timeliness of emergency response in the MWAs.

AB In recent years, class-imbalanced learning has become an important branch of machine learning. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is known as a benchmark method to address imbalanced learning. Although SMOTE performs well on many data, it also has the drawback of generating noisy samples. There are many SMOTE variants to solve this problem. Specifically, these methods are hybrid sampling methods, that is, carrying out an undersampling stage after SMOTE to remove noisy samples. It requires a method that can accurately identify noise to provide reliable performance. In this paper, a hybrid re-sampling method based on SMOTE and a two-layer nearest neighbor classifier (SMOTE-kTLNN) is proposed. SMOTE-kTLNN recognition noise is realized by an Iterative-Partitioning Filter (IPF). Specifically, SMOTE is performed on the original data to balance the data, then the data is divided into n equal parts, establishing kTLNN on each part to predict the whole data. And noisy samples are removed according to the majority voting rule. In the last, the balanced data sets are used to train kNN, AdaBoost, and SVM to verify whether SMOTE-kTLNN is irrelevant to the classifier. The experiment results demonstrate that SMOTE-kTLNN performs better than the comparisons in 25 binary data sets, including Recall, AUC, F1-measure, and G-mean.

ID RECOGNITION; REGRESSION; MACHINE
AB Broad learning system (BLS) is a novel neural network with efficient learning and expansion capacity, but it is sensitive to noise. Accordingly, the existing robust broad models try to suppress noise by assigning each sample an appropriate scalar weight to tune down the contribution of noisy samples in network training. However, they disregard the useful information of the noncorrupted elements hidden in the noisy samples, leading to unsatisfactory performance. To this end, a novel BLS with adaptive reweighting (BLS-AR) strategy is proposed in this article for the classification of data with label noise. Different from the previous works, the BLS-AR learns for each sample a weight vector rather than a scalar weight to indicate the noise degree of each element in the sample, which extends the reweighting strategy from sample level to element level. This enables the proposed network to precisely identify noisy elements and thus highlight the contribution of informative ones to train a more accurate representation model. Thanks to the separability of the model, the proposed network can be divided into several subnetworks, each of which can be trained efficiently. In addition, three corresponding incremental learning algorithms of the BLS-AR are developed for adding new samples or expanding the network. Substantial experiments are conducted to explicate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed BLS-AR model.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have made remarkable achievements in various fields, but they are vulnerable to changes in environment dynamics. This vulnerability easily leads to poor generalization, low performance, and catastrophic failures in unseen environments, which severely hinders the application of DRL in real-world scenarios. The robustness via adversary populations (RAP) algorithm addresses this issue by introducing a population of adversaries that perturb the protagonist. However, the low data utilization efficiency and lack of population diversity greatly limit the generalization performance. This article proposes robust adversary populations with volume diversity measure (RAP Vol) to address these drawbacks. In the proposed joint adversarial training framework, we use the training data to update all adversaries rather than only a single adversary, leading to a higher data utilization efficiency and a fast convergence speed. In the proposed population diversity iterative improvement mechanism, the vectors representing adversaries span a high-dimensional region. The volume of this region is utilized to measure and enhance population diversity via its square. The ablation experiments have verified the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving the robustness against variations in environment dynamics. Also, the influence of various factors (such as adversary population size and diversity weight) on the robustness has been investigated.

AB Recent research shows that the sole accuracy metric may lead to the homogeneous and repetitive recommendations for users and affect the long-term user engagement. Multiobjective reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method to achieve a good balance in multiple objectives, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. However, it has two deficiencies: neglecting the updating of negative action Q values and limited regulation from the RL Q-networks to the (self-)supervised learning recommendation network. To address these disadvantages, we develop the supervised multiobjective negative actor-critic (SMONAC) algorithm, which includes a negative action update mechanism and multiobjective actor-critic mechanism. For the negative action update mechanism, several negative actions are randomly sampled during each time updating, and then, the offline RL approach is utilized to learn their Q values. For the multiobjective actor-critic mechanism, accuracy, diversity, and novelty Q values are integrated into the scalarized Q value, which is used to criticize the supervised learning recommendation network. The comparative experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the developed SMONAC achieves tremendous performance promotion, especially for the metrics of diversity and novelty.

AB Inspired by the life philosophy, an ingenious gate (membership) function, which can mimic the open and close of the gate in the real world, is proposed to realize feature selection (FS) for interval type-2 fuzzy neural network. Based on the widths of gate functions, a smoothing integrated learning strategy is designed, and in the regularized FS error function the gate widths corresponding to one feature are grouped as one Group Lasso (GL) regularization term. During the training procedure of feature selection, all the group terms with respect to bad features will be punished, but for the good features the corresponding group terms converge to different nonzero values. When feature selection is finished, using the selected features, the interpretable clustering algorithm based initial interval type-2 rule generation method is detailedly introduced firstly, then a simple and efficient memory-based gradient method is presented for the tuning of rule structure parameters. Lastly, employing the simulation results of four regression problems and four classification problems, the effectiveness on simultaneous feature selection and system identification of our proposed model, i.e., the smoothing Group Lasso based interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (SGLIT2FNN), is proved, which illustrates that SGLIT2FNN not only simplifies the model structure by deleting the bad features, but also maintains the performance.

AB Calibrating appropriate trust of non-expert users in artificial intelligence (AI) systems is a challenging yet crucial task. To align subjective levels of trust with the objective trustworthiness of a system, users need information about its strengths and weaknesses. The specific explanations that help individuals avoid over- or under-trust may vary depending on their initial perceptions of the system. In an online study, 127 participants watched a video of a financial AI assistant with varying degrees of decision agency. They generated 358 spontaneous text descriptions of the system and completed standard questionnaires from the Trust in Automation and Technology Acceptance literature (including perceived system competence, understandability, human-likeness, uncanniness, intention of developers, intention to use, and trust). Comparisons between a high trust and a low trust user group revealed significant differences in both open-ended and closed-ended answers. While high trust users characterized the AI assistant as more useful, competent, understandable, and humanlike, low trust users highlighted the system's uncanniness and potential dangers. Manipulating the AI assistant's agency had no influence on trust or intention to use. These findings are relevant for effective communication about AI and trust calibration of users who differ in their initial levels of trust.

AB The conditional long text generation is an important yet challenging task especially for some domain-specific applications such as financial report generation. Generally, this emerging financial report generation is to generate long and informative text provided by a piece of short news, where the domain knowledge obviously plays an important role. Apparently, such domain knowledge dynamically varies but could be learned from reports written by human specialists to address multiple viewpoints contained in the original news. To address this issue, this article proposes the mutual information guided financial report generation approach with domain adaption. Particularly, we first extract the underlying domain spaces from the input news as well as their corresponding reports, respectively. Then, these domains are aligned with each other in a mutual manner via the proposed domain adaption component. To further enhance the model performance, the mutual information loss is designed to guarantee the semantic meaning of the generated report is close to that of the input news. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets and the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art model performance.

ID PLAN RECOGNITION; ASSISTANCE
AB Goal recognisers attempt to infer an agent's intentions from a sequence of observed actions. This is an important component of intelligent systems that aim to assist or thwart actors; however, there are many challenges to overcome. For example, the initial state of the environment could be partially unknown, and agents can act suboptimally and observations could be missing. Approaches that adapt classical planning techniques to goal recognition have previously been proposed, but, generally, they assume the initial world state is accurately defined. In this paper, a state is inaccurate if any fluent's value is unknown or incorrect. Our aim is to develop a goal recognition approach that is as accurate as the current state-of-the-art algorithms and whose accuracy does not deteriorate when the initial state is inaccurately defined. To cope with this complication, we propose solving goal recognition problems by means of an Action Graph. An Action Graph models the dependencies, i.e. order constraints, between all actions rather than just actions within a plan. Leaf nodes correspond to actions and are connected to their dependencies via operator nodes. After generating an Action Graph, the graph's nodes are labelled with their distance from each hypothesis goal. This distance is based on the number and type of nodes traversed to reach the node in question from an action node that results in the goal state being reached. For each observation, the goal probabilities are then updated based on either the distance the observed action's node is from each goal or the change in distance. Our experimental results, for 15 different domains, demonstrate that our approach is robust to inaccuracies within the defined initial state.

AB Logs are a reliable source of information for development and maintenance purposes. They record information at runtime regarding the state of a system and are commonly used to analyze its behavior. Parsing operations on logs structure the information embedded within the log message and are a crucial step for many log mining applications. In such use cases, parsing effectiveness can impact performance. For systems that require real-time performance, parsing efficiency is also an important factor. In this paper, we present USTEP, an online log parser that uses an evolving tree structure to encode and discover new parsing rules on the fly. Our evaluation of 14 datasets from different logging environments highlights the superiority of our method in terms of robustness and effectiveness compared to the state of the art. Our analysis of space and time complexity shows that USTEP is the only considered method capable of processing logs in constant time regardless of their length. We also propose here USTEP-UP, a way of running multiple USTEP instances in parallel.

AB This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called center of gravity (CoG). The main idea of CoG is attributing the potential function to a set of particles in problem space and finding the contour lines. With each particle moving with a predefined location in search space, the potential function is defined based on particle's fitness values. The particles are then ranked according to their finesses. Through clustering of particles, the contour line will be constructed which then leads to determining their center of gravity. This process will iteratively continue by updating the particles in each iteration and ultimately achieving the global CoG. The proposed CoG algorithm is shown to be useful for different types of uni-modal to multi-modal benchmark functions. Also, optimizing some important engineering problems has been considered. The performance of this new optimization algorithm has been compared with some of the optimization algorithms. Simulation results confirm that the CoG algorithm provides performance improvement compared to other existing methods in various scenarios.

ID COMMUNITY DETECTION; NETWORK
AB Attributed graph clustering, the task of grouping nodes into communities using both graph structure and node attributes, is a fundamental problem in graph analysis. Recent approaches have utilized deep learning for node embedding followed by conventional clustering methods. However, these methods often suffer from the limitations of relying on the original network structure, which may be inadequate for clustering due to sparsity and noise, and using separate approaches that yield suboptimal embeddings for clustering. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Deep Attributed Clustering with High-order Proximity Preserve (DAC-HPP) for attributed graph clustering. DAC-HPP leverages an end-to-end deep clustering framework that integrates high-order proximities and fosters structural cohesiveness and attribute homogeneity. We introduce a modified Random Walk with Restart that captures k-order structural and attribute information, enabling the modelling of interactions between network structure and high-order proximities. A consensus matrix representation is constructed by combining diverse proximity measures, and a deep joint clustering approach is employed to leverage the complementary strengths of embedding and clustering. In summary, DAC-HPP offers a unique solution for attributed graph clustering by incorporating high-order proximities and employing an end-to-end deep clustering framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, showcasing its superiority over existing methods. Evaluation on synthetic and real networks demonstrates that DAC-HPP outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its potential for advancing attributed graph clustering research.

DE Trajectory-user linking; Spatial-temporal trajectory; Mobility signature
AB Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to link trajectories to users who generate them, based on the historical trajectories of a set of users (e.g., social media users or drivers). It is a fundamental task for many downstream applications of trajectory data. However, there is a lack of a general method to solve the TUL problem for different types of trajectory data. Existing studies usually focus on specific trajectory data, such as check-in data. Unlike subjectively self-selected check-in data, objectively recorded trajectory data is more prevalent and voluminous in real life. To address the issue, we propose a mobility signature augmentation model named SAMLink to solve the TUL problem for different types of trajectory data. It contains three components: feature embedding, mobility signature learning, and linking. Specifically, there are three modules in the key component of mobility signature learning, i.e., local mobility signature learning, attention-based signature augmentation, and adaptive fusion. The first module encodes the input trajectory to learn the local mobility signature, while the second module generates a global mobility signature from the historical trajectories using an attention mechanism. Furthermore, the last module adaptively fuses local and global mobility signatures to yield better identification results. We evaluate our proposed model on three real-world trajectory datasets, i.e., the check-in dataset, the TCD dataset, and the ERI taxi dataset. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed model for solving the TUL problem across different types of trajectory data.

AB Mental stress is a significant risk factor for several maladies and can negatively impact a person's quality of life, including their work and personal relationships. Traditional methods of detecting mental stress through interviews and questionnaires may not capture individuals' instantaneous emotional responses. In this study, the method of experience sampling was used to analyze the participants' immediate affective responses, which provides a more comprehensive and dynamic understanding of the participants' experiences. WorkStress3D dataset was compiled using information gathered from 20 participants for three distinct modalities. During an average of one week, 175 h of data containing physiological signals such as BVP, EDA, and body temperature, as well as facial expressions and auditory data, were collected from a single subject. We present a novel fusion model that uses double-early fusion approaches to combine data from multiple modalities. The model's F1 score of 0.94 with a loss of 0.18 is very encouraging, showing that it can accurately identify and classify varying degrees of stress. Furthermore, we investigate the utilization of transfer learning techniques to improve the efficacy of our stress detection system. Despite our efforts, we were unable to attain better results than the fusion model. Transfer learning resulted in an accuracy of 0.93 and a loss of 0.17, illustrating the difficulty of adapting pre-trained models to the task of stress analysis. The results we obtained emphasize the significance of multi-modal fusion in stress detection and the importance of selecting the most suitable model architecture for the given task. The proposed fusion model demonstrates its potential for achieving an accurate and robust classification of stress. This research contributes to the field of stress analysis and contributes to the development of effective models for stress detection.

AB Conventionally, fine-tuning or transfer learning using a pre-trained convolutional network is adopted to design a classifier. However, when the dataset is small this can deteriorate the classifier generalization performance due to negative transfer or overfitting issues. In this paper, we suggest a flexible and high-capacity multiple kernel-based convolutional neural network (MK-CNN) to automate the pathological brain classification task. The proposed network employed different stacks of convolution with various kernels to obtain multi-scale features from the input image. The smaller kernel size provides specific information about the local features whereas the larger kernel size provides the global spatial information. Hence, the network takes into account both regional specifics and global spatial consistency thanks to this multi-scale methodology. Only the output layer is shared between each network stack. This makes it possible to specifically tweak the CNN's weights and biases for each convolution stack and associated kernel size. The results reported on real patient data from the Harvard Whole Brain Atlas reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. The suggested approach may be used to help experts carry out the clinical follow-up study.

DT Article; Early Access
DE RGBT tracking; Motion blur; Multi-frequency; Cross-scale; Soft threshold
AB RGBT tracking combines visible and thermal infrared images to achieve tracking and faces challenges due to motion blur caused by camera and target movement. In this study, we observe that the tracking in motion blur is significantly affected by both frequency and spatial aspects. And blurred targets exhibit sharp texture details that are represented as high-frequency information. But existing trackers capture low-frequency components while ignoring high-frequency information. To enhance the representation of sharp information in blurred scenes, we introduce multi-frequency and multi-spatial information in network, called FSBNet. First, we construct a modality-specific unsymmetrical architecture and integrate an adaptive soft threshold mechanism into a DCT-based multi-frequency channel attention adapter (DFDA). DFDA adaptively integrates rich multi-frequency information. Second, we propose a masked frequency-based translation adapter (MFTA) to refine drifting failure boxes caused by camera motion. Moreover, we find that small targets get more affected by motion blur compared to larger targets, and we mitigate this issue by designing a cross-scale mutual conversion adapter (CFCA) between the frequency and spatial domains. Extensive experiments on GTOT, RGBT234 and LasHeR benchmarks demonstrate the promising performance of our method in the presence of motion blur.

AB Railroad inspections to identify missing track components are crucial to railroad operational safety. This paper presents a new lightweight computer vision model on edge devices for accurate, real-time rail track inspection. It modifies the teacher-student guidance mechanism in NanoDet (https://github.com/RangiLyu/nanodet) by introducing a new adaptively weighted loss (AWL) to the training process. The AWL evaluates the teacher and student model qualities, determines the weight of the student loss, and then balances their loss contributions on-the-fly, gearing the training process toward proper knowledge distillation and guidance. Compared to SOTA models, our AWL-NanoDet features a tiny model size of less than 10 MB and a computation cost of 1.52 G FLOPs and achieves an processing time of less than 14 ms per frame when tested on Nvidia's AGX Orin. Relative to native NanoDet, it also notably improves the model's performance by nearly 10%, enabling highly accurate, real-time detection of track components.

SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Student modelling; Generative adversarial imitation learning;
   Intelligent tutoring systems
AB The continuous application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in online education has led to significant progress, especially in the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), online courses and learning management systems (LMS). An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students' learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students' learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students' behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model's prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario.

ID CONTEXT; MODEL
AB Scene structure recovery is a crucial process for assisting scene reconstruction and understanding by extracting vital scene structure information and has been widely used in smart city, VR/AR and intelligent robot navigation. Omnidirectional image with a 180 degrees or 360 degrees field of view (FoV) provides greater visual information, making them a significant research topic in computer vision and computational photography. However, indoor omnidirectional scene structure recovery faces challenges like severe occlusion of critical local regions caused by cluttered objects and large nonlinear distortion. To address these limitations, we propose a geometric-driven indoor structure recovery method based on planar depth map learning, aiming to mitigate the interference caused by occlusions in critical local regions. Our approach involves designing an OmniPDMNet, a planar depth map learning network for omnidirectional image, which uses upsampling and a feature-based objective loss function to accurately estimate high-precision planar depth map. Furthermore, we leverage prior knowledge from the omnidirectional depth map and introduce it into the structure recovery network (OmniSRNet) to extract global structural features and enhance the overall quality of structure recovery. We also introduce a distortion-aware module for feature extraction from omnidirectional image, allowing adaptability to omnidirectional geometric distortion and enhancing the performance of both OmniPDMNet and OmniSRNet. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on omnidirectional dataset focusing on planar depth and structure recovery demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

DE Anisotropic wireless sensor networks; Slime mold optimization algorithm;
   Chaotic mapping; Self adaptive adjustment
AB Considering the poor localization accuracy of anisotropic localization algorithms, an adaptive chaotic slime mold algorithm called TSMA is proposed to optimize node localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The adaptive chaos mechanism is first applied to the slime mold algorithm (SMA) to initialize the population using the tent map of the chaotic map with the goal of increasing the diversity of the population. Then, global and local search capabilities can be combined by setting an adaptive chaotic oscillation factor during the iterative algorithm optimization. A new localization algorithm combining PDM and TSMA is proposed in the anisotropic localization environment of WSNs. The localization performance of PDM-TSMA is further improved due to the use of anchor node screening and a feasible domain-limiting strategy. According to the simulation results, the proposed algorithm improves the localization performance by 28% and 46% on average in three different environments.

ID CAPACITANCE-RESISTANCE MODEL; PREDICTION; PROXY
AB In mature reservoirs, there are hundreds or thousands of producing and injecting wells operating simultaneously, so it is important to understand the impact of injection wells on producers to maintain pressure and control water production. In this work, we propose a workflow with two strategies, reduced-physics and data-driven modeling, to monitoring producer and injector wells based on interwell connectivity. The monitoring the wells allows to increase oil production, reducing water rate, and avoiding possible fracturing or fault reactivations. Both strategies use production history data only. The inputs in both strategies are injection rates, while output are liquid production rates. The first one, the reduced-physics modeling strategy, is based on the capacitance-resistance modeling for producers (CRMP), which calculates the liquid flowrate of the producing well based on the injection rate, productivity index of producers, time constant, and the connectivity between injectors and producers. The parameters of the CRMP model are obtained by minimizing the error between the observed and calculated liquid flowrates. The optimization algorithm that minimizes the error is the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and the gradient is obtained by finite differences. The second one, the data-driven modeling strategy is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which only use input and output data. The parameters of the artificial neural network, weights, and biases, are adjusted during the training process. Three architectures are proposed to match the outputs based on the inputs: single-layer perceptron, deep learning with multiple layers, and convolutional neural networks. The backpropagation algorithm is used to adjust the weights and biases of the architectures during training. In this study, we propose three alternatives for calculating the connectivities based on the trained model. The first one is based on the optimal weights. The second one is based on the average error after training and shuffling the input data, and the last one is based on the gradient importance. Two synthetic models, Two-phases, and Brush Canyon Outcrop, are used to validate the proposed workflow. The results show that the connectivities calculated by the gradient importance approach are closer to the connectivities obtained by the capacitance-resistance model. On the other hand, the connectivities obtained through the optimal weights and average error strategies show differences of 4% and 5%, respectively.

As a new intelligent algorithm that imitates the leadership function of wolves, the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) can solve NP problems more effectively than accurate algorithms. At the same time, the GWO has fewer parameters, faster calculations, and easier implementation than other intelligent algorithms. This paper introduces a method of adaptively updating the prey position of wolves and a differential evolution operator with a scaling factor that adaptively changes according to the number of iterations, and selects which operator to use for iteration by the value of the search agent parameter. Finally, it combines the improved greedy repair operator based on D {0-1} KP to form the adaptive grey wolf optimization with differential evolution operator (de-AGWO). The experimental results of the standard test function prove that the algorithm in this paper has a significant improvement in function optimization performance. And the experimental results of D {0-1} KP shows that the proposed algorithm yields superior solution outcomes, except for unrelated datasets, and exhibits significant advantages when solving strongly correlated datasets. Finally, it is verified that more than 80% of the iterations utilize the grey wolf evolution operator, highlighting that the core of the algorithm remains the GWO.

AB Assessing the quality of actions in videos is a challenging vision task, as the relationship between videos and action scores can be difficult to model. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted on action quality assessment (AQA) in the literature. Traditional AQA methods treat the problem as a regression task to learn the underlying mappings between videos and action scores. However, previous approaches overlook the presence of data uncertainty in AQA datasets. To address aleatoric uncertainty, we have developed a plug-and-play module called distribution auto-encoder (DAE). DAE encodes videos into distributions and utilizes the reparameterization trick to sample scores, which enables a more accurate mapping between videos and scores. Additionally, we use a likelihood loss to learn the uncertainty parameters. We have evaluated our approach on publicly available datasets, and extensive experiments demonstrate that DAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with the Spearman's correlation metric of 82.58%, 92.32%, and 76.00% on the AQA-7, MTL-AQA, and JIGSAWSS datasets, respectively. Furthermore, plug-and-play experiments also demonstrate the extensibility of DAE. Our code is available at https://github.com/InfoX-SEU/DAE-AQA.

AB In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards, online shopping has become an indispensable part of people's lives. The rapid development of e-commerce has brought unprecedented opportunities to the express delivery industry. Therefore, modern manufacturing enterprises must shorten the cycle from order to delivery to be successful. The study of machine learning (ML), which integrates computer science, statistics, pattern recognition, data mining, and predictive analytics, has become one of the most significant areas of research in the last few decades. It has also established itself as a cornerstone in terms of applications, making significant progress in modern information technology and practice. This paper used the capabilities of one of the powerful paradigms of ML called reinforcement learning (RL) and soft computing to improve the warehouse automation process while taking market demands into account. Since stackers and Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) are the main participants in this automation process, we focused on these two in our research to enhance the warehouse logistic scheduling process as a whole. To accomplish this, we collected historical data related to warehouse operation from the warehouse environment, such as AGV and stacker moments, inventory level, job execution time, and other pertinent factors. We first created an RF-based model using the Q-learning technique, one of the RF approaches, before using these data for the model training. The model designing is accomplished by first formulating the logistic scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the warehouse system changes between states and takes actions to maximize a cumulative reward over time. After that, we performed a number of operations, including state representation, action space definition, and reward design, to transform the problem into a format that the Q-learning approach can handle. In four experiments, the design model is trained using the data that has been collected up to 100 episodes. The proposed model is further improved with soft computing approaches such as fuzzy control methods. We utilized MATLAB and Plant simulation software to conduct the experiments. The results of the proposed model are thoroughly evaluated and compared with already existing approaches.

AB Autonomous vehicles require accurate, and fast decision-making perception systems to know the driving environment. The 2D object detection is critical in allowing the perception system to know the environment. However, 2D object detection lacks depth information, which are crucial for understanding the driving environment. Therefore, 3D object detection is essential for the perception system of autonomous vehicles to predict the location of objects and understand the driving environment. The 3D object detection also faces challenges because of scale changes, and occlusions. Therefore in this study, a novel object detection method is presented that fuses the complementary information of 2D and 3D object detection to accurately detect objects in autonomous vehicles. Firstly, the aim is to project the 3D-LiDAR data into image space. Secondly, the regional proposal network (RPN) to produce a region of interest (ROI) is utilised. The ROI pooling network is used to map the ROI into ResNet50 feature extractor to get a feature map of fixed size. To accurately predict the dimensions of all the objects, we fuse the features of the 3D-LiDAR with the regional features obtained from camera images. The fused features from 3D-LiDAR and camera images are employed as input to the faster-region based convolution neural network (Faster-RCNN) network for the detection of objects. The assessment results on the KITTI object detection dataset reveal that the method can accurately predict car, van, truck, pedestrian and cyclist with an average precision of 94.59%, 82.50%, 79.60%, 85.31%, 86.33%, respectively, which is better than most of the previous methods. Moreover, the average processing time of the proposed method is only 70 ms which meets the real-time demand of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the proposed model runs at 15.8 frames per second (FPS), which is faster than state-of-the-art fusion methods for 3D-LiDAR and camera.

AB Recently, digital images are widely used in several applications through advanced wearable devices and networks. Despite several benefits of digital images, such as easy distribution, storage, and reproduction, it is difficult to prevent the issue of identity theft, privacy leakage, and ownership conflicts. To solve the above issues, dimensionality reduction-based robust watermarking for color images, supported with suitable encryption, is presented in this article. In this method, principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction is applied to the color carrier image to produce three principal components. The third component with minimum energy is then concealed with a mark image using non-sub-sampled shearlet transform (NSST)-singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking to resolve the ownership issues, if any. In addition, encryption of marked image is done to provide better security and authenticity. The final encrypted image is then stored in a cloud environment for better accessibility. Finally, an experimental and comparative evaluation of the proposed framework justifies its versatility, robustness, and imperceptibility with the best improvement of 47.49 %.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Segmentation of microscopic images is always considered a challenging task due to the inherent properties of the microscopic images. In general, microscopic images have ambiguous region overlaps, small regions of interest, and weak correlation among the pixels and make the segmentation task difficult. Segmentation is useful in the identification of different regions of the microscopic images. In this work, a novel method is proposed which is based on the cuckoo search method. The cuckoo search method is modified using McCulloch's approach which is used in place of the Levy flight and, the Luus-Jaakola heuristic is used to perform a local search in a balanced manner, to enhance the exploring capability. Three objective functions, namely Otsu's interclass variance, Kapur's entropy, and Tsallis entropy, are used to obtain the optimal threshold values. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on the microscopic images of the basal cell of prostate epithelium from the repository of the Center for Research in biological systems. The proposed method is evaluated using four well-known validation parameters peak signal-to-noise ratio, mean square error, Intersection over Union, and feature similarity index. Moreover, the execution time of the CPU is also compared for each method, and different numbers of clusters are used for the evaluation purpose. It has been found that the proposed method generates some promising results and can precisely identify the objects in the microscopic images.

AB Formerly, coffee practitioners only needed to learn the requisite coffee brewing skills. Today, they must also be able to identify the quality of coffee beans, select the appropriate roasting method, and explain to customers the country of origin and production process for each variety of coffee they sell. Therefore, professional competency and competency development has become ever more critical for the coffee service industry. Therefore, this study used expert interviews and literature reviews to explore the professional competency and working attitude of practitioners in the coffee service industry and explored the significant aspects/criteria of competency development. The study adopted the IAA (importance-attention analysis) technique to evaluate the status of competency development aspects/criteria, and determined the NRM (network relation map) based on the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) technique. The results reveal that IC (implicit capability) and the EA (explicit attitude) are the primary influencers for the coffee industry's competency development. The study also proposed the adoption paths of competency development using the NRM (network relation map) approach. This study makes several recommendations for enhancing the professional competency and working attitude for coffee practitioners and provides some strategies for improving competency development and sustainable talent cultivation.

AB The study examines the POS tagger's precise usage of words that are used by Tamil lyricists in their poems. Many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and voice recognition, consider POS tagging to be a preparatory step. The POS labels for Tamil words have been determined through several investigations. The research does not look at the precision of the POS tagger for unrecognized keywords or words that do not occur in the lexicon. The practice of categorizing each word in a phrase according to its grammatical function is known as POS tagging. Since the NLP software will come across terms that are not in its lexicon in real-world applications, the presence of unfamiliar words is a common problem in POS tagging. Tamil's agglutinative structure makes language challenging for computers to understand. In-depth research on Tamil phrases has highlighted the need for more research on Dravidian languages, as well as the process of annotating syntactic categories aimed at apiece word in the corpus, and Tamil POS tagger is generating an annotated corpus for Tamil lyricist lyrics. The Friedman Two-way Analysis of Variance was employed by the writers to learn more about the lyricist's use of grammar in this context. Linear regression is a data analysis approach that establishes a causal association amid variables by fit a linear model toward the data. The investigation's findings demonstrated how greatly the lyricists' linguistic decisions varied.

AB Workflow recognition relying on deep convolutional neural network has obtained promising performance. Though impressive results have been achieved on standard industrial workflow, the performance on heavily occluded workflow remains far from satisfactory. In this paper, we present an effective context-aware compositional ConvNet (CA-CompNet) for occluded workflow detection with the following contributions. First, we combine compositional model and original ConvNet together to build a unified deep architecture for occluded workflow detection, which has shown innate robustness to address the problem of object classification under occlusion. Second, in order to overcome the variable occlusion limitations, the bounding box annotations are utilized to segment the context from target workflow instance during training. Then, these segmentations are used to learn the proposed CA-CompNet, which enables the network to untangle the feature representation of workflow instance from the context. Third, a robust voting mechanism for candidate bounding box is introduced to improve the detection accuracy, which facilitates the model to precisely detect the bounding box of a specific workflow instance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed context-aware network can robustly detect workflow instance under occlusion in industrial environment, increasing the detection performance on MS COCO dataset by 4.6% (from 45.1 to 49.7%) in absolute performance compared to the advanced CenterNet.

This use of modelling techniques within optimisation, while offers a practical reduction in function calls, brings along with it some additional questions. This paper starts with a description of the key elements of surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimisation algorithms as they are outlined throughout the literature, and then, proceeds to rearrange these elements using a novel blueprint of the field. The proposed blueprint can be used to represent any surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm in a way that illustrates its principles and components in a non-vague manner. In addition, a survey of the most prominent works in the field is conducted using this novel blueprint. Finally, a number of challenges and perspectives are listed before the paper is concluded.

AB Addressing complex optimization problems demands innovative solutions capable of navigating the interdependencies among variables, a reality often oversimplified by traditional metaheuristics. To address this challenge, this paper presents an enhanced African Vultures Optimization Algorithm, termed ci-AVOA, that incorporates the Choquet Integral, a powerful operator adept at considering criteria significance and interconnectedness in optimization scenarios. Unlike its predecessor, the ci-AVOA treats optimization problems in their true complexity by recognizing and accounting for the relationships between variables. The performance of ci-AVOA is evaluated on ten CEC2020 benchmark functions and four engineering design problems, pitted against other renowned optimization algorithms and the original AVOA. Across low and high dimensional benchmark functions, ci-AVOA consistently outperforms its counterparts, underpinning its superiority. This superior performance is further validated using non-parametric statistical tests, solidifying ci-AVOA as an effective and robust tool for tackling complex optimization problems. In essence, this study provides a significant contribution by augmenting a well-known metaheuristic with the Choquet Integral to devise a superior algorithm, ci-AVOA. This innovation extends the problem-solving capabilities of metaheuristics, promising more accurate and robust solutions for complex, real-world optimization problems.

DE Face deblurring; Laplace depth-wise separable convolution; Facial
   adaptive denormalization; Enhanced texture information
AB Image deblurring is an essential problem in computer vision. Due to highly structured and special facial components (e.g. eyes), most general image deblurring methods and face deblurring methods failed to yield more explicit structure and facial details, resulting in too smooth, uncoordinated and distorted face structure. Considering the unique face texture and sufficient facial details, we present an effective face deblurring network by exploiting more regularized structure and enhanced texture information (RSETNet). We first incorporate the face parsing network with fine-tuning to obtain more accurate face structure, and we present the feature adaptive denormalization (FAD) to regularize the facial structure as a condition of auxiliary to generate more harmonious and undistorted face structure. Meanwhile, to improve the generated facial texture information, we propose a new Laplace depth-wise separable convolution (LDConv) and multi-patch discriminator. Compared with existing methods, our face deblurring method could restore face structure more accurately and with more facial details. Experiments on two public face datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative indicators.

AB This article investigates the observer-based security control of discrete-time Markov jump systems (MJSs) subject to hybrid cyber-attacks and unmeasured states via event-triggered scheme. The event-triggered scheme (ETS) is being developed to relieve more network burdens. A Luenburger observer is used to estimate the unmeasured states. In this work, the hybrid cyber attack is addressed, which contains deception attacks and DoS attacks. It is anticipated that input control signals sent across a network are vulnerable to hybrid cyber-attacks in which adversaries could inject fake data into the control signals. Since system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is built to stabilize the system and keep the right performance index even when hybrid cyber-attacks happen. By solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the controllers and observers are also obtained. Lastly, inverted pendulum applications are shown to show how well and realistically the theoretical results can be used to respond to and get rid of the effects of hybrid cyber-attacks.

DE The Memory-triggered decision-making network; Temporal knowledge graph
   reasoning; Extrapolation; Dissolution constraint
AB The task of inferring missing facts using the temporal knowledge graph (TKG) is important and has been widely studied. Extrapolation in TKG inference is more challenging because no direct historical facts are available for predicting future events. Previous methods apply recursive embedding learning to solve the extrapolation problem. However, these methods primarily focus on recent historical facts and overlook the potential knowledge hidden in earlier facts. Moreover, the recursive embedding learning process can lead to imprecise knowledge propagation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-triggered decision-making (MTDM) network. It takes advantage of earlier historical facts to establish initial node representations and then updates node representations with recent historical facts. In particular, to enhance the prediction performance and efficiency, we update node representations of each timestamp in parallel using the proposed Res-GCN and then establish temporal correlations among these representations based on the designed control gating unit. To mitigate the issue of imprecise knowledge propagation, we leverage the facts most relevant to the missing knowledge to directly make predictions. This strategy improves the predictions by focusing on the most informative and contextual-free information. Additionally, we introduce the dissolution constraint, which enables us to analyse the process of event dissolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTDM outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB This work endeavored to develop a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneous quantification of three important biotherapeutic molecules namely, L-tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin, present in low amounts in agro-commodities. In the first approach, using pure chemical standards of the same in a mixture, chromatogram separation parameters such as peak sharpness, peak shouldering, and peak separation were judged by a human panel and biasness-cum-decision uncertainties were averted using fuzzy logic analysis. In the second approach, the separation parameters such as peak resolution and separation factors were evaluated to obtain a well-resolved chromatogram. The parameters of the said separation process were successfully modeled by dimensionless numbers of mass transfer of the analytes in the column; and post-fitting of mass transfer equations, high R2 was obtained suggesting successful development of the chromatographic process. Euclidean distances between the values of each chromatographic separation parameter and their respective ideal values; the defuzzified scores; findings of mass transfer study; and separation factors concomitantly established that the mobile phase of composition 1% acetic acid in HPLC water (A)-HPLC grade methanol (B) in gradient elution conditions (90% A-10% B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min could simultaneously quantify the three molecules (& mu;g) in button mushrooms with good resolution. The presence of the said biomolecules in the extract of button mushrooms was also confirmed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometer (MS). An artificial neural network model (high R2) was also developed for chromatographic users, which would allow accurate prediction of the chromatographic parameters by varying mobile phase composition and flow rates.
   This work endeavored to develop a high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous quantification of three important biotherapeutic molecules, namely, L-tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin, present in low amounts in agro-commodities. The findings of defuzzified scores, mass transfer studies, peak separation parameters, and Euclidean distances corroborated well; thus, it could be unambiguously concluded that the best resolved chromatographic separation method for simultaneous quantification of SER, TRYP, and MEL when present as a mixture of pure chemicals and also in agro-cum-food matrices, occurred with mobile phase of composition 1% acetic acid in HPLC water (A)-HPLC grade methanol (B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min under gradient elution conditions (90% A-10% B). The chromatographic separation method developed in this work can be easily deployed to chromatographic users for large-scale sample analysis of a myriad of biological matrices housing the said biomolecules. The ANN predictive model was a good fit owing to its high R2 (0.99) value, implying the developed method to be robust and reliable.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for self-driving vehicles, social robots, and intelligent monitoring applications. Diverse trajectory data is critical for high-accuracy trajectory prediction. However, the trajectory data is captured in scattered scenes, which can cause the problem of data island. Furthermore, artificial aggregation of trajectory data suffers from the risk of data leakage, ignoring the rule of privacy protection. We propose a multi-scene federated trajectory prediction (Fed-TP) method to solve the above problems. As our key contribution, a destination-oriented LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)-based trajectory prediction (DO-TP) network is proposed in each scene to forecast future trajectories in an encoder-decoder manner. The independent training using trajectory data in each scene can prevent data leakage and achieves high privacy security. As another key contribution, a federated learning framework is introduced to break the scene limitation by conducting distributed collaborative training. The performance of different federated learning methods is compared on public datasets, including ETH, UCY, and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). Compared with FedAvg and FedProx, FedAtt is more suitable for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better data privacy security than directly training on multiple scenes and superior prediction performance than training on a single scene.

AB In the wild, gliding birds dodge obstacles or predators by folding and twisting their wings swiftly to perform a rapid roll. Accordingly, the authors strive to explore the feasibility of improving the roll rate of drones through this bird-inspired morphing method, by using the asymmetric sweepback of wings to simulate the contraction of birds' wings and the deflection of the aileron to imitate wing torsion. Moreover, the effects of wing morphing on the centroid, inertia matrix, and aerodynamic characteristics of the drone are explored herein, and a nonlinear dynamic model is established. Furthermore, a novel cooperative strategy that combines wing morphing with aileron deflection for roll control is introduced, and a flight controller based on this cooperative strategy is developed. Finally, the superiority of the cooperative strategy and the accuracy of the dynamic modeling have been validated in the outdoor flights of the morphing wing drone.
   Herein, an innovative collaborative strategy of wing deformation and aileron deflection is proposed. Flight tests prove that the cooperative control can make the drone roll almost 2 times faster than aileron control at 4 & DEG; angle of attack. A closed-loop control system is established based on this collaborative strategy, which enables the improvement of roll control margin.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Three-way decision is about thinking, problem-solving, and computing in threes or through triads. Its philosophy and practice of triadic thinking appear everywhere. In particular, there are a number of three-world or triworld models in different fields and disciplines, where a complex system, a complicated issue, or an intricate concept is explained and understood in terms of three interrelated worlds, with each world enclosing a group of elements or representing a particular view. This paper examines various triadic metaphors and structures in general and three-world metaphors and conceptions in particular for building and explaining basic concepts of three-way decision. The three major objectives are (a) to formulate a TAO (Triading-Acting-Optimizing) framework of three-way decision, (b) to discuss the Dao, the Way of three-way decision, and (c) to articulate the Dao, the Way of three-world thinking. Three-world conceptions offer more insights into three-way decision with new viewpoints, methods, and modes. An emphasis of the paper is on the philosophy and the power of three-way decision for building high-level conceptual models. By using three-part structures, by focusing on only three things, or by considering three basic ingredients, we may build a theory, a model, or a method that is simple-tounderstand, easy-to-remember, and practical-to-use.

AB Image dehazing can improve image clarity and visual effect, which plays a pivotal role in many computer vision tasks. Existing dehazing methods are mostly based on a single feature stream and tend to ignore the lowfrequency characteristics of haze. In this paper, we propose a dual stream network for image dehazing. To enhance the edge information and texture detail of the image, we construct a frequency stream based on attention octave convolution. We decompose the features into high and low-frequency branches in the frequency stream to obtain different structural information. By adding a residual channel attention block, the attention octave convolution can extract frequency features more efficiently and effectively. Due to the lower resolution of low-frequency features in the frequency stream, the frequency stream features alone are insufficient for recovering the overall content of the image. Therefore, a content stream was added to compensate for the information lost in the frequency stream. By fusing the outputs of two feature streams, the network achieves an enhanced dehazing performance. The results show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms in quantitative evaluation and visual impact.

ID LOGIC
AB Conditional statements in natural language of the form "if A then B" have multiple interpretations that require different logical treatment. In this paper, we focus on probabilistic "if A then B" rules that are given either a Bayesian interpretation via conditional probabilities P(B | A), or couched as probabilistic material implication. While some have argued that Bayesian conditionals are the correct way to think about such rules, there are challenges with standard inferences such as modus ponens and modus tollens that might make probabilistic material implication a better candidate at times for rule-based systems employing forward-chaining; and arguably material implication is still suitable when information about prior or conditional probabilities is not available at all. We investigate a generalization of probabilistic material implication and Bayesian conditionals that combines the advantages of both formalisms in a systematic way and prove basic properties of the generalized implication, in particular, various bounds as well as properties of inference chains in graphs. And most importantly we provide a novel and natural interpretation of the generalized implication's main parameter. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The existence of real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs) (commonly in the form of patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous driving. This article presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the expectation over transformation (EOT) method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with SS models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios. Experimental results reveal that even though the adversarial effect is visible with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further questions about the spatial robustness of real-time SS models.

AB IntroductionRes-FLNet presents a cutting-edge solution for addressing autonomous driving tasks in the context of multimodal sensing robots while ensuring privacy protection through Federated Learning (FL). The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicles and robotics has escalated the need for efficient and safe navigation algorithms that also support Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration. However, the integration of data from diverse sensors like cameras, LiDARs, and radars raises concerns about privacy and data security.MethodsIn this paper, we introduce Res-FLNet, which harnesses the power of ResNet-50 and LSTM models to achieve robust and privacy-preserving autonomous driving. The ResNet-50 model effectively extracts features from visual input, while LSTM captures sequential dependencies in the multimodal data, enabling more sophisticated learning control algorithms. To tackle privacy issues, we employ Federated Learning, enabling model training to be conducted locally on individual robots without sharing raw data. By aggregating model updates from different robots, the central server learns from collective knowledge while preserving data privacy. Res-FLNet can also facilitate Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration as it allows robots to share knowledge while preserving privacy.Results and discussionOur experiments demonstrate the efficacy and privacy preservation of Res-FLNet across four widely-used autonomous driving datasets: KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset, ApolloScape, and BDD100K. Res-FLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and privacy preservation. Moreover, it exhibits promising adaptability and generalization across various autonomous driving scenarios, showcasing its potential for multi-modal sensing robots in complex and dynamic environments.

AB The present paper aims to propose a new method for neutralizing contradictions in neural networks. Neural networks exhibit numerous contradictions in the form of contrasts, differences, and errors, making it extremely challenging to find a compromise between them. In this context, neutralization is introduced not to resolve these contradictions, but to weaken them by transforming them into more manageable and concrete forms. In this paper, contradictions are neutralized or weakened through four neutralization methods: comprehensive, nullified, compressive, and collective. Comprehensive neutralization involves increasing the neutrality of all components in a neural network. Nullified neutralization is employed to weaken contradictions among different computational and optimization procedures. Compressive neutralization aims to simplify multi-layered neural networks while preserving the original internal information as much as possible. Collective neutralization is achieved by considering as many final networks as possible under different conditions, inputs, learning steps, and so on. The proposed method was applied to two data sets, one of which consisted of irregular forms resulting from natural language processing. The experimental results demonstrate that comprehensive neutralization could enhance the neutrality of all components and represent features across a broader range of components, thereby improving generalization. Nullified neutralization enabled a compromise between neutrality maximization and error minimization. Through compressive and collective neutralization of a large number of compressed weights, it became possible to interpret compressed and collective weights. In particular, inputs that were considered relatively unimportant by conventional methods emerged as highly significant. Finally, these results were compared with those obtained in the field of the human-centered approach to provide a clearer understanding of the significance of contradiction resolution, applied to neural networks.

ID DECOMPOSITION-BASED ALGORITHM
AB Bilevel evolutionary algorithms (BLEAs) are a plausible approach for bilevel optimization. However, these algorithms require many fitness evaluations (FEs) and might become unusable if the fitness evaluations are computationally expensive. Therefore, reducing the number of FEs is crucial for designing a BLEA for expensive bilevel optimization (EBLOP). The surrogate-assisted optimization and knowledge transfer mechanisms used in BLEAs have been proven to reduce the number of FEs. This paper proposes a surrogate-assisted bilevel improved multioperator differential evolution algorithm (SA-BL-IMODE), which integrates a classification model-based assisted preselection and environment selection strategy (CPES) for EBLOP. In CPES, promising candidate solutions are prescreened by a classification model, filtering out some unpromising candidate solutions without performing FEs, thus improving the algorithm's performance. Moreover, the classification model also assists environment selection by directly discarding the unpromising offspring solutions before FEs are performed, thus reducing the number of FEs in each iteration. Additionally, an enhanced direct neighbor solution transfer (EDST) mechanism is proposed to identify and utilize the interactions between upper-level and lower-level variables for acquiring knowledge, improving knowledge quality, and reducing the number of FEs further. Experimental studies on two test suite benchmark problems are conducted, and the proposed method is compared with nine state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms and show that SA-BL-IMODE has a significant advantage over existing algorithms for expensive bilevel optimization.

ID ATTENTION; MODEL
AB The study of multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) problems has high significance in many areas, such as industrial forecasting and traffic flow forecasting. Traditional forecasting models pay more attention to the temporal features of variables and lack depth in extracting spatial and spatiotemporal features between variables. In this paper, a novel model based on the Transformer, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed to address the issues. The model first extracts the spatial feature vectors through the proposed Multi-kernel CNN. Then it fully extracts the temporal information by the Encoder layer that consists of the Transformer encoder layer and the LSTM network, which can also obtain the potential spatiotemporal correlation. To extract more feature information, we stack multiple Encoder layers. Finally, the output is decoded by the Decoder layer composed of the ReLU activation function and the Linear layer. To further improve the model's robustness, we also integrate an autoregressive model. In model evaluation, the proposed model achieves significant performance improvements over the current benchmark methods for MTSF tasks on four datasets. Further experiments demonstrate that the model can be used for long-horizon forecasting and achieve satisfactory results on the yield forecasting of test items (our private dataset, TIOB).

DE Constraint programming; Constraint propagation; Minimum explanations;
   Complexity
AB Explaining the outcome of programs has become one of the main concerns in AI research. In constraint programming, a user may want the system to explain why a given variable assignment is not feasible or how it came to the conclusion that the problem does not have any solution. One solution to the latter is to return to the user a sequence of simple reasoning steps that lead to inconsistency. Arc consistency is a well-known form of reasoning that can be understood by a human. We consider explanations as sequences of propagation steps of a constraint on a variable (i.e. the ubiquitous revise function in arc-consistency algorithms) that lead to inconsistency. We characterize several cases for which providing a shortest such explanation is easy: For instance when constraints are binary and variables have maximum degree two. However, these polynomial cases are tight. For instance, providing a shortest explanation is NP-hard when constraints are binary and the maximum degree is three, even if the number of variables is bounded. It remains NP-hard on trees, despite the fact that arc consistency is a decision procedure on trees. The problem is not even FPT-approximable unless the FPT not equal W[2] hypothesis is false.

AB Automated fault diagnosis can facilitate diagnostics assistance, speedier troubleshooting, and better-organised logistics. Currently, most AI-based prognostics and health management in the automotive industry ignore textual descriptions of the experienced problems or symptoms. With this study, however, we propose an ML-assisted workflow for automotive fault nowcasting that improves on current industry standards. We show that a multilingual pre-trained Transformer model can effectively classify the textual symptom claims from a large company with vehicle fleets, despite the task's challenging nature due to the 38 languages and 1357 classes involved. Overall, we report an accuracy of more than 80% for high-frequency classes and above 60% for classes with reasonable minimum support, bringing novel evidence that automotive troubleshooting management can benefit from multilingual symptom text classification.

AB The monocular vision system is a crucial branch of machine vision research widely used in multiple industries as a research hotspot in the field of vision. Although the monocular vision system is of simple structure and cost-effectiveness, its positioning accuracy is insufficient in some industries. This article researched the robot arm positioning method via monocular vision. First, we built a vision system model and designed the style of a cooperative target for target positioning. Second, a target feature screening method based on conditions is composed for the existence of interference. Furthermore, combining the principle of pose estimation on the PNP (Perspective-n-Point) problem with the results of the visual system calibration to realize the positioning of the target. Finally, complete the construction of the experimental platform and design accuracy evaluation experiments and positioning experiments. The experimental results show that the location measurement error range of the system in this article is below 4 mm, and the measurement error of the rotation angle is below 2 circle$$ {}<^>{\circ } $$. The system can adapt to the requirements of general industrial use.

AB With the rapid advancement of AI, there exists a possibility of rogue human actor(s) taking control of a potent AI system or an AI system redefining its objective function such that it presents an existential threat to mankind or severely curtails its freedom. Therefore, some suggest an outright ban on AI development while others profess international agreement on constraining specific types of AI. These approaches are untenable because countries will continue developing AI for national defense, regardless. Some suggest having an all-powerful benevolent one-AI that will act as an AI nanny. However, such an approach relies on the everlasting benevolence of one-AI, an untenable proposition. Furthermore, such an AI is itself subject to capture by a rogue actor. We present an alternative approach that uses existing mechanisms and time-tested economic concepts of competition and marginal analysis to limit centralization and integration of AI, rather than AI itself. Instead of depending on international consensus it relies on countries working in their best interests. We recommend that through regulation and subsidies countries promote independent development of competing AI technologies, especially those with decentralized architecture. The Sherman Antitrust Act can be used to limit the domain of an AI system, training module, or any of its components. This will increase the segmentation of potent AI systems and force technological incompatibility across systems. Finally, cross-border communication between AI-enabled systems should be restricted, something countries like China and the US are already inclined to do to serve their national interests. Our approach can ensure the availability of numerous sufficiently powerful AI systems largely disconnected from each other that can be called upon to identify and neutralize rogue systems when needed. This setup can provide sufficient deterrence to any rational human or AI system from attempting to exert undue control.

AB Multispectral optoacoustic tomography is a high-resolution functional imaging modality that can non-invasively access a broad range of pathophysiological phenomena. Real-time imaging would enable translation of multispectral optoacoustic tomography into clinical imaging, visualize dynamic pathophysiological changes associated with disease progression and enable in situ diagnoses. Model-based reconstruction affords state-of-the-art optoacoustic images but cannot be used for real-time imaging. On the other hand, deep learning enables fast reconstruction of optoacoustic images, but the lack of experimental ground-truth training data leads to reduced image quality for in vivo scans. In this work we achieve accurate optoacoustic image reconstruction in 31 ms per image for arbitrary (experimental) input data by expressing model-based reconstruction with a deep neural network. The proposed deep learning framework, DeepMB, generalizes to experimental test data through training on optoacoustic signals synthesized from real-world images and ground truth optoacoustic images generated by model-based reconstruction. Based on qualitative and quantitative evaluation on a diverse dataset of in vivo images, we show that DeepMB reconstructs images approximately 1,000-times faster than the iterative model-based reference method while affording near-identical image qualities. Accurate and real-time image reconstructions with DeepMB can enable full access to the high-resolution and multispectral contrast of handheld optoacoustic tomography, thus adoption into clinical routines.
   State-of-the-art image reconstruction for multispectral optoacoustic tomography is currently too slow for clinical applications. Dehner, Zahnd et al. propose a deep learning framework to reconstruct optoacoustic images in real-time while maintaining similar quality.

AB As conversational agents powered by large language models become more human-like, users are starting to view them as companions rather than mere assistants. Our study explores how changes to a person's mental model of an AI system affects their interaction with the system. Participants interacted with the same conversational AI, but were influenced by different priming statements regarding the AI's inner motives: caring, manipulative or no motives. Here we show that those who perceived a caring motive for the AI also perceived it as more trustworthy, empathetic and better-performing, and that the effects of priming and initial mental models were stronger for a more sophisticated AI model. Our work also indicates a feedback loop in which the user and AI reinforce the user's mental model over a short time; further work should investigate long-term effects. The research highlights the importance of how AI systems are introduced can notably affect the interaction and how the AI is experienced.
   The recent accessibility of large language models brought them into contact with a large number of users and, due to the social nature of language, it is hard to avoid prescribing human characteristics such as intentions to a chatbot. Pataranutaporn and colleagues investigated how framing a bot as helpful or manipulative can influence this perception and the behaviour of the humans that interact with it.

AB Shield construction in karst tunnels inevitably causes settlement deformation and even damage to surrounding buildings. To accurately evaluate the security of neighboring buildings, a hybrid method combining an improved cloud model (CM) and a Bayesian network (BN) is proposed for dynamic security analysis and the evaluation of neighboring buildings. First, through engineering practice, simulation analysis and literature research, the safety risk factors and evaluation criteria for adjacent buildings influenced by shield construction in karst areas are determined, and a BN for safety evaluations of adjacent buildings is constructed. The improved CM is used to model the uncertainty of the risk state, realize the discretization of continuous data and obtain prior knowledge. By improving the cloud Bayesian network (CBN) to perform three kinds of comprehensive analyses, including forward prediction reasoning in advance, sensitivity analysis and reverse risk diagnosis for events, and appropriate risk management and control measures, the dynamic safety perception and control of buildings adjacent to karst shield construction is realized. The data for buildings under construction adjacent to Guiyang Rail Transit Line 3 are used to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions of the research results are as follows: (a) The key risk factors affecting the safety of buildings adjacent to shield construction areas in karst zones are extracted, and an evaluation index system and an evaluation standard are established; (b) An improved CM is used to describe the fuzziness and uncertainty in the process of node state discretization in a risk inference network, thus improving the prediction and diagnosis performance of BN security evaluation models; (c) The improved cloud Bayesian model is applied to construct a knowledge representation-based safety model of buildings adjacent to karst shield construction areas, and accurate perception and control diagnosis results are obtained for effective safety risk prediction and control, providing a reference for other similar projects.

AB This study tenders a new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm (MA) based on the behavior of the Genghis Khan shark (GKS), called GKS optimizer (GKSO), which is used for numerical optimization and engineering design. The inspiration for GKSO comes from the predation and survival behavior of GKS, and the entire optimization process is achieved by simulating four different activities of GKS, including hunting (exploration), movement (exploitation), foraging (switch from exploration to exploitation), and self-protection mechanism. These operators are mimicked using various mathematical models to efficiently perform optimization tasks of agents in different regions of the search space. In an effort to validate this method's viability and superiority, an in-depth analysis of the proposed GKSO is carried out from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Qualitative analysis verifies that GKSO has good exploration and exploitation (ENE) capability. Simultaneously, GKSO is quantitatively analyzed with eight existing fish optimization algorithms and the other nine well-known MAs on CEC2019 and CEC2022, respectively. Among them, a series of experimental scenarios are conducted to validate the applicability and robustness of GKSO by exploring its performance for CEC2022 at different dimensions and maximum fitness evaluation quantity. Statistical results indicate that GKSO has a strong advantage in the competition between two different types of algorithms. Furthermore, five different kinds of real-world constrained optimization problems (OPs) in CEC2020 benchmark constrained optimization functions, including 50 engineering case suites, are selected to evaluate GKSO's performance and the other seven optimizers, further validating GKSO's extensive usefulness and validity in solving practical complex problems.

AB In recent decades, various domains such as military, aerospace and supply chain are becoming increasingly complex, forming system-of-systems (SoSs). The effectiveness of SoSs is mainly determined by their archi-tecture, thus selecting proper architecture for SoSs is crucial to maximize their effectiveness. While most studies focus on specific issues, such as mission planning and SoSs meta-architecture selection, few papers deal with the two issues together. This paper introduces the task oriented SoSs architecture selection problem (TSASP) and proposes an combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary algorithm (EA) (CRE) to address this problem. CRE comprises two layers: the inner layer utilizes a DQN-based algorithm to solve the mission planning problem, and the outer layer with improved genetic algorithm optimizes the SoSs architecture selection based on the output of inner one. A synthetic air and missile defense (AMD) example is conducted to test the effectiveness of proposed method, and results show that CRE can improve the mission planning effect by select a feasible architecture.

AB Deep learning models are often trained with a large amount of labeled data to improve the accuracy for moving object detection in new fields. However, the model may not be robust enough due to insufficient training data in the new field, resulting in some moving objects not being successfully detected. Training with data that is not successfully detected by the pre-trained deep learning model can effectively improve the accuracy for the new field, but it is costly to retrieve the image data containing the moving objects from millions of images per day to train the model. Therefore, we propose FenceTalk, a moving object detection system, which compares the difference between the current frame and the background image based on the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). FenceTalk automatically selects suspicious images with moving objects that are not successfully detected by the Yolo model, so that the training data can be selected at a lower labor cost. FenceTalk can effectively define and update the background image in the field, reducing the misjudgment caused by changes in light and shadow, and selecting images containing moving objects with an optimal threshold. Our study has demonstrated its performance and generality using real data from different fields. For example, compared with the pre-trained Yolo model using the MS COCO dataset, the overall recall of FenceTalk increased from 72.36% to 98.39% for the model trained with the data picked out by SSIM. The recall of FenceTalk, combined with Yolo and SSIM, can reach more than 99%.

AB The Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) is a newly developed framework that measures a building's technological readiness to improve its energy efficiency. The integration of data obtained from this framework with data derived from Building Information Modeling (BIM) has the potential to yield compelling results. This research proposes an algorithm for a Recommendation System (RS) that uses SRI and BIM data to advise on building energy-efficiency improvements. Following a modular programming approach, the proposed system is split into two algorithmic approaches linked with two distinct use cases. In the first use case, BIM data are utilized to provide thermal envelope enhancement recommendations. A hybrid Machine Learning (ML) (Random Forest-Decision Tree) algorithm is trained using an Industry Foundation Class (IFC) BIM model of CERTH'S nZEB Smart Home in Greece and Passive House database data. In the second use case, SRI data are utilized to develop an RS for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system improvement, in which a process utilizes a filtering function and KNN algorithm to suggest automation levels for building service improvements. Considering the results from both use cases, this paper provides a solid framework that exploits more possibilities for coupling SRI with BIM data. It presents a novel algorithm that exploits these data to facilitate the development of an RS system for increasing building energy efficiency.

AB Industrial robots play an indispensable role in flexible production lines, and the faults caused by degradation of equipment, motors, mechanical system joints, and even task diversity affect the efficiency of production lines and product quality. Aiming to achieve high-precision multiple size of fault diagnosis of robotic arms, this study presents a back propagation (BP) multiclassification neural network-based method for robotic arm fault diagnosis by taking feature fusion of position, attitude and acceleration of UR10 robotic arm end-effector to establish the database for neural network training. The new algorithm achieves an accuracy above 95% for fault diagnosis of each joint, and a diagnostic accuracy of up to 0.1 degree. It should be noted that the fault diagnosis algorithm can detect faults effectively in time, while avoiding complex mathematical operations.

AB In most industrial processes, it is impossible to collect samples of all fault modes, which greatly limits fault diagnosis applications in industrial fields. The fault diagnosis for the inaccessible fault modes having no labeled samples, termed zero-shot fault diagnosis, is quite challenging. This paper proposed an Attribute Fusion Transfer (AFT) for zero-shot fault diagnosis. First, we proposed a multi-Gaussian assumption for the posterior probability calculation in fault attribute transfer process and theoretically and experimentally proved its feasibility and effectiveness. Then, considering the ability difference of various attribute transfer methods to predict the same attribute, we proposed an attribute fusion network, which fuses the Bayesian fault attribute transfer and the attribute transfer under the multi-Gaussian assumption to attain better attribute transfer ability. Finally, AFT transfers fault attribute knowledge from accessible fault modes to inaccessible fault modes, thereby getting the ability to identify inaccessible fault modes. A series of ablation experiments and comparative experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman process were conducted to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of AFT fusion structure and the superiority of AFT. Furthermore, we conducted attribute -level and data-level interpretability analyses to reveal why our proposed AFT can obtain excellent zero-shot fault diagnosis ability.

AB The proposed intelligent framework seamlessly integrates degradation monitoring, defect identification, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for a comprehensive and holistic solution to bearing health assessment. It leverages a novel directed divergence (DD) measure to compare probability distributions, generating a Health Indicator (HI) that captures the health status of the bearings. This HI serves as the cornerstone for the framework's cohesive approach. An alert system, utilizing the modified Pauta criterion and iterative window scanning, enhances anomaly detection, while a double-check mechanism minimizes false alarms. For defect identification, dynamic analysis-assisted wavelet filtering harnesses a customized wavelet filter generated from simulated interactions between defective components and rolling elements. In parallel, the framework employs a graph convolution network (GCN) with a 1D health indicator, derived from the proposed directed divergence measure between the reference data and running conditions, to estimate RUL. By unifying these components, proposed framework offers an efficient, integrated, and proactive solution for monitoring, defect identification, and RUL estimation in bearing health assessment, ultimately enhancing system reliability and maintenance strategies.

AB Clustering problems are prevalent in areas such as transport and partitioning. Owing to the demand for centralized storage and limited resources, a complex variant of this problem has emerged, also referred to as the weakly balanced constrained clustering (WBCC) problem. Clusters must satisfy constraints regarding cluster weights and connectivity. However, existing methods fail to guarantee cluster connectivity in diverse scenarios, thereby resulting in additional transportation costs. In response to the aforementioned limitations, this study introduces a shelved-retrieved method. This method embeds adjacent relationships during power diagram construction to ensure cluster connectivity. Using the shelved-retrieved method, connected clusters are generated and iteratively adjusted to determine the optimal solutions. Further, experiments are conducted on three synthetic datasets, each with three objective functions, and the results are compared to those obtained using other techniques. Our method successfully generates clusters that satisfy the constraints imposed by the WBCC problem and consistently outperforms other techniques in terms of the evaluation measures.

AB A limited assessment of the development process and various stages of machine learning (ML) based solutions for construction engineering (CE) problems are available in the literature. After critically reviewing 467 published articles from 2017 to 2022, sixteen areas of improvement at different stages of ML projects' development cycle are identified and discussed with examples from past studies.

ID MODEL; INCONSISTENCIES
AB Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has been adopted as a mainstream design methodology for complex mechatronic systems. According to this paradigm, structured models, typically represented in SysML are used to describe the system of interest from various aspects. Among these models, the system behavior model is fundamental for the subsequent design and hence should be verified against system functions in the early design stage. However, due to the lack of formal semantics of the involved SysML models and software-physical hybrid characteristics of the mechatronic systems, it is not a trivial task to apply existing formal verification methods to solve this problem. In this study, a novel approach relying on hybrid functional semantics is proposed. First, this verification problem is formally defined based on an in-depth analysis of the architectures and traceability between the involved SysML models. Then, a graphical modeling language to represent the hybrid functional semantics in SysML is defined so that the function and behavior models can be enhanced and explicitly correlated by the formal semantics. Finally, based on the semantically enhanced models, the model verification problem is formally re-defined as a semantics verification problem and further divided into two sub-problems, i.e., continuous and discrete semantics verification problems, which are automatically solved by leveraging existing verification techniques including functional-effect compatibility check and symbolic model checking. A mobile robot is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Efficient control of energy-intensive systems is essential for reducing energy consumption and realizing sustainable development. However, considering the complex inter-dependent energy-consumption devices, numerous control parameters, and dynamic environments, the energy-efficient control of energy-intensive system is always challenging. To address such problems, this paper proposes a data-driven learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) method for the integrated control of various devices in energy-intensive systems. Specifically, a hybrid prediction model based on two variants of RNN is integrated with the MPC scheme to learn and predict the system dynamics based on massive time-series sensing data. Then an efficient tree-based prioritized group control model for heterogeneous devices is developed with a rolling optimization and feedback correction mode. A real-life case study is provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which demonstrates its superiority over existing methods on saving the energy consumption.

AB Data-driven models, such as deep learning , transfer learning algorithms, have achieved leading results in essential tool condition monitoring (TCM) during manufacturing process. However, these models perform differently under available dataset with various sample scales in these factories, leading to poor application extensiveness in engineering. Besides, Siamese neural network (SNN) has been applied in machine condition identification, but how to apply the model on tool wear regression has not attracted much attention. Therefore, a novel SNN framework, called global frequency context channel optimized regressive SNN - support vector regression (GFCC-RSNN-SVR), is proposed and optimized to predict tool wear values practically. Firstly, Stockwell transform is utilized for time-frequency image generation from raw signal. Then, regressive SNN framework is constructed based on convolutional neural blocks and enhanced by novel attention mechanism layer. After model training, support vector regression (SVR) submodel is constructed for final tool wear prediction. Moreover, milling experiments has been designed and conducted , the dataset and public ones have been chosen for the following cases study. Further comparison experiments have validated the brilliant performance of the proposed model, and the effectiveness of Stockwell transform, RSNN framework, and the attention mechanism, regardless of training sample scales.

AB Digital fringe projection profilometry often faces a trade-off between measurement accuracy and efficiency. Defocus technology is commonly employed to address this challenge and improve the efficiency of high-speed three-dimensional (3D) measurement. This technology uses 1-bit binary fringe patterns instead of traditional 8-bit sinusoidal patterns, but accurately measuring 3D shapes with both high speed and accuracy remains a challenge due to defocus errors. These errors are introduced by the manual adjustment of lens focal length and reduce both fringe pattern quality and measurement accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multistage generative adversarial network with a self-attention mechanism to correct inaccurate fringe patterns and transform them into more ideal sinusoidal fringe patterns. Our generation network comprises a multi-stage feature extraction network with a self-attention mechanism and an encoder-decoder network. A multi-stage network integrating residual and transformer modules is constructed to mine global feature information. The self-attention mechanism accurately detects key areas for correction, and the encoder-decoder network generates rectified sinusoidal fringe patterns by combining the feature information with the attention area. We use a discriminative network to evaluate whether the output of the generative network is good enough to be true. In our experiments, we considered different fringe widths and measured objects of various types and colors. The results show that our proposed method improves the quality of defocus fringe patterns and the accuracy of subsequent 3D reconstruction compared to existing direct defocus methods.

   network model; Preference prediction
ID REQUIREMENTS
AB Customer preference-involved product concept evaluation is a vital stage for developing new products. One of the key factors in this stage is to mine the potential relationships between customers' needs and technical requirements. In most new product development (NPD), design characteristics (DCs) are employed as performance indicators to describe the technical requirements of a scheme. Previous studies have focused on evaluating the degree to which a scheme meets the performance value of DCs, disregarding the relationship between DCs and potential user preferences. This oversight leads to an inability to accurately predict customer satisfaction with the candidate schemes based on their preferences. Previous research, which was aimed at ensuring the preference value of schemes by utilizing mapping data between design preference (DP) and DCs, overlooked users' psychological states and thus failed to accurately capture their cognitive preferences for the schemes. To address these issues, an electroencephalogram (EEG) data-driven, implicit DP prediction approach is proposed. The method characterizes the implicit cognitive relationship between DP and DCs by mining EEG data and utilizes a back propagation (BP) neural network to predict DP. First, a user's DP word pairs were constructed based on the approach of statistical analysis, and the best-worst method (BWM) was introduced to obtain the importance of DCs. Second, an experiment was designed based on the extracted preference word pairs to collect EEG data that reflect a user's DC preference, record the user's stimulation state toward the DCs, and label their DP based on the segmentation results of preference evaluation. Third, a BP neural network was employed to construct a preference prediction model for DCs, and the reliability of the proposed preference prediction model was validated by using the forklift design example. The prediction results further exhibited the potential association between user preferences and DCs that can be acquired by EEG data mining. The results also provide support for designers to promptly acquire design concepts that satisfy user requirements (URs), thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of product development in a highly competitive market.

AB The current deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods have achieved excellent classification performance under supervised training, but the existence of domain discrepancy under different working conditions will greatly affect data relationship mining and fault diagnosis accuracy. Graph convolutional network (GCN) with topological structured relationships is excellent in solving these issues. In this paper, structural discrepancy and domain adversarial fusion network (SDDAFN) is proposed to learn deep high-dimensional features and eliminate distribution discrepancy across different domains. In data structure construction, the high dimensional mapping features are first extracted accurately from the input raw signals by a feature encoder, then the output of encoder is converted into an instance graph through graph construction layer (GCL) for the convenient modeling by multi-channel kernel GCN (MCK-GCN). In network optimization, the classification loss function is introduced to optimize the discrimination boundaries of different fault types, and the integrated loss function based on structural discrepancy and domain adversarial are jointly adopted to minimize the domain distribution discrepancy. Experimental cases show the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Multiple laser stripe measurement (MLSM) is a vital technique in optical three-dimensional (3D) measurement. The accurate extraction of the laser stripe centerlines plays a decisive role in achieving high measurement accuracy. However, complex 3D measurement scenarios pose challenges due to various interferences, such as optical interference caused by dense stripes and no-ideal distribution caused by non-uniform reflectivity. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive step size gradient centerline extraction method based on an 2D linear filter. This method incorporates local adaptive variable parameters for fine-tuning while utilizing global parameters. We validate its performance by conducting comprehensive comparative experiments with two commonly used methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method enables more precise centerline extraction, exhibits enhanced stability, and yields lower measurement errors in complex 3D measurement conditions and highlight the effectiveness and superior performance of our method.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The Hausdorff distance between two closed sets has important theoretical and practical applications. Yet apart from finite point clouds, there appear to be no generic algorithms for computing this quantity. Because many infinite sets are defined by algebraic equalities and inequalities, this a huge gap. The current paper constructs Frank-Wolfe and projected gradient ascent algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between two compact convex sets. Although these algorithms are guaranteed to go uphill, they can become trapped by local maxima. To avoid this defect, we investigate a homotopy method that gradually deforms two balls into the two target sets. The Frank-Wolfe and projected gradient algorithms are tested on two pairs (A,B) of compact convex sets, where: (1) A is the box [-1,1] translated by 1 and B is the intersection of the unit ball and the non-negative orthant; and (2) A is the probability simplex and B is the l1 unit ball translated by 1. For problem (2), we find the Hausdorff distance analytically. Projected gradient ascent is more reliable than the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and finds the exact solution of problem (2). Homotopy improves the performance of both algorithms when the exact solution is unknown or unattained.

AB The exploration of the energy landscape of a chemical system is essential for understanding and predicting its observable properties. In most cases, this is a challenging task due to the high complexity of such landscapes, which often consist of multiple, possibly hierarchical basins that are difficult to locate and thoroughly explore. In this study, we introduce a novel method, called IGLOO (Iterative Global Exploration and Local Optimization), which aims to achieve a more efficient global exploration of the conformational space compared to existing techniques. The method utilizes a tree-based exploration inspired by the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm originating from robotics. IGLOO dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy to both homogeneously scan the landscape and focus on promising regions, avoiding redundant exploration. We evaluated IGLOO using models of two polypeptides and compared its performance to the traditional basin-hopping method and a hybrid method that also incorporates the RRT algorithm. We find that IGLOO outperforms both alternative methods in terms of efficiently and comprehensively exploring the molecular conformational space. This approach can be easily generalized to other chemical systems such as molecules on surfaces or crystalline systems.

AB Missing or unavailable data (NA) in multivariate data analysis is often treated with imputation methods and, in some cases, records containing NA are eliminated, leading to the loss of information. This paper addresses the problem of NA in multiple factor analysis (MFA) without resorting to eliminating records or using imputation techniques. For this purpose, the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) algorithm is proposed based on the principle of available data. NIPALS presents a good alternative when data imputation is not feasible. Our proposed method is called MFA-NIPALS and, based on simulation scenarios, we recommend its use until 15% of NAs of total observations. A case of groups of quantitative variables is studied and the proposed NIPALS algorithm is compared with the regularized iterative MFA algorithm for several percentages of NA.

AB Building permit processes lie on the divide between architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) and public administration. To ensure consistent and effective digitization in building permitting, it is necessary to consider and merge both areas. Hence, for advanced building permit processes, foundations must be developed, which begins with understanding and formalizing building permit authorities' organizational structures and processes. Therefore, this study developed an ontology that covers a semantic representation of a building permit authority along with a subprocess of the building permit process called the assignment process. The assignment process describes how and on what basis building applications are assigned to appropriate building officials. Proposing a semantic representation of the assignment process, tacit knowledge from previously conducted data sets was analyzed and implemented in the ontology. As a case study, a sample building permit authority was described and implemented in the ontology. On the one hand, the developed ontology serves as a basis for decision support for building permit processes, while on the other hand, it enables a fully automated assignment process in a building permit authority. The approach not only makes the assignment process more objective and transparent for all parties involved in the building permit process but also allows time and personnel capacities to be used in its other subprocesses.

AB The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) is a research hotspot in the shop scheduling problem. However, few studies have investigated HFSP involving parallel machine scheduling and worker competencies. Therefore, this study investigates a complex product assembly line scheduling problem considering parallel team scheduling, worker competencies, and transport time. The makespan, transport time, imbalance degree of team workload, and imbalance degree of cycle time are taken as optimization objectives. First, a mathematical model considering transport time and worker competencies is developed, and then a mixed encoding and decoding method is proposed. Second, an algorithm that hybridizes the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed, involving an improved Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic method and a strengthened elite retention strategy to improve the quality of the solution. Finally, based on nine examples generated from real production statuses, the proposed algorithm is compared with the other four algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior in terms of the quality and efficiency of solutions.

AB Formalizing health maintenance activities for the whole equipment lifecycle is significantly challenging in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO). It can support computer-aided managing and tracking maintenance activities, reducing the frequency of equipment failures and ensuring stable production operation, thereby reducing production costs and increasing enterprise profit. There are two problems formalizing health maintenance activities for the equipment lifecycle. The common formalizing modeling approaches, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), are readable and writable for computers but not friendly for human beings. There are various maintenance strategies adopted to assure equipment reliability in a real production scenario, and it is complex to formalize massive maintenance activities under different strategies. Thus, the research aims to propose a model for formalizing health maintenance activities that is friendly to both computer and human reading and writing and can manage and track massive maintenance activities under different strategies. In this regard, an event-state triggering mechanism-based graphical model for formalizing health maintenance activities in the context of the whole equipment lifecycle is proposed. First, the meta model of the Maintenance Graphical Model (MGM) based on the event-state triggering mechanism is introduced, clarifying the model unit and lifecycle model. Second, the Bill of Material (BOM) based configuration mechanism of the graphical model for specific equipment is presented. Third, the operation mechanism of the graphical model for managing and tracking the maintenance activities of equipment is illustrated. Finally, a real case of kneader, the production equipment of prebaked anode for aluminum electrolysis, is applied to verify our theory. The case demonstrates that the proposed model can reduce the frequency of equipment failures, maintenance time, and maintenance costs.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; MODEL; ACCURACY
AB In this paper, a shapelet-based behavioral pattern extraction method (Behavior2Shapelets) is proposed to address the behavior-sparsity issue in credit risk classification. In the proposed method, three steps are involved. First, by introducing the shapelets module, the proposed model can learn the behavioral patterns from the sparse behavioral features. Then, these extracted patterns are combined with a logistic regression model to construct an interpretable classifier. Finally, to enhance the robustness of the model, a dynamic strategy for threshold determination is used, which is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The performance of the Behavior2Shapelets model is validated by using the Taiwan credit dataset and its seven derivative datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that the Behavior2Shapelets model outperforms the baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. This highlights the feasibility of the proposed model as a solution to the behaviorsparsity problem in credit risk classification.

AB This study examines the potential of the soft computing technique, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), genetic programming (GP), classification and regression trees (CART) and GA-ENN (genetic algorithm-emotional neuron network), to predict the ultimate bearing capacity (UBC) of cohesionless soils beneath shallow foundations. For the first time, two grey-box AI models, GP and CART, and one hybrid AI model, GA-ENN, were used in the literature to predict UBC. The inputs of the model are the width of footing (B), depth of footing (D), footing geometry (ratio of length to width, L/B), unit weight of sand (gamma d or gamma '), and internal friction angle (phi). The results of the present model were compared with those obtained via two theoretical approaches and one AI approach reported in the literature. The statistical evaluation of results shows that the presently applied paradigm is better than the theoretical approaches and is competing well for the prediction of qu. This study shows that the developed AI models are a robust model for the qu prediction of shallow foundations on cohesionless soil. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to determine the effect of each input parameter. The findings showed that the width and depth of the foundation and unit weight of soil (gamma d or gamma ') played the most significant roles, while the internal friction angle and L/B showed less importance in predicting qu.

DE point cloud geometry compression; transformers; convolution
AB Due to the often substantial size of the real-world point cloud data, efficient transmission and storage have become critical concerns. Point cloud compression plays a decisive role in addressing these challenges. Recognizing the importance of capturing global information within point cloud data for effective compression, many existing point cloud compression methods overlook this crucial aspect. To tackle this oversight, we propose an innovative end-to-end point cloud compression method designed to extract both global and local information. Our method includes a novel Transformer module to extract rich features from the point cloud. Utilization of a pooling operation that requires no learnable parameters as a token mixer for computing long-distance dependencies ensures global feature extraction while significantly reducing both computations and parameters. Furthermore, we employ convolutional layers for feature extraction. These layers not only preserve the spatial structure of the point cloud, but also offer the advantage of parameter independence from the input point cloud size, resulting in a substantial reduction in parameters. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TransPCGC network. It achieves average Bjontegaard Delta Rate (BD-Rate) gains of 85.79% and 80.24% compared to Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC). Additionally, in comparison to the Learned-PCGC network, our approach attains an average BD-Rate gain of 18.26% and 13.83%. Moreover, it is accompanied by a 16% reduction in encoding and decoding time, along with a 50% reduction in model size.

AB Falls are a major problem in hospitals, and physical or chemical restraints are commonly used to "protect" patients in hospitals and service users in hostels, especially elderly patients with dementia. However, physical and chemical restraints may be unethical, detrimental to mental health and associated with negative side effects. Building upon our previous development of the wandering behavior monitoring system "eNightLog", we aimed to develop a non-contract restraint-free multi-depth camera system, "eNightTrack", by incorporating a deep learning tracking algorithm to identify and notify about fall risks. Our system evaluated 20 scenarios, with a total of 307 video fragments, and consisted of four steps: data preparation, instance segmentation with customized YOLOv8 model, head tracking with MOT (Multi-Object Tracking) techniques, and alarm identification. Our system demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.8% with 5 missed warnings out of 154 cases. The eNightTrack system was robust to the interference of medical staff conducting clinical care in the region, as well as different bed heights. Future research should take in more information to improve accuracy while ensuring lower computational costs to enable real-time applications.

AB The aim of this study is to solve the problem of increasing the efficiency of fuel and energy complex enterprises. Because such enterprises are complex systems, it is difficult to optimize their work, taking into account all the technical indicators of such enterprises. This study proposes to solve this problem by defining an algorithm using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. In particular, the algorithm was applied in heating systems using the example of a combined heat and power plant, where the DEA method had not previously been used. Experiments were carried out to improve the efficiency of the combined heat and power plant. Efficiency indicators were calculated, changing inputs and outputs of the model according to the study case to achieve the maximum efficiency of the system. The Charnes; Cooper and Rhodes; and the Banker, Charnes, and Cooper models were tested with good results. The presented methodology and experimental results enabled the DEA method to be applied for the first time to improve the efficiency of fuel and energy companies.

ID APPROXIMATION
AB When designed correctly, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks can approximate mathematical functions to any arbitrary degree of precision. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are also universal function approximators, but RBF neural networks can often be trained several orders of magnitude more quickly than an MLP network with an equivalent level of function approximation capability. The primary challenge with designing a high-quality RBF neural network is selecting the best values for the network's "centers", which can be thought of as geometric locations within the input space. Traditionally, the locations for the RBF nodes' centers are chosen either through random sampling of the training data or by using k-means clustering. The current paper proposes a new algorithm for selecting the locations of the centers by relying on a structure known as an "opportunity matrix". The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against that of the random sampling and k-means clustering methods using a large set of experiments involving both a real-world dataset from the steel industry and a variety of mathematical and statistical functions. The results indicate that the proposed opportunity matrix algorithm is almost always much better at selecting locations for an RBF network's centers than either of the two traditional techniques, yielding RBF neural networks with superior function approximation capabilities.

AB With the improvement of satellite autonomy, multi-satellite cooperative mission planning has become an important application. This requires multiple satellites to interact with each other via inter-satellite links to reach a consistent mission planning scheme. Considering issues such as inter-satellite link failure, external interference, and communication delay, algorithms should minimize communication costs as much as possible. The CBBA algorithm belongs to a fully distributed multi-agent task allocation algorithm, which has been introduced into multi-satellite autonomous task planning scenarios and achieved good planning results. This paper mainly focuses on the communication problem, and proposes an improved algorithm based on it, which is called c-CBBA. The algorithm is designed with task preemption strategy and single-chain strategy to reduce the communication volume. The task preemption strategy is an accelerated convergence mechanism designed for the convergence characteristics of CBBA, while the single-chain strategy is a communication link pruning strategy designed for the information exchange characteristics of satellites. Experiments in various scenarios show that the algorithm can effectively reduce communication volume while ensuring the effectiveness of task planning.

ID LIMITED-MEMORY
AB While first-order methods are popular for solving optimization problems arising in deep learning, they come with some acute deficiencies. To overcome these shortcomings, there has been recent interest in introducing second-order information through quasi-Newton methods that are able to construct Hessian approximations using only gradient information. In this work, we study the performance of stochastic quasi-Newton algorithms for training deep neural networks. We consider two well-known quasi-Newton updates, the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the symmetric rank one (SR1). This study fills a gap concerning the real performance of both updates in the minibatch setting and analyzes whether more efficient training can be obtained when using the more robust BFGS update or the cheaper SR1 formula, which-allowing for indefinite Hessian approximations-can potentially help to better navigate the pathological saddle points present in the non-convex loss functions found in deep learning. We present and discuss the results of an extensive experimental study that includes many aspects affecting performance, like batch normalization, the network architecture, the limited memory parameter or the batch size. Our results show that stochastic quasi-Newton algorithms are efficient and, in some instances, able to outperform the well-known first-order Adam optimizer, run with the optimal combination of its numerous hyperparameters, and the stochastic second-order trust-region STORM algorithm.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) usually require monitoring of massive road networks and gathering traffic data at a high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to the accumulation of substantial data volumes, necessitating the development of more concise data representations. Approaches like principal component analysis (PCA), which operate within subspaces, can construct precise low-dimensional models. However, interpreting these models can be challenging, primarily because the principal components often encompass a multitude of links within the traffic network. To overcome this issue, this study presents a novel approach for representing and indexing network traffic conditions through weighted CUR matrix decomposition integrated with clustering analysis. The proposed approach selects a subset group of detectors from the original network to represent and index traffic condition through a matrix decomposition method, allowing for more efficient management and analysis. The proposed method is evaluated using traffic detector data from the city of Nashville, TN. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in representing and indexing network traffic conditions, with high accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this study contributes to the field of network traffic monitoring by proposing a novel approach for representing massive traffic networks and exploring the effects of incorporating clustering into CUR decomposition. The proposed approach can help traffic analysts and practitioners to more efficiently manage and analyze traffic conditions, ultimately leading to more effective transportation systems.

AB Recommender system usually suffers from severe popularity bias - the collected interaction data usually exhibits quite imbalanced or even long-tailed distribution over items. Such skewed distribution may result from the users' conformity to the group, which deviates from reflecting users' true preference. Existing efforts for tackling this issue mainly focus on completely eliminating popularity bias. However, we argue that not all popularity bias is evil. Popularity bias not only results from conformity but also item quality, which is usually ignored by existing methods. Some items exhibit higher popularity as they have intrinsic better property. Blindly removing the popularity bias would lose such important signal, and further deteriorate model performance. To sufficiently exploit such important information for recommendation, it is essential to disentangle the benign popularity bias caused by item quality from the harmful popularity bias caused by conformity. Although important, it is quite challenging as we lack an explicit signal to differentiate the two factors of popularity bias. In this paper, we propose to leverage temporal information as the two factors exhibit quite different patterns along the time: item quality revealing item inherent property is stable and static while conformity that depends on items' recent clicks is highly time-sensitive. Correspondingly, we further propose a novel Time-aware DisEntangled framework (TIDE), where a click is generated from three components namely the static item quality, the dynamic conformity effect, as well as the user-item matching score returned by any recommendation model. Lastly, we conduct interventional inference so that the recommendation can benefit from the benign popularity bias while circumvent the harmful one. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of TIDE.

AB Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is recommended in guiding coronary intervention. The segmentation of coronary lumen and external elastic membrane (EEM) borders in IVUS images is a key step, but the manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, and suffers from inter-observer variability. In this paper, we propose a novel perceptual organisation-aware selective transformer framework that can achieve accurate and robust segmentation of the vessel walls in IVUS images. In this framework, temporal context-based feature encoders extract efficient motion features of vessels. Then, a perceptual organisation-aware selective transformer module is proposed to extract accurate boundary information, supervised by a dedicated boundary loss. The obtained EEM and lumen segmentation results will be fused in a temporal constraining and fusion module, to determine the most likely correct boundaries with robustness to morphology. Our proposed methods are extensively evaluated in non-selected IVUS sequences, including normal, bifurcated, and calcified vessels with shadow artifacts. The results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art, with a Jaccard measure of 0.92 for lumen and 0.94 for EEM on the IVUS 2011 open challenge dataset. This work has been integrated into a software QCU-CMS1 to automatically segment IVUS images in a user-friendly environment.

AB This article introduces a novel model of asymmetric neural networks combined with fractional differ-ence memristors, which has both theoretical and practical implications in the rapidly evolving field of computational intelligence. The proposed model includes two types of fractional difference memristor elements: one with hyperbolic tangent memductance and the other with periodic memductance and memristor state described by sine functions. The authenticity of the constructed memristor is confirmed through fingerprint verification. The research extensively investigates the dynamics of a coupled neural network model, analyzing its stability at equilibrium states, studying bifurcation diagrams, and calculating the largest Lyapunov exponents. The results suggest that when incorporating sine memristors, the model demonstrates coexisting state variables depending on the initial conditions, revealing the emergence of multi-layer attractors. The article further demonstrates how the memristor state shifts through numerical simulations with varying memductance values. Notably, the study emphasizes the crucial role of memductance (synaptic weight) in determining the complex dynamical characteristics of neural network systems. To support the analytical results and demonstrate the chaotic response of state variables, the article includes appropriate numerical simulations. These simulations effectively validate the presented findings and provide concrete evidence of the system's chaotic behavior.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a widely used tool to support decisions in which a set of alternatives should be ranked or classified based on multiple criteria. Recent studies in MCDA have shown the relevance of considering not only current evaluations of each criterion but also past data. Past-data-based approaches carry new challenges, especially in time-varying environments. This study deals with this challenge via essential tools of signal processing, such as tensorial representations and adaptive prediction. More specifically, we structure the criteria' past data as a tensor and, by applying adaptive prediction, we compose signals with these prediction values of the criteria. Besides, we transform the prediction in the time domain into a most favorable decision making domain, called the feature domain. We present a novel extension of the MCDA method PROMETHEE II, aimed at addressing the tensor in the feature domain to obtain a ranking of alternatives. Numerical experiments were performed using real-world time series, and our approach is compared with other existing strategies. The results highlight the relevance and efficiency of our proposal, especially for nonstationary time series.

AB An external magnetic field can be used to remotely control small-scaled robots, making them promising candidates for diverse biomedical and engineering applications. In a previous study, we showed that our magnetically actuated millirobot is highly agile and can perform a variety of locomotive tasks such as pivot walking, tumbling, and tapping in a horizontal plane. In this study, we focus on controlling the locomotion outcomes of this millirobot in the pivot walking mode. A mathematical model of the system is developed and the kinematic model is derived. The role of the sweep and tilt angles in the robot's motion is also investigated.We study two controllers to regulate the gait of the pivot walker. The first one is a proportional geometric-based controller, which determines the correct pivot point that the millirobot should use. Then, it regulates the angular velocity proportionally based on the error between the center of the millirobot and the reference trajectory. The second controller is based on a gradient descent optimization technique, which expresses the control action as an optimization problem. These control algorithms enable the millirobot to generate a stable gait while tracking the desired trajectory. A low-cost high-performance magnetic actuator is built to validate the proposed controllers. We conduct a set of different experiments and simulation runs to establish the effectiveness of proposed controllers for different sweep and tilt angles in terms of tracking error. The two controllers exhibit an appropriate performance, but it is observed that the gradient descent-based controller yields faster convergence time, smaller tracking error, and fewer number of steps. Finally, we perform an extensive experimentally parametric analysis of the effect of sweep and tilt angles and step time on the tracking error. As we expect, the optimization-based controller outperforms the geometric-based one.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, various methods for 6D pose and shape estimation of objects at a per-category level have been proposed. This work provides an overview of the field in terms of methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols. First, an overview of existing works and their commonalities and differences is provided. Second, we take a critical look at the predominant evaluation protocol, including metrics and datasets. Based on the findings, we propose a new set of metrics, contribute new annotations for the Redwood dataset, and evaluate state-of-the-art methods in a fair comparison. The results indicate that existing methods do not generalize well to unconstrained orientations and are actually heavily biased towards objects being upright. We provide an easy-to-use evaluation toolbox with welldefined metrics, methods, and dataset interfaces, which allows evaluation and comparison with various state-of-the-art approaches (https://github.com/roym899/pose_and_shape_evaluation).(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Just-in-time Learning (JITL) is a soft measurement method commonly used in industrial processes, which can update local models in real-time to solve the problem of inaccurate parameter measurement caused by dynamic changes in real chemical processes. At present, the accuracy of the similarity measurement of JITL is insufficient. The modeling is time consuming when there is too much historical data. Considering the applicability of different chemical processes, the local model needs to be further designed. Therefore, this study aims to address these limitations, an efficient JITL Framework based on Adaptive multi-branch variable scale integrated convolutional neural networks (EJITL-AMVs-ICNN) is proposed. Firstly, a mixed similarity measurement method with feature factors (MSM-FF) is proposed and used as the distance measurement method in K-means cluster to achieve data binning. Then, the most similar training samples are selected in the corresponding bin by the adaptive sample length selection method. Finally, the local model is established through AMVs-ICNN, which can establish the corresponding network structure according to the number of features of different chemical processes. Two chemical process datasets, the ebullated bed residue hydrogenation and physical separation unit were used to verify that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and lower elapsed time.

AB Hurricanes are one of the most destructive natural disasters, and proper preparation and mitigation are essential to enhance resilience. However, homeowners may have inaccurate risk perceptions, resulting in inadequate mitigation decision-making. Virtual reality (VR) damage visualization has the potential to communicate hurri-cane risk effectively and improve disaster resilience. Previous studies utilizing VR for hurricanes have primarily focused on disaster response such as evacuation, and often presented generalized visualization consistent across all users. This study presents a methodology for offering individual users a customized tool to experience the impacts of hypothetical hurricane events on their residential structures and explore the effects of various building retrofit actions in customized 3D virtual environments. The methodology was tested with 25 participants. Par-ticipants experienced structural damage and utility disruptions caused by hurricanes in their own residential homes in a customized, immersive virtual environment. Participants' pre-and post-VR risk perceptions, as well as their choices of mitigation actions were surveyed. The results indicate that customized VR was effective in enhancing risk awareness and that participants were able to reduce their structural damages in hypothetical hurricane events by adopting various mitigation measures after the customized VR experience. The outcomes suggest that customized visualization of potential damages in virtual environments can effectively help disaster preparation and mitigation.

AB Crack monitoring has been a hot research topic in structural health monitoring. However, the current research on deep learning-based crack image focuses more on cracks at a certain moment and ignores the full-time crack expansion details, which are crucial for more reasonable evaluation and safety quantification of concrete structures. This paper proposes a new method based on the combination of improved You Only Look Once v7 (YOLOv7) algorithm, crack expansion benchmark method, improved DeepLabv3+ algorithm, and image pro-cessing technology to monitor the whole process of crack development, including real-time crack recognition and real-time monitoring of crack dynamic expansion. The precision of the improved detection algorithm can be improved by a maximum of 5.34%, and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the improved segmentation algorithm can be improved by 0.15%, resulting in better segmentation results. The experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately achieve real-time tracking of crack dynamic expansion, especially for monitoring of tiny cracks.

AB The accurate determination of the tool-wear state helps workers maximise tool utilisation while reducing waste. It also ensures the machining quality and improves the machining efficiency. This study proposed a deep learning network based on the self-attention mechanism that enabled global modeling and long-term dependence for better tool wear state recognition by cutting signals. The Hierarchical Temporal Transformer Network (HTT-Net) was constructed by improving the Swin Transformer backbone network to enable the global modeling of the input temporal sequence signal. The token merging layer is used to build a hierarchical feature map, that enables the model to continuously increase the receptive field and improve its global modeling capability. Self-attention calculation is performed on the temporal sequence data partition window, which reduces the complexity of the model from a quadratic into a linear form of the sequence length. The shifted window enables information interaction between non-overlapping windows, which can improve the global modeling capability of the model. PHM2010 public cutting data and TC4 milling data were used for model training and test. The results showed that the tool wear state recognition capability of HTT-Net on the PHM2010 dataset outperformed the models in existing studies, with up to 16.13% improvement in recognition accuracy on the relevant dataset. The recognition accuracy on the TC4 milling dataset can reach 98.87%, which further verified the actual application capability of the model. At last, The Q-Q graph analysis verified that the model had strong robustness and stability, and the ablation experiment verified that each module of the model had positive gain on the recognition results.

AB In this paper, new automated container terminals equipped with Unilateral-cantilever Rail-Mounted Gantry Cranes (URMGC) are considered as the research object. In the scenario, the automated guided vehicles can go deep among the container blocks arranged perpendicularly to the shoreline, which completely changes the yard's operation mode and affects its operational efficiency. In addition, considering the shortage of storage space in the yard, a flexible space allocation strategy for these yards is studied, and a mixed integer quadratic programming model is established to minimize the horizontal transportation cost of containers. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to compensate for the increased complexity of the proposed model. To accelerate the solution speed, the quantity and priority rules are developed to generate reasonable initial solutions, and two velocity updating strategies are adopted to accelerate convergence. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and comparisons with fixed space allocation strategy are presented. The results show that the strategy and solution adopted in this paper can reduce the driving distance of AGVs in such terminal configurations effectively and potentially increase the handling capacity of the yard.

AB Considering the dynamic risk factors and risk situation throughout the entire deep excavation operations, timely adjustment and optimization of safety measures can enhance the practicality of construction technical plans on sites. A digital and quantitative model representing the practical risk situation of the deep excavation is urgently required for realizing the prediction, optimization, and control of the actual construction state. Thus, this research aims to propose a real-world-oriented model integrating Bayesian network (BN) and design structure matrix (DSM) for decision-making in safety risk management. First, risk factors were identified, and the BN model was established to evaluate the anti-risk ability of the construction site. Then, a multi-objective safety measure optimization model under specific constraints was established. Particularly, the DSM was adopted to express the control relationship between risk factors and safety measures. Moreover, with genetic algorithms applied, the optimal safety measure set for on-site safety risk management can be obtained. For model validation, a deep excavation project of metro construction in Wuhan, China, was selected as a case study. The hybrid optimization model showed the characters of initiative and timeliness in construction risk management. By providing the timely and optimized combination of safety measures, the dynamic decision-making approach can proactively and effectively improve the risk resistance ability of construction sites.

AB Bridges occasionally suffer from the vehicle or ship collision accidents, leading to structural damage and bridge collapse, resulting in severe consequences such as casualties, ship sinking, and vehicle damage. After such accidents, the performance evaluation of bridge structures is significant for bridge maintenance. The bridge's structural performance should be assessed after a collision with a vehicle or ship before regular traffic is resumed. A gray correlation analysis technique was introduced for the swift and efficient assessment of bridge structural performance following impacts. This method aimed to identify the influential parameters associated with bridge structural performance. Utilizing outcomes from dynamic load tests along with the Gaussian process regression model, adjustments were made to the original finite element analysis model. This refinement facilitated precise scrutiny of structural damage and expedited accurate performance evaluations of the bridge. Subsequently, a practical examination was carried out following a ship collision with the Wanjiang Bridge to validate the viability and precision of the proposed approach. A comparison between performance evaluation outcomes derived from the bridge's structural response to ship collision and actual field test results demonstrated the substantial accuracy and computational efficacy of the suggested technique. The proposed method uses a dynamic load test combined with an intelligent algorithm to replace the static load test, effectively solving the expensive, timeconsuming, traffic-impeding static load test problem.

AB Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown promising capability in learning text representation. However, existing text-based NAS neither performs a learnable fusion of neural operations to optimize the architecture nor encodes the latent hierarchical categorization behind text input. This article presents a novel NAS method, Discretized Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DDNAS), for text representation learning and classification. With the continuous relaxation of architecture representation, DDNAS can use gradient descent to optimize the search. We also propose a novel discretization layer via mutual information maximization, which is imposed on every search node to model the latent hierarchical categorization in text representation. Extensive experiments conducted on eight diverse real datasets exhibit that DDNAS can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art NAS methods. While DDNAS relies on only three basic operations, i.e., convolution, pooling, and none, to be the candidates of NAS building blocks, its promising performance is noticeable and extensible to obtain further improvement by adding more different operations.

ID RECOMMENDATION
AB As a fundamental problem in human mobility modeling, location prediction forecasts a user's next location based on historical user mobility trajectories. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have beenwidely used to capture sequential patterns of user visited locations for solving location prediction problems. Due to the sparse nature of real-world user mobility trajectories, existing techniques strive to improve RNNs by incorporating spatiotemporal contexts into the recurrent hidden state passing process of RNNs using context-parameterized transition matrices or gates. However, such a scheme mismatches universal spatiotemporal mobility laws and thus cannot fully benefit from rich spatiotemporal contexts encoded in user mobility trajectories. Against this background, we propose Flashback++, a general RNN architecture designed for modeling sparse user mobility trajectories. It not only leverages rich spatiotemporal contexts to search past hidden states with high predictive power but also learns to optimally combine them via a hidden state re-weighting mechanism, which significantly improves the robustness of the models against different settings and datasets. Our extensive evaluation compares Flashback++ against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world location-based social networks datasets and one on-campus mobility dataset. Results show that Flashback++ not only consistently and significantly outperforms all baseline techniques by 20.56% to 44.36% but also achieves better robustness of location prediction performance against different model settings (different RNN architectures and numbers of hidden states to flash back), different levels of trajectory sparsity, and different train-testing splitting ratios than baselines, yielding an improvement of 31.05% to 94.60%.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Solving Person Re-Identification (Re-Id) through Deep Convolutional Neural Networks is a daunting challenge due to the small size and variety of the training data, especially in Single-Shot Re-Id, where only two images per person are available. The lack of training data causes the overfitting of the deep neural models, leading to degenerated performance.
   This article explores a wide assortment of neural architectures that have been commonly used for object classification and analyzes their suitability in a Re-Id model. These architectures have been trained through a Triplet Model and evaluated over two challenging Single-Shot Re-Id datasets, PRID2011 and CUHK. This comparative study is aimed at obtaining the best-performing architectures and some concluding guidance to optimize the features embedding for the Re-Identification task. The obtained results present Inception-ResNet and DenseNet as potentially useful models, especially when compared with other methods, specifically designed for solving Re-Id.

AB Black-box machine learning models are used in an increasing number of high-stakes domains, and this creates a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI). However, the use of XAI in machine learning introduces privacy risks, which currently remain largely unnoticed. Therefore, we explore the possibility of an explanation linkage attack, which can occur when deploying instance-based strategies to find counterfactual explanations. To counter such an attack, we propose k-anonymous counterfactual explanations and introduce pureness as a metric to evaluate the validity of these k-anonymous counterfactual explanations. Our results show that making the explanations, rather than the whole dataset, k-anonymous, is beneficial for the quality of the explanations.

AB As the rapid-spreading disease COVID-19 occupies the world, most governments adopt strict control policies to alleviate the impact of the virus. These policies successfully reduced the prevalence and delayed the epidemic peak, while they are also associated with high economic and social costs. To bridge the microscopic epidemic transmission patterns and control policies, simulation systems play an important role. In this work, we propose an agent-based disease simulator for indoor public spaces, which contribute to most of the transmission in cities. As an example, we study Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, which is one of the most bustling aviation hubs in China. Specifically, we design a high-efficiency mobility generation module to reconstruct the individual trajectories considering both lingering behavior and crowd mobility, which greatly enhances the credibility of the simulated mobility and ensures real-time performance. Based on the individual trajectories, we propose a multi-path disease transmission module optimized for indoor public spaces, which includes three main transmission paths as close contact transmission, aerosol transmission, and object surface transmission. We design a novel convolution-based algorithm to mimic the diffusion process, which can leverage the high concurrent capability of the graphics processing unit to accelerate the simulation process. Leveraging our simulation paradigm, the effectiveness of common policy interventions can be quantitatively evaluated. For mobility interventions, we find that lingering control is the most effective mobility intervention with 32.35% fewer infections, while increasing social distance and increasing walking speed have a similar effect with 15.15% and 18.02% fewer infections. It demonstrates the importance of introducing crowd mobility into disease transmission simulation. For transmission processes, we find the aerosol transmission involves in 99.99% of transmission, which highlights the importance of ventilation in indoor public spaces. Our simulation also demonstrates that without strict entrance detection to identify the input infections, only performing frequent disinfection cannot achieve desirable epidemic outcomes. Based on our simulation paradigm, we can shed light on better policy designs that achieve a good balance between disease spreading control and social costs.

DE Efficient Sampling; Explicit Interaction; entity recognition; relation
   extraction
AB Joint entity and relation extraction (RE) construct a framework for unifying entity recognition and relationship extraction, and the approach can exploit the dependencies between the two tasks to improve the performance of the task. However, the existing tasks still have the following two problems. First, when the model extracts entity information, the boundary is blurred. Secondly, there are mostly implicit interactions between modules, that is, the interactive information is hidden inside the model, and the implicit interactions are often insufficient in the degree of interaction and lack of interpretability. To this end, this study proposes a joint entity and relation extraction model (ESEI) based on Efficient Sampling and Explicit Interaction. We innovatively divide negative samples into sentences based on whether they overlap with positive samples, which improves the model's ability to extract entity word boundary information by controlling the sampling ratio. In order to increase the explicit interaction ability between the models, we introduce a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) into the model, which will serve as a bridge linking the entity recognition module and the relation extraction module, and enhance the interaction between the modules through information transfer. Our method substantially improves the model's discriminative power on entity extraction tasks and enhances the interaction between relation extraction tasks and entity extraction tasks. Experiments showthat the method is effective, we validate our method on four datasets, and for joint entity and relation extraction, our model improves the F1 score on multiple datasets.

DE Fairness; recommender system; machine learning
ID SYSTEMS; BIAS
AB As one of the most pervasive applications of machine learning, recommender systems are playing an important role on assisting human decision-making. The satisfaction of users and the interests of platforms are closely related to the quality of the generated recommendation results. However, as a highly data-driven system, recommender system could be affected by data or algorithmic bias and thus generate unfair results, which could weaken the reliance of the systems. As a result, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness problems in recommendation settings. Recently, there has been growing attention on fairness considerations in recommender systems with more and more literature on approaches to promote fairness in recommendation. However, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization, thus making it difficult to penetrate for new researchers to the domain. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing works on fairness in recommendation. This survey focuses on the foundations for fairness in recommendation literature. It first presents a brief introduction about fairness in basic machine learning tasks such as classification and ranking to provide a general overview of fairness research, as well as introduce the more complex situations and challenges that need to be considered when studying fairness in recommender systems. After that, the survey will introduce fairness in recommendation with a focus on the taxonomies of current fairness definitions, the typical techniques for improving fairness, as well as the datasets for fairness studies in recommendation. The survey also talks about the challenges and opportunities in fairness research with the hope of promoting the fair recommendation research area and beyond.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB We apply reinforcement learning to video compressive sensing to adapt the compression ratio. Specifically, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which captures high-speed video using a low-speed camera is considered in this work, in which multiple (B) video frames can be reconstructed from a snapshot measurement. One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt B in the video SCI system for different scenes. In this article, we fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). An RL model, as well as various convolutional neural networks for reconstruction, are learned to achieve adaptive sensing of video SCI systems. Furthermore, the performance of an object detection network using directly the video SCI measurements without reconstruction is also used to perform RL-based adaptive video compressive sensing. Our proposed adaptive SCI method can thus be implemented in low cost and real time. Our work takes the technology one step further towards real applications of video SCI.

DE Qrowdsmith: Enhancing paid microtask crowdsourcing with gamification and
   furtherance incentives
ID QUALITY
AB Microtask crowdsourcing platforms are social intelligence systems in which volunteers, called crowdworkers, complete small, repetitive tasks in return for a small fee. Beyond payments, task requesters are considering non-monetary incentives such as points, badges, and other gamified elements to increase performance and improve crowdworker experience. In this article, we present Qrowdsmith, a platform for gamifying microtask crowdsourcing. To design the system, we explore empirically a range of gamified and financial incentives and analyse their impact on howefficient, effective, and reliable the results are. To maintain participation over time and save costs, we propose furtherance incentives, which are offered to crowdworkers to encourage additional contributions in addition to the fee agreed upfront. In a series of controlled experiments, we find that while gamification can work as furtherance incentives, it impacts negatively on crowdworkers' performance, both in terms of the quantity and quality of work, as compared to a baseline where they can continue to contribute voluntarily. Gamified incentives are also less effective than paid bonus equivalents. Our results contribute to the understanding of how best to encourage engagement in microtask crowdsourcing activities and design better crowd intelligence systems.

ID PERSUASION
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly deployed in practical applications. However, there is a major concern whether AI systems will be trusted by humans. To establish trust in AI systems, there is a need for users to understand the reasoning behind their solutions. Therefore, systems should be able to explain and justify their output. Explainable AI Planning is a field that involves explaining the outputs, i.e., solution plans produced by AI planning systems to a user. The main goal of a plan explanation is to help humans understand reasoning behind the plans that are produced by the planners. In this article, we propose an argument scheme-based approach to provide explanations in the domain of AI planning. We present novel argument schemes to create arguments that explain a plan and its key elements and a set of critical questions that allow interaction between the arguments and enable the user to obtain further information regarding the key elements of the plan. Furthermore, we present a novel dialogue system using the argument schemes and critical questions for providing interactive dialectical explanations.

ID CORPUS
AB Recent years have seen an exponential growth (+98% in 2022 w.r.t. the previous year) of the number of research articles in the few-shot learning field, which aims at training machine learning models with extremely limited available data. The research interest toward few-shot learning systems for Named Entity Recognition (NER) is thus at the same time increasing. NER consists in identifying mentions of pre-defined entities from unstructured text, and serves as a fundamental step in many downstream tasks, such as the construction of Knowledge Graphs, or Question Answering. The need for a NER system able to be trainedwith few-annotated examples comes in all its urgency in domains where the annotation process requires time, knowledge and expertise (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal), and in low-resource languages. In this survey, starting from a clear definition and description of the few-shot NER (FS-NER) problem, we take stock of the current state-of-the-art and propose a taxonomy which divides algorithms in two macro-categories according to the underlying mechanisms: model-centric and data-centric. For each category, we line-up works as a story to show how the field is moving toward new research directions. Eventually, techniques, limitations, and key aspects are deeply analyzed to facilitate future studies.

   nearest neighbors; recommender systems; privacy risk; popularity bias
AB User-based KNN recommender systems (UserKNN) utilize the rating data of a target user's k nearest neighbors in the recommendation process. This, however, increases the privacy risk of the neighbors, since the recommendations could expose the neighbors' rating data to other users or malicious parties. To reduce this risk, existing work applies differential privacy by adding randomness to the neighbors' ratings, which unfortunately reduces the accuracy of UserKNN. In this work, we introduce ReuseKNN, a novel differentially private KNN-based recommender system. The main idea is to identify small but highly reusable neighborhoods so that (i) only a minimal set of users requires protection with differential privacy and (ii) most users do not need to be protected with differential privacy since they are only rarely exploited as neighbors. In our experiments on five diverse datasets, we make two key observations. Firstly, ReuseKNN requires significantly smaller neighborhoods and, thus, fewer neighbors need to be protected with differential privacy compared with traditional UserKNN. Secondly, despite the small neighborhoods, ReuseKNN outperforms UserKNN and a fully differentially private approach in terms of accuracy. Overall, ReuseKNN leads to significantly less privacy risk for users than in the case of UserKNN.

AB Traffic congestion incurs long delay in travel time, which seriously affects our daily travel experiences. Exploring why traffic congestion occurs is significantly important to effectively address the problem of traffic congestion and improve user experience. Traditional approaches to mine the congestion causes depend on human efforts, which is time consuming and cost-intensive. Hence, we aim at discovering the known and unknown causes of traffic congestion in a systematic way. However, to achieve it, there are three challenges: (1) traffic congestion is affected by several factors with complex spatio-temporal relations; (2) there are a few samples of congestion data with known causes due to the limitation of human label; (3) more unknown congestion causes are unexplored since several factors contribute to traffic congestion. To address above challenges, we design a congestion cause discovery system consisting of two modules: (1) congestion feature extraction module, which extracts the important features distinguishing between different causes of congestion; and (2) congestion cause discovery module, which designs a deep semi-supervised learning based framework to discover the causes of traffic congestion with limited labeled data. Specifically, in pre-training stage, it first leverages a few labeled data as prior knowledge to pre-train the model. Then, in clustering stage, we propose two different clustering methods to discover the congestion causes. For the first clustering method, we extend the classic deep embedded clustering model to produce clusters via soft assignment. For the second one, we iteratively use k-means to group the latent features extracted from the pre-trained model, and use the cluster results as pseudo-labels to fine-tune the network. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our methods is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed cause discovery system. Additionally, our system is deployed and used in the practical production environment at Amap.

TI Causal Feature Selection in the Presence of Sample Selection Bias

DT Article
DE Causal feature selection; sample selection bias; causal effect
ID EFFICIENT
AB Almost all existing causal feature selection methods are proposed without considering the problem of sample selection bias. However, in practice, as data-gathering process cannot be fully controlled, sample selection bias often occurs, leading to spurious correlations between features and the class variable, which seriously deteriorates the performance of those existing methods. In this article, we study the problem of causal feature selection under sample selection bias and propose a novel Progressive Causal Feature Selection (PCFS) algorithm which has three phases. First, PCFS learns the sample weights to balance the treated group and control group distributions corresponding to each feature for removing spurious correlations. Second, based on the sample weights, PCFS uses a weighted cross-entropymodel to estimate the causal effect of each feature and removes some irrelevant features from the confounder set. Third, PCFS progressively repeats the first two phases to remove more irrelevant features and finally obtains a causal feature set. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, the experiments have validated the effectiveness of PCFS, in comparison with several state-of-the-art classical and causal feature selection methods.

AB Obfuscating a dataset by adding random noises to protect the privacy of sensitive samples in the training dataset is crucial to prevent data leakage to untrusted parties when dataset sharing is essential. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate how the dataset obfuscation can affect the resultant model weights -in terms of the model accuracy, similar to 2- distance-based model distance, and level of data privacy-and discuss the potential applications with the proposed Privacy, Utility, and Distinguishability (PUD)-triangle diagram to visualize the requirement preferences. Our experiments are based on the popular MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings. Significant results include a tradeoff between the model accuracy and privacy level and a tradeoff between the model difference and privacy level. The results indicate broad application prospects for training outsourcing and guarding against attacks in federated learning both of which have been increasingly attractive in many areas, particularly learning in edge computing.

AB Static scheduling of computational workflow represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important problem in many areas of computer science. The main idea and novelty of the proposed algorithm is an adaptive heuristic or graph metric that uses a different heuristic rule at each scheduling step depending on local workflow. It is also important to note that multi-agent reinforcement learning is used to determine scheduling policy based on adaptive metrics. To prove the efficiency of the approach, a comparison with the state-of-the-art DAG scheduling algorithms is provided: DONF, CPOP, HCPT, HPS, and PETS. Based on the simulation results, the proposed algorithm shows an improvement of up to 30% on specific graph topologies and an average performance gain of 5.32%, compared to the best scheduling algorithm, DONF (suitable for large-scale scheduling), on a large number of random DAGs. Another important result is that using the proposed algorithm it was possible to cover 30.01% of the proximity interval from the best scheduling algorithm to the global optimal solution. This indicates that the idea of an adaptive metric for DAG scheduling is important and requires further research and development.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Graph neural network; explainable AI; machine learning
AB Uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs) has received increasing attention over recent years. Instance-level GNN explanation aims to discover critical input elements, such as nodes or edges, that the target GNN relies upon for making predictions. Though various algorithms are proposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph, which can preserve original predictions. However, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in this framework: Several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as the original graphs. Consequently, they have the danger of providing spurious explanations and failing to provide consistent explanations. Applying them to explain weakly performed GNNs would further amplify these issues. To address this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of GNNs from the causality perspective. Two typical reasons for spurious explanations are identified: confounding effect of latent variables like distribution shift and causal factors distinct from the original input. Observing that both confounding effects and diverse causal rationales are encoded in internal representations, we propose a new explanation framework with an auxiliary alignment loss, which is theoretically proven to be optimizing a more faithful explanation objective intrinsically. Concretely for this alignment loss, a set of different perspectives are explored: anchor-based alignment, distributional alignment based on Gaussian mixture models, mutual-information-based alignment, and so on. A comprehensive study is conducted both on the effectiveness of this new framework in terms of explanation faithfulness/consistency and on the advantages of these variants.

AB Unsupervised graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional node embeddings without supervision while preserving graph topological structures and node attributive features. Previous Graph Neural Networks (GNN) require a large number of labeled nodes, which may not be accessible in real-world applications. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised graph neural network model with Cluster-aware Self-training and Refining (CLEAR). Specifically, in the proposed CLEAR model, we perform clustering on the node embeddings and update the model parameters by predicting the cluster assignments. To avoid degenerate solutions of clustering, we formulate the graph clustering problem as an optimal transport problem and leverage a balanced clustering strategy. Moreover, we observe that graphs often contain inter-class edges, which mislead the GNN model to aggregate noisy information from neighborhood nodes. Therefore, we propose to refine the graph topology by strengthening intra-class edges and reducing node connections between different classes based on cluster labels, which better preserves cluster structures in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark tasks using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model over baseline methods. Notably, our model gains over 7% improvements in terms of accuracy on node clustering over state-of-the-arts.

   selfattention
AB The development of speech synthesis technology has increased the attention toward the threat of spoofed speech. Although various high-performance spoofing countermeasures have been proposed in recent years, a particular scenario is overlooked: partially spoofed audio, where spoofed utterances may contain both spoofed and bona fide segments. Currently, the research on partially spoofed speech detection is lacking. The existing methods either train with partially spoofed speech at utterance level, resulting in gradient conflicting at the segment level, or directly train with segment level data, which requires segment labels that are difficult to obtain in practice. In this study, to better detect partially spoofed speech when only utterance labels are available, we formulate partially spoofed speech detection into a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. The typical MIL uses a pooling layer to fuse patch scores as a whole, and we propose a hybrid MIL (H-MIL) framework based on max and log-sum-exp pooling methods, which can learn better segment representations to improve partially spoofed speech detection performance. Theoretical and experimental verification shows that H-MIL can effectively relieve the gradient conflicting and gradient vanishing problems. In addition, we analyze the local correlations between segments and introduce a local self-attention mechanism to enhance segment features, which further promotes the detection performance.
   In our experiments, we provide not only detection results at the segment and utterance levels but also some detailed visualization analysis, including the effect of spoof ratio and cross-dataset detection. The experimental results demonstrate the effective detection performance of our method at both the utterance and segment levels, especially when dealing with low spoof ratio attacks. The results confirm that our approach can better deal with partially spoofed speech detection than previous methods.

AB With the constantly generation of process data in industries, process knowledge reuse and learning from process dataset has shown promising potential in machining process planning. However, existing methods cannot effectively extract different granularity process intents, and thus the process data cannot be effectively utilized. In this paper, an effective process design intent inference method of process data via integrating deep learning and grammar parsing is proposed. First, based on the projection of cutter location segments, an association approach between machining operations and machining features is proposed to extract the process intent of each machining operation. Then, a deep learning based working step process intent sequence decision-making model is proposed to estimate the probability distributions of alternative working step process intents at each time. Moreover, according to the working step process intent sequences of existing parts in an industry, the process knowledge And-Or graph (PK-AOG) is constructed by introducing the probabilistic grammar graph model. Finally, the optimal process intents of each working step are jointly obtained based on grammar parsing by taking the PK-AOG as a guide. In the experiments, the effectiveness of our approach is validated by developing a prototype system, and the results show that our approach is practical in process intents extraction.

AB Stochastic Programming is a powerful framework that addresses decision-making under uncertainties, which is a frequent occurrence in real-world problems. To effectively solve Stochastic Programming problems, scenario generation is one of the common practices that organizes realizations of stochastic processes with finite discrete distributions, which enables the use of mathematical programming models of the original problem. The quality of solutions is significantly influenced by the scenarios employed, necessitating a delicate balance between incorporating informative scenarios and preventing overfitting. Distributions-based scenario generation methodologies have been extensively studied over time, while a relatively recent concept of problem-driven scenario generation has emerged, aiming to incorporate the underlying problem's structure during the scenario generation process. This survey explores recent literature on problem-driven scenario generation algorithms and methodologies. The investigation aims to identify circumstances under which this approach is effective and efficient. The work provides a comprehensive categorization of existing literature, supplemented by illustrative examples. Additionally, the survey examines potential applications and discusses avenues for its integration with machine learning technologies. By shedding light on the effectiveness of problem-driven scenario generation and its potential for synergistic integration with machine learning, this survey contributes to enhanced decision-making strategies in the context of uncertainties.

AB In streaming data applications, the incoming samples are processed and discarded, and therefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of lifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which the samples arrive may heavily affect the performance of incremental learners. The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide valuable aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use case has been cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been recently integrated in a streaming clustering method. In this context, the work presented, here, introduces the first adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and semi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows how to use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based match tracking mechanism. The model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects by integrating an online iCVI module as module B of a topological ART predictive mapping (TopoARTMAP)-thereby being named iCVI-TopoARTMAP-and using iCVI-driven post-processing heuristics at the end of each learning step. The online iCVI module provides assignments of input samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of the several iCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP maintains useful properties shared by the ART predictive mapping (ARTMAP) models, such as stability, immunity to catastrophic forgetting, and the many-to-one mapping capability via the map field module. The performance and robustness to the presentation order of iCVI-TopoARTMAP were evaluated via experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets.

AB Data production has followed an increased growth in the last years, to the point that traditional or batch machine-learning (ML) algorithms cannot cope with the sheer volume of generated data. Stream or online ML presents itself as a viable solution to deal with the dynamic nature of streaming data. Besides coping with the inherent challenges of streaming data, online ML solutions must be accurate, fast, and bear a reduced memory footprint. We propose a new decision tree-based ensemble algorithm for online ML regression named online extra trees (OXT). Our proposal takes inspiration from the batch learning extra trees (XT) algorithm, a popular and faster alternative to random forest (RF). While speed and memory costs might not be a central concern in most batch applications, they become crucial in data stream data learning. Our proposal combines subbagging (sampling without replacement), random tree split points, and model trees to deliver competitive prediction errors and reduced computational costs. Throughout an extensive experimental evaluation comprising 22 real-world and synthetic datasets, we compare OXT against the state-of-the-art adaptive RF (ARF) and other incremental regressors. OXT is generally more accurate than its competitors while running significantly faster than ARF and expending significantly less memory.

AB Streaming data mining can be applied in many practical applications, such as social media, market analysis, and sensor networks. Most previous efforts assume that all training instances except for the novel class have been completely labeled for novel class detection in streaming data. However, a more realistic situation is that only a few instances in the data stream are labeled. In addition, most existing algorithms are potentially dependent on the strong cohesion between known classes or the greater separation between novel class and known classes in the feature space. Unfortunately, this potential dependence is usually not an inherent characteristic of streaming data. Therefore, to classify data streams and detect novel classes, the proposed algorithm should satisfy: 1) it can handle any degree of separation between novel class and known classes (both easy and difficult novel class detection) and 2) it can use limited labeled instances to build algorithm models. In this article, we tackle these issues by a new framework called semisupervised streaming learning for difficult novel class detection (SSLDN), which consists of three major components: an effective novel class detector based on random trees, a classifier by using the information of nearest neighbors, and an efficient updating process. Empirical studies on several datasets validate that SSLDN can accurately handle different degrees of separation between the novel and known classes in semisupervised streaming data.

TI Uncertainty Estimation With Neural Processes for Meta-Continual Learning

DE Continual learning; COVID forecast; evolving data streams;
   meta-learning; neural processes (NPs); uncertainty estimation
AB The ability to evaluate uncertainties in evolving data streams has become equally, if not more, crucial than building a static predictor. For instance, during the pandemic, a model should consider possible uncertainties such as governmental policies, meteorological features, and vaccination schedules. Neural process families (NPFs) have recently shone a light on predicting such uncertainties by bridging Gaussian processes (GPs) and neural networks (NNs). Their abilities to output average predictions and the acceptable variances, i.e., uncertainties, made them suitable for predictions with insufficient data, such as meta-learning or few-shot learning. However, existing models have not addressed continual learning which imposes a stricter constraint on the data access. Regarding this, we introduce a member meta-continual learning with neural process (MCLNP) for uncertainty estimation. We enable two levels of uncertainty estimations: the local uncertainty on certain points and the global uncertainty p(z) that represents the function evolution in dynamic environments. To facilitate continual learning, we hypothesize that the previous knowledge can be applied to the current task, hence adopt a coreset as a memory buffer to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. The relationships between the degree of global uncertainties with the intratask diversity and model complexity are discussed. We have estimated prediction uncertainties with multiple evolving types including abrupt/gradual/recurrent shifts. The applications encompass meta-continual learning in the 1-D, 2-D datasets, and a novel spatial-temporal COVID dataset. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines on the likelihood and can rebound quickly even for heavily evolved data streams.

AB Nowadays, due to the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in software systems, development teams face the challenge of working together to integrate tasks, resources, and roles in a new field, named AI Engineering. Proposals, in the way of models, highlight the needs of integrating two different perspectives - the software and the decision-making support (big data, machine learning, and so on) systems. But there is something more - both systems must achieve high quality levels for different properties; and this is not a straightforward task. Quality properties, such as reusability, traditionally evaluated and reinforced through modeling in software systems, do not exactly apply similarly in decision-making support systems. In this paper, we propose a model for managing reusable assets in AI engineered systems by linking software product line modeling and variety identification. The proposal is exemplified through a case study in the agriculture domain.

AB The conjunctive normal form (CNF) algorithm is one of the best known and most widely used algorithms in classical logic and its applications. In its algebraic approach, it makes use in a loop of a certain well-defined operation related to the "distributivity" of logical disjunction versus conjunction. For those types of implementations, the loop iteration runs a comparison between formulas to decide when to stop. In this article, we explain how to pre-calculate the exact number of loop iterations, thus avoiding the work involved in the above-mentioned comparison. After that, it is possible to concatenate another loop focused now on the "associativity" of conjunction and disjunction. Also for that loop, we explain how to calculate the optimal number of rounds, so that the decisional comparison phase for stopping can be also avoided.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning have input pixel limitations, which leads to lost information regarding microcalcification when mammography images are compressed. Segmenting images into patches retains the original resolution when inputting them into the CNN and allows for identifying the location of calcification. This study aimed to develop a mammographic calcification detection method using deep learning by classifying the presence of calcification in the breast. Using publicly available data, 212 mammograms from 81 women were segmented into 224 x 224-pixel patches, producing 15,049 patches. These were visually classified for calcification and divided into five subsets for training and evaluation using fivefold cross-validation, ensuring image consistency. ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101 were used for training, each of which created a two-class calcification classifier. The ResNet18 classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 96.0%, mammogram accuracy of 95.8%, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, and a processing time of 0.07 s. The results of ResNet50 indicated 96.4% overall accuracy, 96.3% mammogram accuracy, an AUC of 0.96, and a processing time of 0.14 s. The results of ResNet101 indicated 96.3% overall accuracy, 96.1% mammogram accuracy, an AUC of 0.96, and a processing time of 0.20 s. This developed method offers quick, accurate calcification classification and efficient visualization of calcification locations.

AB Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction as the key technique of prognostics and health management (PHM) has been extensively investigated. The application of data-driven methods in RUL prediction has advanced greatly in recent years. However, a large number of model parameters, low prediction accuracy, and lack of interpretability of prediction results are common problems of current data-driven methods. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with Self-Attention mechanism-based hybrid framework for aircraft engine RUL prognostics. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism is employed to learn the dif-ferences and interactions between features, and reasonably map high-dimensional features to low-dimensional spaces. Subsequently, PINN is utilized to regularize the end-to-end prediction network, which maps features to RUL. The RUL prediction framework termed AttnPINN has verified its superiority on the Commercial Modular AeroPropulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with a small number of parameters, resulting in computation-light features. Furthermore, its prediction results are highly interpretable and can accurately predict failure modes, thereby enabling precise predictive maintenance.

ID EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; ENVIRONMENTS; SEARCH
AB Multi-objective optimisation (MOO) is a popular approach for finding solutions to many types of complex problems with large search spaces and conflicting search objectives. In the past, MOO algorithms have been shown to reliably produce good optimisation results. With the rise of cyber- physical systems, however, emerges the new challenge of non-deterministic system executions, caused by e.g. imperfect sensor readings or synchronisation in multi-process/multi-agent system architectures. These systems produce varying output on each execution, causing the algorithms' observations to be noisy. Naturally, MOO algorithms favour the fittest solutions, which may have been measured with great inaccuracy. The end results are therefore not trustworthy. In this paper, we propose kNN-averaging, a new method to address this issue by identifying the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) of a solution, and using their weighted average as an estimate for its true fitness. Our experiments demonstrate the viability of kNN-averaging on 40 synthetic benchmark problems and on a real-world case study system. In the process, we compare kNN-averaging to the noisy baseline as well as two resampling-based methods and one spectral sampling approach on a range of algorithm settings. The results show that kNN-averaging approximates the fitness of solutions more accurately than the noisy baseline, leading to more trustworthy results. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Relational cues are extracts from actual verbal dialogues that help build the therapist-patient working alliance and stronger bond through the depiction of empathy, respect and openness. ECAs (Embodied conversational agents) are human-like virtual agents that exhibit verbal and non-verbal behaviours. In the digital health space, ECAs act as health coaches or experts. ECA dialogues have previously been designed to include relational cues to motivate patients to change their current behaviours and encourage adherence to a treatment plan. However, there is little understanding of who finds specific relational cues delivered by an ECA helpful or not. Drawing the literature together, we have categorised relational cues into empowering, working alliance, affirmative and social dialogue. In this study, we have embedded the dialogue of Alex, an ECA, to encourage healthy behaviours with all the relational cues (empathic Alex) or with none of the relational cues (neutral Alex). A total of 206 participants were randomly assigned to interact with either empathic or neutral Alex and were also asked to rate the helpfulness of selected relational cues. We explore if the perceived helpfulness of the relational cues is a good predictor of users' intention to change the recommended health behaviours and/or development of a working alliance. Our models also investigate the impact of individual factors, including gender, age, culture and personality traits of the users. The idea is to establish whether a certain group of individuals having similarities in terms of individual factors found a particular cue or group of cues helpful. This will establish future versions of Alex and allow Alex to tailor its dialogue to specific groups, as well as help in building ECAs with multiple personalities and roles.

ID MEMBRANE FUEL-CELL
AB As a high efficiency hydrogen-to-power device, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) attracts much attention, especially for the automotive applications. Real-time prediction of output voltage and area specific resistance (ASR) via the on-board model is critical to monitor the health state of the automotive PEMFC stack. In this study, we use a transient PEMFC system model for dynamic process simulation of PEMFC to generate the dataset, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model is developed to predict the dynamic performance of PEMFC. The results show that the developed LSTM deep learning model has much better performance than other models. A sensitivity analysis on the input features is performed, and three insensitive features are removed, that could slightly improve the prediction accuracy and significantly reduce the data volume. The neural structure, sequence duration, and sampling frequency are optimized. We find that the optimal sequence data duration for predicting ASR is 5 s or 20 s, and that for predicting output voltage is 40 s. The sampling frequency can be reduced from 10 Hz to 0.5 Hz and 0.25 Hz, which slightly affects the prediction accuracy, but obviously reduces the data volume and computation amount.

DE Contrastive Classifier Network (CCN); Domain-specific Learning (DSLN);
   Category and Domain Features Augmentation (CDFA); Domain Adaptation (DA)
AB Domain adaptation (DA) aims to reduce knowledge gap between domains and improve the prediction ability of models in the target domain. However, the representations learned from feature extraction network often contain redundant information, which is harmful to domain alignment. In addition, many methods only focus on either single-source DA task or multi-source DA task, which limits their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method called Category and Domain Features Augmentation (CDFA), which consists of two components: Contrastive Classifier Network (CCN) and Domain-specific Learning Network (DSLN). CDFA can remove the specific representation at the feature extraction stage to alleviate transfer difficulty, where CCN is used to increase the probabilistic output of samples and avoid misclassification, and DSLN facilitates the separation of redundant information from all representations by learning domain -specific representations. Empirical evaluations on several cross-domain benchmarks under single-source and multi-source DA scenarios illustrate the competitive performance of CDFA with respect to the state-of-the-art.

DE Autoencoder; Timeseries; Train-set size; Energy systems; CHP
AB In the latest years, deep learning has been massively used to face problems that have not been solved by means of classical approaches. In particular, an autoencoder is a popular unsupervised artificial neural network that learns efficient data representations (encoding) by training the network to ignore features with a small content of information. Even though autoencoders over-perform classical techniques in several applications like anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, features denoising, and missing values imputation, the literature does not provide a commonly accepted methodology to define the optimal amount of data needed to train the model. This paper proposes a procedure to determine the optimal train-set size to minimize the reconstruction error of an autoencoder with pre-defined structure and hyper-parameters that will be trained to encode the normal behavior of energy generation systems. This procedure exploits the outcome of learning curves, a powerful tool to track algorithms performance while the train-set dimension varies. Afterward, the procedure is applied to three real case studies where two types of autoencoders are trained to learn the normal behavior of a YANMAR combined heat and power unit with the scope of detecting incoming anomalies. In the end, the outcomes of the procedure are explained and, under the constraint of a daily retraining frequency, 6 weeks are identified as the optimal train-set size for both autoencoders.

AB Night flow analysis is predominantly used to identify incipient (gradual) leakages in real-life Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). However, due to extreme stochastic demand especially in residentially dominated district metering areas (DMAs) and the emergence of sleepless cities, traditional night flow analysis methods have become inefficient. This study proposes a semi-supervised sequence-to-sequence Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep Auto Encoder (AE) method for night flow analysis in WDNs. To enhance the generalisation power of the deep AE, a vigorous data augmentation procedure based engineering domain knowledge and inherent properties of DMA is presented. The proposed method learns the underlying benign patterns in night flow (2:00 am to 4:00 am) and identifies significant deviations that represent the development of incipient leakages. The method was validated on residential, commercial, and industrial DMAs in a real-life WDN in the angstrom lesund Municipality of Norway. The results from the study showed that the proposed method is a robust and superior alternative to traditional night flow under extreme stochastic consumer demand. The proposed BiLSTM deep AE method was able to identify unreported leakages in the DMAs within 1 day or at most 4 days compared with at least 15 days identification time by traditional minimum night flow (MNF) and average night flow (ANF) analyses. Additionally, traditional minimum night flow analysis also produced more false positives compared with the proposed method. The results also revealed the usage of point estimates to represent night flow as done in MNF and ANF analyses fail to capture all salient information regarding night flow compared to the BiLSTM deep AE.

AB The prediction of significant wave height (SWH) is crucial for managing wave energy. While many machine learning studies have focused on accurately predicting SWH values within hours in advance, the primary concern should be given to the level of the wave height for real-world applications. In this paper, a classification framework for the time-series of SWH based on Transformer encoder (TF) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is developed, which can provide a lead time of 6 to 48 h with the fixed thresholds of 2 m for high level waves and 1.5 m for low level waves. The performance of this approach is compared to that of three mainstream algorithms with and without EMD features. Results from the datasets collected from buoy measurements in the Atlantic Ocean indicate that the optimal mean accuracy at a lead time of 6 h was 99.1% and the average training time was 75 s, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of this proposed model. This study provides valuable tools and references for real-world SWH prediction applications.

AB Clustering approaches are one of the probabilistic load flow (PLF) methods in distribution networks that can be used to obtain output random variables, with much less computation burden and time than the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. However, a challenge of the clustering methods is that the statistical characteristics of the output random variables are obtained with low accuracy. This paper presents a hybrid approach based on clustering and Point estimate methods. In the proposed approach, first, the sample points are clustered based on the k-means method and the optimal agent of each cluster is determined. Then, for each member of the population of agents, the deterministic load flow calculations are performed, and the output variables are calculated. Afterward, a Point estimate-based PLF is performed and the mean and the standard deviation of the output variables are obtained. Finally, the statistical data of each output random variable are modified using the Point estimate method. The use of the proposed method makes it possible to obtain the statistical properties of output random variables such as mean, standard deviation and probabilistic functions, with high accuracy and without significantly increasing the burden of calculations. In order to confirm the consistency and efficiency of the proposed method, the 10-, 33-, 69-, 85-, and 118-bus standard distribution networks have been simulated using coding in Python (R) programming language. In simulation studies, the results of the proposed method have been compared with the results obtained from the clustering method as well as the MCS method, as a criterion.

AB Monocular endoscopic 6-DoF camera tracking plays a vital role in surgical navigation that involves multimodal images to build augmented or virtual reality surgery. Such a 6-DoF camera tracking generally can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. To resolve this nonlinear problem, this work proposes a new pipeline of constrained evolutionary stochastic filtering that originally introduces spatial constraints and evolutionary stochastic diffusion to deal with particle degeneracy and impoverishment in current stochastic filtering methods. With its application to endoscope 6-DoF tracking and validation on clinical data including more than 59,000 endoscopic video frames acquired from various surgical procedures, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new pipeline that works much better than state-of-the-art tracking methods. In particular, it can significantly improve the accuracy of current monocular endoscope tracking approaches from (4.83 mm, 10.2 degrees) to (2.78 mm, 7.44 degrees).

ID CENTRALITY
AB This research pursues the question of how the computer-generated analysis and visualization of communication can foster collaboration in teams that work together online. The audio data of regular online video meetings of three different teams were analyzed. Structural information regarding their communication was visualized in a communication report, and then, discussed with the teams in so-called digitally supported coaching (DSC) sessions. The aim of the DSC is to improve team collaboration by discerning helpful and less helpful patterns in the teams' communication. This report allows us to recognize individual positions within the teams, as well as communication structures, such as conversational turn taking, that are relevant for group intelligence, as other research has shown. The findings pertaining to the team members during the DSC were gathered via questionnaires. These qualitative data were then matched with the quantitative data derived from the calls, particularly social network analysis (SNA). The SNA was inferred using the average number of interactions between the participants as measured in the calls. The qualitative findings of the teams were then cross-checked with the quantitative analysis. As a result, the assessment of team members' roles was highly coherent with the SNA. Furthermore, all teams managed to derive concrete measures for improving their collaboration based on the reflection in the DSC.

ID SYSTEMS; UNITS
AB Wind energy has been increasingly adopted to mitigate climate change. However, the variability of wind energy causes wind curtailment, resulting in considerable economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind curtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly weaken the economic potential of BESS in energy trading. Ideal BESS scheduling should balance onsite wind curtailment reduction and market bidding, but practical implementation is challenging due to coordination complexity and the stochastic nature of energy prices and wind generation. We investigate the joint-market bidding strategy of a co-located wind-battery system in the spot and Regulation Frequency Control Ancillary Service markets. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based approach that decouples the system's market participation into two related Markov decision processes for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind curtailment while performing joint-market bidding to maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we validated the coordinated bidding strategy, with outcomes surpassing the optimization-based benchmark in terms of higher revenue by approximately 25% and more wind curtailment reduction by 2.3 times. Our results show that joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance of wind-battery systems compared to participating in each market separately. Simulations also show that using curtailed wind generation as a power source for charging the BESS can lead to additional financial gains. The successful implementation of our algorithm would encourage co-location of generation and storage assets to unlock wider system benefits.

AB Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) is an example of a chemistry tabulation or a flamelet method that is under attention because of its accuracy and speed in predicting combustion characteristics. However, the main problem in applying the model is a large amount of memory required. One way to solve this problem is to apply machine learning (ML) to replace the stored tabulated data. Four different machine learning methods, including two Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a Random Forest (RF), and a Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), are trained, validated, and compared in terms of various performance measures. The progress variable source term and transport properties are replaced with the ML models. Particular attention was paid to the progress variable source term due to its high gradient and wide range of its value in the control variables space. Data preprocessing is shown to play an essential role in improving the performance of the models. Two ensemble models, namely RF and GBT, exhibit high training efficiency and acceptable accuracy. On the other hand, the ANN models have lower training errors and take longer to train. The four models are then combined with a one-dimensional combustion code to simulate a counterflow non-premixed diffusion flame in engine-relevant conditions. The predictions of the ML-FGM models are compared with detailed chemical simulations and the original FGM model for key combustion properties and representative species profiles.

AB In the last two decades, motor operation monitoring tools have become a necessity, and many studies focus on the detection and diagnosis of motor electrical faults. However, at present, a core obstacle that prevents the direct comparison of such classification techniques is the lack of a standard database that can be used as a benchmark. In view of this, we offer here a public experimental data-set that has beendesigned specifically for the comparison of synchronous motor electrical fault classifiers. The data-set comprises five types of motor electrical faults: open phase between inverter and motor; short circuit/leakage current between two phases; short circuit/leakage current in phase-to-neutral; rotor excitation voltage disconnection; and variation of rotor excitation current. In addition, each fault has been recorded as a four-dimensional signal: three phase voltages; three phase currents; motor speed; and motor current. The package includes two deep-learning reference classifiers that are based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM). Due

DE dimension reduction; feature selection; text classification
ID INFORMATION GAIN; SCHEME
AB Text classification (TC) is a very crucial task in this century of high-volume text datasets. Feature selection (FS) is one of the most important stages in TC studies. In the literature, numerous feature selection methods are recommended for TC. In the TC domain, filter-based FS methods are commonly utilized to select a more informative feature subsets. Each method uses a scoring system that is based on its algorithm to order the features. The classification process is then carried out by choosing the top-N features. However, each method's feature order is distinct from the others. Each method selects by giving the qualities that are critical to its algorithm a high score, but it does not select by giving the features that are unimportant a low value. In this paper, we proposed a novel filter-based FS method namely, brilliant probabilistic feature selector (BPFS), to assign a fair score and select informative features. While the BPFS method selects unique features, it also aims to select sparse features by assigning higher scores than common features. Extensive experimental studies using three effective classifiers decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and multinomial naive bayes (MNB) on four widely used datasets named Reuters-21,578, 20Newsgroup, Enron1, and Polarity with different characteristics demonstrate the success of the BPFS method. For feature dimensions, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 dimensions were used. The experimental results on different benchmark datasets show that the BPFS method is more successful than the well-known and recent FS methods according to Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 scores.

We show that the process of improving references can be tackled with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) powered by an information retrieval system and a language model. This neural-network-based system, which we call SIDE, can identify Wikipedia citations that are unlikely to support their claims, and subsequently recommend better ones from the web. We train this model on existing Wikipedia references, therefore learning from the contributions and combined wisdom of thousands of Wikipedia editors. Using crowdsourcing, we observe that for the top 10% most likely citations to be tagged as unverifiable by our system, humans prefer our system's suggested alternatives compared with the originally cited reference 70% of the time. To validate the applicability of our system, we built a demo to engage with the English-speaking Wikipedia community and find that SIDE's first citation recommendation is preferred twice as often as the existing Wikipedia citation for the same top 10% most likely unverifiable claims according to SIDE. Our results indicate that an AI-based system could be used, in tandem with humans, to improve the verifiability of Wikipedia.

AB Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will play a vital role in forthcoming military conflicts. Effectively avoiding threats and improving the survivability of fixed-wing UAV in dynamic hostile environments are the keys to the success of combat missions. Hence, endowing fixed-wing UAVs with the ability to autonomously generate evasive maneuver is the primary problem that should be solved. With considering the threat of air-to-air missile attacks, this paper designs a novel hierarchical goal-guided learning (HGGL) method, which combines with traditional off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and endows the agent with the ability to evade a series of air-to-air missiles. The pivotal idea of the proposed algorithm is to use the hierarchical features of the goal, it improves the availability of training data to eliminate the limitation of the convergence rate of traditional DRL algorithms owing to sparse rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in several simulation experiments. All experiments are applied on the XSimStudio platform. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed and outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional algorithms.

DT Article
DE Safe feedback motion planning; Collision avoidance; Instantaneous local
   control barrier function; Goal-driven control lyapunov function
AB Mobile robots are desired with resilience to safely interact with prior-unknown environments and finally accomplish given tasks. This paper utilizes instantaneous local sensory data to stimulate the safe feedback motion planning (SFMP) strategy with adaptability to diverse prior-unknown environments without building a global map. This is achieved by the numerical optimization with the constraints, referred to as instantaneous local control barrier functions (IL-CBFs) and goal-driven control Lyapunov functions (GD-CLFs), learned from perceptional signals. In particular, the IL-CBFs reflecting potential collisions and GD-CLFs encoding incrementally discovered subgoals are first online learned from local perceptual data. Then, the learned IL-CBFs are united with GD-CLFs in the context of quadratic programming (QP) to generate the safe feedback motion planning strategy. Rather importantly, an optimization over the admissible control space of IL-CBFs is conducted to enhance the solution feasibility of QP. The SFMP strategy is developed with theoretically guaranteed collision avoidance and convergence to destinations. Numerical simulations are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed SFMP strategy that drives mobile robots to safely reach the destination incrementally in diverse prior-unknown environments.

AB Intelligent systems and human-machine interactions have consistently provided convenience in both work and daily life. Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) can assist humans in artistic creation by generating painting images based on textual descriptions. However, the quality of generated painting images depends heavily on well-designed prompts, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming in painting creation. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive performance in linguistic tasks such as question answering and logical inference, demonstrating strong linguistic intelligence. This paper proposes an assistant painting creation approach to provide precise content control for painting generation by combining LLMs with text-to-image generative models and evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on painting content generation and painting element arrangement. The experimental results show that our approach can provide clear guidance on rich painting content and reasonable arrangements of painting elements, demonstrating its ability of text-based painting scene imagination. In painting generation tasks, LLMs like ChatGPT can help the text-to-image models with precise control over the painting content and improve the overall painting results.

ID TIME; TRANSITIONS; BRAKING; IMPACT
AB Existing research on control-transitions from automated driving (AD) to manual driving mainly stems from studies in virtual settings. There is a need for studies conducted in real settings to better understand the impacts of increasing vehicle automation on traffic safety. This study aims specifically to understand how drivers respond to take-over requests (TORs) in real traffic by investigating the associations between 1) where drivers look when receiving the TOR, 2) repeated exposure to TORs, and 3) the drivers' response process. In total, thirty participants were exposed to four TORs after about 5-6 min of driving with AD on public roads. While in AD, participants could choose to engage in nondriving-related tasks (NDRTs). When they received the TOR, for 38% of TORs, participants were already looking on path. For those TORs where drivers looked off path at the time of the TOR, the off-path glance was most commonly towards an NDRT item. Then, for 72% of TORs (independent on gaze direction), drivers started their response process to the TOR by looking towards the instrument cluster before placing their hands on the steering wheel and their foot on the accelerator pedal, and deactivating automation. Both timing and order of these actions varied among participants, but all participants deactivated AD within 10 s from the TOR. The drivers' gaze direction at the TOR had a stronger association with the response process than the repeated exposure to TORs did. Drivers can respond to TORs in real traffic. However, the response should be considered as a sequence of actions that requires a certain amount of time.

AB A large amount of data acquisition and annotation work is required to train a supervised machine learning model for open scenes. However, traditional manual approaches are inefficient. Here, a method is proposed for on-site image acquisition and semiautomatic annotation based on eye-tracking. This method uses the recognition capabilities and computational advantages of humans and machines to improve annotation efficiency, overcoming the bottleneck of AI-based approaches to the natural scenery understanding of field robots. The proposed method contains three advancements. First, we designed a head-mounted display with a built-in pose measurement module to achieve first-person teleoperation data acquisition, where a pseudoframe interpolation algorithm is designed to overcome the latency problem in immersive remote data transmission and to achieve efficient field data acquisition. Second, we propose an adaptive superpixel segmentation algorithm to reduce human-machine interactions based on eye-tracking. Third, since traditionally, the annotation process cannot provide feedback to the acquisition process and results in a low conversion rate. We proposed a new conversion rate index denoting the rate of transforming collected data into valid data to quantify the acquisition quality in real time. While achieving an annotation quality of 0.964 per the Dice index, which is approximately equal to that of the manual method, the proposed method improves the annotation efficiency by more than 3 times. Finally, the agricultural field experiments containing a real-life scene of robotic tomato-picking verified that the proposed method based on human-computer interaction can make full use of human perception and recognition intelligence.

DE Stereo-SLAM; Multimodal features; Feature association; Bundle adjustment
AB Much work has been done to improve visual SLAM systems by integrating point, line, and plane features into the bundle adjustment model, however little attention has been paid to explore the associations between these spatial features that could be used to achieve better performance. This study proposes a multimodal feature association-based stereo SLAM method. Firstly, a method to extract point and line features from stereo images and estimate plane features through the line features is proposed. Then, the corresponding mathematic models for representing the association relations between different features are given. After that, the association relations are integrated into the back-end optimization model to improve system robustness and accuracy by adjusting reprojection errors with confidence weights. Finally, comparison tests are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with the mainstream stereo SLAM systems using the EuRoC and KITTI datasets. The test results show that our approach not only generates semantic maps with higher fidelity but also provides a better positioning capability, with the positioning accuracy of the algorithm on the EuRoC and KITTI datasets improved by an average of 14.78% and 20.09%, respectively.

AB The accumulation of litter is increasing in many places and is consequently becoming a problem that must be dealt with. In this paper, we present a manipulator robotic system to collect litter in outdoor environments. This system has three functionalities. Firstly, it uses colour images to detect and recognise litter comprising different materials. Secondly, depth data are combined with pixels of waste objects to compute a 3D location and segment three-dimensional point clouds of the litter items in the scene. The grasp in 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) is then estimated for a robot arm with a gripper for the segmented cloud of each instance of waste. Finally, two tactile-based algorithms are implemented and then employed in order to provide the gripper with a sense of touch. This work uses two low-cost visual-based tactile sensors at the fingertips. One of them addresses the detection of contact (which is obtained from tactile images) between the gripper and solid waste, while another has been designed to detect slippage in order to prevent the objects grasped from falling. Our proposal was successfully tested by carrying out extensive experimentation with different objects varying in size, texture, geometry and materials in different outdoor environments (a tiled pavement, a surface of stone/soil, and grass). Our system achieved an average score of 94% for the detection and Collection Success Rate (CSR) as regards its overall performance, and of 80% for the collection of items of litter at the first attempt.

AB Wheeled field robots have promising widespread civil and military applications in off-road conditions. The complex off-road working conditions pose substantial challenges in applying field robots, especially the newly emerged fully autonomous "smart" mobile ground robots without human intervention. Two key issues arise for a successful navigation, namely geometrical and non-geometrical obstacles. So far, most of the research on off-road mobile robots has focused on approaches to avoid geometrical obstacles by ignoring the influence of wheel slippage on the robot mobility. On the other hand, wheel slippage plays a key role in the performance of off-road mobile robots and must be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the methods in the study on the wheel slippage estimation and modeling of off-road mobile robots, along with the control and sensing technology, and report the state-of-the-art in this research field. Multiple approaches: proprioceptive-sensor-based, exteroceptive-sensor-based, model-based slippage estimation and compensation methods will be discussed. In addition, this paper also investigates the new research trend of developing machine learning methods to predict and compensate for the wheel slippage under complex working conditions. Current technical challenges and room for further research improvement are also generalized. This paper will help researchers new in this field to be familiar with the wheel slippage modeling, control and sensing technology, and inspire for the next-generation robot design that can help address the wheel slippage issues.

   detectors; KFC; neighborhood consistency
AB Unsupervised k-nearest-neighbor-based outlier detectors play a vital role in data science research. However, the detectors' performance relies on the choice of the parameter k. However, autonomous selection of the optimal k is poorly documented in literature as it is very challenging. Conventional methods prove ineffective and lack universality as they fail to account for both application and detector factors simultaneously. This article proposes neighborhood consistency, a new concept which tackles the existing issues of selecting the optimal k by considering both application and detector factors. This concept was used to develop a method termed k finder based on neighborhood consistency (KFC). KFC does not rely on any extra parameter and has linear time complexity. Simulations show that KFC outperformed baselines and had a good generality to different datasets and detectors. The implementation of the proposed methods can be found on www.OutlierNet.com for reproducibility.

AB Flexible, continuum-type robots can access narrow spaces in debris areas during search-and-rescue missions. However, their current problem is the lifting capability of the head, which is necessary to surmount the rubble. This study proposes a passive-thrust vectoring method to stabilize head levitation for air-jet-actuated, long, continuum robots, and thus enhance their step-climbing abilities. An air jet can generate a thrust force that is sufficient for head levitation. A critical issue in levitation involves the backward bending of the head without using any air-jet control; however, thrust control is inappropriate because of the delay caused by the long channel. Therefore, the proposed method maintains the thrust direction constant. Sufficient conditions for global stability are derived and confirmed via dynamic simulations. The proposed method is simple and can be mechanically realized with a passive head-bending mechanism, thus contributing to a lightweight design. Experiments demonstrated that the developed air-floating-type, 7-m long robot, can achieve stabilized head levitation, and that the robot can climb a step with a height of 250 mm. Robot demonstrations in rubble justify the robot's capacity to surmount the rubble. This passive-thrust vectoring method is expected to contribute to the future enhancement of the mobility of continuum robots owing to its simplicity and practicality.

AB Insufficient training data is a common barrier to effectively learn multimodal information interactions and question semantics in existing medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) models. This paper proposes a new Asymmetric Cross Modal Attention network called ACMA, which constructs an image-guided attention and a question-guided attention to improve multimodal interactions from insufficient data. In addition, a Semantic Understanding Auxiliary (SUA) in the question-guided attention is newly designed to learn rich semantic embeddings for improving model performance on question understanding by integrating word-level and sentencelevel information. Moreover, we propose a new data augmentation method called Multimodal Augmented Mixup (MAM) to train the ACMA, denoted as ACMA-MAM. The MAM incorporates various data augmentations and a vanilla mixup strategy to generate more non-repetitive data, which avoids time-consuming artificial data annotations and improves model generalization capability. Our ACMA-MAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on three publicly accessible medical VQA datasets (VQA-Rad, VQA-Slake, and PathVQA) with accuracies of 76.14 %, 83.13 %, and 53.83 % respectively, achieving improvements of 2.00 %, 1.32 %, and 1.59 % accordingly. Moreover, our model achieves F1 scores of 78.33 %, 82.83 %, and 51.86 %, surpassing the state-of-the-art models by 2.80 %, 1.15 %, and 1.37 % respectively.

ID UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION
AB Self-supervised pre-training has become the priory choice to establish reliable neural networks for automated recognition of massive biomedical microscopy images, which are routinely annotationfree, without semantics, and without guarantee of quality. Note that this paradigm is still at its infancy and limited by closely related open issues: (1) how to learn robust representations in an unsupervised manner from unlabeled biomedical microscopy images of low diversity in samples? and (2) how to obtain the most significant representations demanded by a high-quality segmentation? Aiming at these issues, this study proposes a knowledge-based learning framework (TOWER) towards enhanced recognition of biomedical microscopy images, which works in three phases by synergizing contrastive learning and generative learning methods: (1) Sample Space Diversification: Reconstructive proxy tasks have been enabled to embed a priori knowledge with context highlighted to diversify the expanded sample space; (2) Enhanced Representation Learning: Informative noise-contrastive estimation loss regularizes the encoder to enhance representation learning of annotation-free images; (3) Correlated Optimization: Optimization operations in pre-training the encoder and the decoder have been correlated via image restoration from proxy tasks, targeting the need for semantic segmentation. Experiments have been conducted on public datasets of biomedical microscopy images against the state-of-the-art counterparts (e.g., SimCLR and BYOL), and results demonstrate that: TOWER statistically excels in all self-supervised methods, achieving a Dice improvement of 1.38 percentage points over SimCLR. TOWER also has potential in multi-modality medical image analysis and enables label-efficient semi-supervised learning, e.g., reducing the annotation cost by up to 99% in pathological classification.

AB This paper designs a consensus control protocol for multi-agent systems(MAS) based on the edge-event triggering mechanism to achieve a leader-following consensus under Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the dynamics model of the multi-agent system is given, and the DoS attack is modeled. A compensator is designed for each follower separately to keep tracking the state of the leader. In this paper, agents are classified into leaders, informed followers, and uninformed followers. The event-triggering conditions are designed separately. Then, the controller of each agent is designed using the difference between the state of the compensator and the agent state. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, the effectiveness of the designed control strategy under the DoS attack is analyzed, and the constraints on the control parameters are given. Additionally, we proved that the proposed control strategy could avoid the Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through numerical simulations.

AB The decision tree (DT) is a well-established tool used to classify information. Its efficiency in accessing data and the accuracy of its outcomes is largely dependent on the characteristics of the input data and the efficacy of the construction processes and algorithms. In this study, we are introducing an innovative approach called the Semantic Decision Tree (SDT). The SDT builds upon the concept of the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm. Our proposed SDT's first application involves utilizing a knowledge base, intentionally designed to support the DT construction process. The primary goal here is to effectively address the multi-value bias selection issue, a recurring problem found in a number of DT algorithms. Building on this, we adopt an ontology summarization technique to fine-tune the splitting condition of the DT. This adjustment is influenced by the attribute's importance value, extracted directly from the ontology. This process leads to the creation of nodes that align more precisely with the dataset than those generated by traditional DT methods. To validate the robustness and precision of our proposed SDT, we evaluated it across four distinct datasets. In addition, we benchmarked the classification accuracy of our SDT against several leading baseline algorithms; the traditional ID3, C4.5, CART, and the Mutual Information Decision Tree (MIDT). The findings demonstrate that our proposed SDT outperforms these industry-standard algorithms in terms of accuracy. Further in-depth qualitative analysis showed that the modifications in information gain resulted in DT structures that align more naturally with human decision making logic.

AB Rear-end collisions result in a large number of casualties and property losses, and the serious injury risk in multiple impact accidents is much higher than that in single impact accidents. In this paper, we propose a novel controller to facilitate the prevention of secondary crashes after an initial rear-end collision, which expands the operational horizon of conventional vehicle active safety systems from preventive measures to post-event mitigation measures. Considering the complexity of the problem with multi-object synthesis optimization and vehicle nonlinear dynamics, this study combines the pre-collision control and post-collision control to reduce the initial crash loss and the subsequent control difficulty. The rule-based switching control and drift manipulation are embedded into the reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the training efficiency and control performance. The bench test results validate the superiority of the proposed controller over other strategies and algorithms in different rear-end collision scenarios.

AB Trauma is the leading cause of death in adults under the age of 45 and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Effective delivery of trauma care centers on being well versed in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, which requires high levels of clinical experience. Often this comes from having been exposed to the many permutations of common types of injuries as well as exposed to rarer scenarios, but with potential harm to patients. Case scenarios, which are sequential representations of clinical events, can help trainees receive clinical exposure without harming patients. However authoring case scenarios requires domain expertise, wide experience, and the ability to intelligently respond to inputs, and as such is currently an arduous task. Autoregressive generative models trained on large amounts of clinical data, such as the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), pose a possible solution to overcome the cost of authorship while providing broad and accessible clinical experience to trainees. We have developed a Trauma AI model composed of an autoregressive generative model based on the transformer architecture for generating potential case scenario combined with an out-of-domain detection for filtering out less plausible scenarios. The GPT2 model is trained on 1.1 million case scenarios derived from the NTDB data. We demonstrate that Trauma AI is capable of generating realistic case scenarios that encode the ATLS protocol as a latent feature of the sequence of provider interventions, including scenarios that do not have any parallels in the original dataset. We also present an unsupervised means of filtering out unrealistic sequences by identifying out-of-domain sequences, and demonstrate that this improves the realism of the generated case scenarios.

AB Encouraged by the success of pretrained Transformer models in many natural language processing tasks, their use for International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding tasks is now actively being explored. In this study, we investigated two existing Transformer-based models (PLM-ICD and XR-Transformer) and proposed a novel Transformer-based model (XR-LAT), aiming to address the extreme label set and long text classification challenges that are posed by automated ICD coding tasks. The Transformer-based model PLM-ICD, which currently holds the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD coding benchmark datasets MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, was selected as our baseline model for further optimisation on both datasets. In addition, we extended the capabilities of the leading model in the general extreme multi-label text classification domain, XR-Transformer, to support longer sequences and trained it on both datasets. Moreover, we proposed a novel model, XR-LAT, which was also trained on both datasets. XR-LAT is a recursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with label-wise attention, knowledge transferring and dynamic negative sampling mechanisms. Our optimised PLM-ICD models, which were trained with longer total and chunk sequence lengths, significantly outperformed the current SOTA PLM-ICD models, and achieved the highest micro-F1 scores of 60.8 % and 50.9 % on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, respectively. The XR-Transformer model, although SOTA in the general domain, did not perform well across all metrics. The best XR-LAT based models obtained results that were competitive with the current SOTA PLM-ICD models, including improving the macro-AUC by 2.1 % and 5.1 % on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, respectively. Our optimised PLM-ICD models are the new SOTA models for automated ICD coding on both datasets, while our novel XR-LAT models perform competitively with the previous SOTA PLM-ICD models.

AB As a mean to monitor the rapid expansion of the highly decentralized PV market, identifying solar energy systems in aerial imagery by deep machine learning, is a research field that is getting increasing interest. One general challenge in the field is to create testing data of high quality that are representative of the end-use application. In this study we use the open source convolutional neural network developed within the DeepSolar project and apply it in the country of Sweden, for the purpose of generating market statistics, by scanning three complete municipalities for small decentralized photovoltaic and solar thermal systems. The evaluation of the performance is done against a highly accurate ground truth, which was created by cross-checking the classification results with the inventory of the local distribution system operators and the database of photovoltaic systems that have received a capital subsidy in Sweden, and combining that with physical onsite inspections. A process of generate additional training data and re-training the algorithm after each municipality scan was developed, which successively improved the accuracy, resulting in that 95% of all detectable photovoltaic, excluding building integrated and vertical systems, and 80% of all detectable solar thermal systems were correctly identified in the last municipality scan. The accurate ground truth allowed a quantification of why some systems are not detected. The generated dataset of solar energy systems could be connected to existing building and property inventories, which allowed creation of market segment statistics with remarkably high detail information.

AB Ridge curves retrieval in time-frequency (TF) domains is fundamental in many application fields as they convey most of information concerning the instantaneous frequencies of non-stationary signals. However, it represents a very hard task in the case of multicomponent signals having non-separable modes as they generate interference in TF domains. A preliminary detection of these interference regions may be then useful for the definition of effective strategies for ridge curve recovery. This paper introduces SIID-CNN (Spectrogram Image Interference Detection via CNN), that is a novel approach based on machine learning for the automatic detection of interference regions in spectrogram images. Each spectrogram sample is suitably classified as interference, single mode or background by accounting for its relative information. Some critical problems, such as the training set size and the type of examples to use for populating the training set, are dealt with. Experimental results show that a local linear model for spectrogram image and a small training set can guarantee good classification rates for a wide class of non-stationary signals, even in the presence of moderate noise.

DE Image dehazing; Unsupervised learning; Visual-quality-driven;

AB Most of the existing learning-based dehazing methods require a diverse and large collection of paired hazy/clean images, which is intractable to obtain. Therefore, existing dehazing methods resort to training on synthetic images. This may result in a possible domain shift when treating real scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised dehazing (lightweight) network without any reference images to directly predict clear images from the original hazy images, which consists of an interactive fusion module (IFM) and an iterative optimization module (IOM). Specifically, IFM interactively fuses multi-level features to make up for the missing information among deep and shallow features while IOM iteratively optimizes dehazed results to obtain pleasing visual effects. Particularly, based on the observation that hazy images usually suffer from quality degradation, four non-reference visual-quality-driven loss functions are designed to enable the network trained in an unsupervised way, including dark channel loss, contrast loss, saturation loss, and edge sharpness loss. Extensive experiments on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art unsupervised dehazing methods and even matches some supervised methods in terms of metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UQI.

AB This paper considers an optimal control of an affine nonlinear system with unknown system dynamics. A new identifier-critic framework is proposed to solve the optimal control problem. Firstly, a neural network identifier is built to estimate the unknown system dynamics, and a critic NN is constructed to solve the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the optimal control problem. A dynamic regressor extension and mixing technique is applied to design the weight update laws with relaxed persistence of excitation conditions for the two classes of neural networks. The parameter estimation of the update laws and the stability of the closed-loop system under the adaptive optimal control are analyzed using a Lyapunov function method. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IC learning based optimal control algorithm for the affine nonlinear system.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Visual question generation aims to focus on some target objects in an image to generate questions with certain questioning purposes. Existing studies mainly utilize an answer to extract the target object corresponding to the questioning purpose for questioning. However, answers fail to accurately and completely map to every target object, such as the objects corresponding to the answer are ambiguous or the answers are the relationship between multiple objects. To address this problem, we propose a content-controlled question generation model, which generates questions based on a given target object set specified from an image. Considering that the target objects have different contributions during the generation process, we design a recurrent generative architecture to explicitly control attention to different objects and their corresponding image information at each generative stage. Extensive experiments on the VQA v2.0 dataset and the Visual7w dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and can controllably generate questions with specified content.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper is concerned with self-representation subspace learning. It is one of the most representative subspace techniques, which has attracted considerable attention for clustering due to its good performance. Among these methods, low-rank representation (LRR) has achieved impressive results for subspace clustering. However, it only considers the similarity between the data itself, while neglecting the differences with other samples. Besides, it cannot well deal with noise and portray cluster-to -cluster relationships well. To solve these problems, we propose a Contrastive Self-representation model for Clustering (CSC). CSC simultaneously takes into account the similarity/dissimilarity between positive/negative pairs when learning the self-representation coefficient matrix of data while the form of the loss function can reduce the effect of noise on the results. Moreover, We use the l1,2- norm regularizer on the coefficient matrix to achieve its sparsity to better characterize the cluster structure. Thus, the learned self-representation coefficient matrix well encodes both the discriminative information and cluster structure. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark databases indicate the superiority of our proposed method.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Health-care waste (HCW) contains numerous hazardous, infectious, and radioactive contents that may cause serious health issues for society and drastic environmental problems. Therefore, it is crucial to dispose of HCW safely and appropriately. Four commonly used HCW disposal methods are incineration, steam sterilization, microwave, and landfill disposal. To select an appropriate HCW disposal method, there are several conflicting criteria. Furthermore, when information is lacking due to uncertainty and criteria weighing conditions are also unknown, the decision to choose an appropriate HCW disposal method becomes more challenging. So, the objective of this paper is to introduce a novel integrated multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach to evaluate HCW disposal methods in which incomplete information is quantified using intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), unknown criteria weights are evaluated using the maximizing deviation method, and the evaluation of HCW disposal methods is done by applying the Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm-based interactive intuitionistic fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method. Herein, the Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm cover a wide range of t-norms and t-conorms, including the Algebraic, Einstein, Hamacher, and Frank, etc., by adopting prescribed combinations of additive generators. The proposed MCGDM approach has been applied to evaluate the above-listed four HCW disposal methods for a case study conducted by Mishra et al. (2020) in the context of India. A sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of changes in the parameters involved in the proposed MCGDM approach. A comparative study is also performed with some well-known multi-criteria decision making(MCDM) and MCGDM methods to demonstrate the consistency and stability of the proposed approach. Findings suggest that the newly developed MCGDM approach is more general, flexible, and provides realistic results to evaluate HCW disposal methods under uncertainty and unknown criteria weight information.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ATTENTION
AB As powerful as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is, responding your query with a bird name of "Whip-poor-will" or "Mallard" probably does not make much sense. This however commonly accepted in the literature, underlines a fundamental question interfacing AI and human - what constitutes transferable knowledge for human to learn from AI? This paper sets out to answer this very question using FGVC as a test bed. Specifically, we envisage a scenario where a trained FGVC model (the AI expert) functions as a knowledge provider in enabling average people (you and me) to become better domain experts ourselves. Assuming an AI expert trained using expert human labels, we anchor our focus on asking and providing solutions for two questions: (i) what is the best transferable knowledge we can extract from AI, and (ii) what is the most practical means to measure the gains in expertise given that knowledge? We propose to represent knowledge as highly discriminative visual regions that are expert-exclusive and instantiate it via a novel multi-stage learning framework. A human study of 15,000 trials shows our method is able to consistently improve people of divergent bird expertise to recognise once unrecognisable birds. We further propose a crude but benchmarkable metric TEMI and therefore allow future efforts in this direction to be comparable to ours without the need of large-scale human studies.

AB Facial affect recognition is a critical skill in human interactions that is often impaired in psychiatric disorders. To address this challenge, tests have been developed to measure and train this skill. Recently, virtual human (VH) and virtual reality (VR) technologies have emerged as novel tools for this purpose. This study investigates the unique contributions of different factors in the communication and perception of emotions conveyed by VHs. Specifically, it examines the effects of the use of action units (AUs) in virtual faces, the positioning of the VH (frontal or mid-profile), and the level of immersion in the VR environment (desktop screen versus immersive VR). Thirty-six healthy subjects participated in each condition. Dynamic virtual faces (DVFs), VHs with facial animations, were used to represent the six basic emotions and the neutral expression. The results highlight the important role of the accurate implementation of AUs in virtual faces for emotion recognition. Furthermore, it is observed that frontal views outperform mid-profile views in both test conditions, while immersive VR shows a slight improvement in emotion recognition. This study provides novel insights into the influence of these factors on emotion perception and advances the understanding and application of these technologies for effective facial emotion recognition training.

AB The underwater optical imaging environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity. This paper addresses the limitations of existing algorithms in handling underwater images captured in artificial light scenes. We proposed an underwater artificial light optimization algorithm to preprocess images with uneven lighting, mitigating the effects of light distortion. Furthermore, we proposed a novel underwater image enhancement algorithm based the Multiscale Fusion Generative Adversarial Network, named UMSGAN, to address the issues of low contrast and color distortion. UMSGAN uses the generative adversarial network as the underlying framework and first extracts information from the degraded image through three parallel branches separately, and adds residual dense blocks in each branch to learn deeper features. Subsequently, the features extracted from the three branches are fused and the detailed information of the image is recovered by the reconstruction module, named RM. Finally, multiple loss functions are linearly superimposed, and the adversarial network is trained iteratively to obtain the enhanced underwater images. The algorithm is designed to accommodate various underwater scenes, providing both color correction and detail enhancement. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm, considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse underwater image dataset. The proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance in terms of enhancing underwater image quality, achieving significant improvements in contrast, color accuracy, and detail preservation. The proposed methodology exhibits promising results, offering potential applications in various domains such as underwater photography, marine exploration, and underwater surveillance.

AB Aerostructures are important components of an aircraft's aerodynamic shape, and their assembly requires high precision. To ensure optimal external shape performance, a significant number of assembly deviation calculations must be performed during the design process of an aerostructure. However, accurately describing shape deviation necessitates high-fidelity surface deformation data. Therefore, an assembly deviation analysis method that balances rapid response and accurate calculation under conditions of large data volume and high cost plays a vital role in promoting the external performance of aerostructures. While some progress has been made in this field, the existing methods are still unable to fill this research gap completely. This paper proposes an advanced rigid-flexible hybrid assembly deviation analysis (RFHA) method for aerostructural shape deviation. It decomposes assembly deviation into rigid deviation transmission and flexible deformation, unifying them in one framework. This method predicts the flexible deformation of aerostructures using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and surrogate model (SM). It also develops a rigid-flexible hybrid assembly deviation analysis method in combination with the Jacobian-Torsor model (J-T). To further reduce computational resources and improve the performance of the surrogate model, the mega-trend diffusion (MTD) is utilized to generate virtual samples to expand the sample set. Relevant parameters of the proposed method are determined using experimental methods. The proposed method is validated and compared with an existing RFHA and a commercial software package. The results show that the proposed method can guarantee prediction performance under small sample conditions and reduce computational burden, while maintaining a certain advantage in rapid response and accurate calculation.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB Many-Objective Optimization Problems, or MaOPs, are complex optimization problems with more than three objective functions. Traditional Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have shown poor scalability in solving this problem. Neuroevolution techniques can be used to overdraw that problem. The use of machine learning techniques to enhance optimization algorithms applied to MaOPs has drawn attention due to their capacity to add domain knowledge during the search process. One method of this kind is inverse surrogate modeling for fitness estimation, which uses machine learning models to enhance MOEAs, mapping the objective function values to the decision variables. Some inverse modeling methods in literature have performed well in various optimization problems. Despite the promising results, new strategies using the generated knowledge during the search can be further improved. The main goal of this work is to propose a framework that uses an inverse modeling approach coupled with an MOEA. The inverse surrogate modeling is used to sample solutions that are combined with the evolutionary search of the MOEA. The framework is evaluated in different scenarios, including multi-objective benchmark problems and real-world problems. The results show that the proposed framework had statistically better or equivalent results in 86% scenarios in the benchmark problems and 100% scenarios in the real-world problem.

DE Reinforcement learning; bipartite matching; taxi dispatching
ID DEMANDS
AB Ride hailing has become prevailing. Central in ride hailing platforms is taxi order dispatching which involves recommending a suitable driver for each order. Previous works use pure combinatorial optimization solutions for taxi dispatching, which suffer in practice due to complex dynamics of demand and supply and temporal dependency among dispatching decisions. Recent studies try to adopt data-driven method into combinatorial optimization hoping knowledge from history data would help overcome these challenges. Among these attempts, adoption of reinforcement learning shows great promise but current adoptions are a unidirectional integration which restricts the potential performance gains. In this work, we propose Learning To Dispatch(LTD), a systematic solution that allows synergic integration of reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization for large-scale taxi order dispatching. We demonstrate the necessity of online learning and taxi scheduling for reinforcement learning to work in synergy with combinatorial optimization, and devise corresponding algorithms. We also devise many tricks for more efficient calculation of the bipartite matching. Experiments show our methods can improve 36.4% and 42.0% on utility and efficiency at most, respectively. Especially, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of utility.

TI Learning From Atypical Behavior: Temporary Interest Aware Recommendation
   Based on Reinforcement Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Robust recommendation; temporary interest; deep reinforcement learning
AB Traditional robust recommendation methods view atypical user-item interactions as noise and aim to reduce their impact with some kind of noise filtering technique, which often suffers from two challenges. First, in real world, atypical interactions may signal users' temporary interest different from their general preference. Therefore, simply filtering out the atypical interactions as noise may be inappropriate and degrade the personalization of recommendations. Second, it is hard to acquire the temporary interest since there are no explicit supervision signals to indicate whether an interaction is atypical or not. To address this challenges, we propose a novel model called Temporary Interest Aware Recommendation (TIARec), which can distinguish atypical interactions from normal ones without supervision and capture the temporary interest as well as the general preference of users. Particularly, we propose a reinforcement learning framework containing a recommender agent and an auxiliary classifier agent, which are jointly trained with the objective of maximizing the cumulative return of the recommendations made by the recommender agent. During the joint training process, the classifier agent can judge whether the interaction with an item recommended by the recommender agent is atypical, and the knowledge about learning temporary interest from atypical interactions can be transferred to the recommender agent, which makes the recommender agent able to alone make recommendations that balance the general preference and temporary interest of users. At last, the experiments conducted on real world datasets verify the effectiveness of TIARec.

TI Causal Disentanglement for Semantic-Aware Intent Learning in
   Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Causal disentanglement learning; causal intervention; semantic-aware
   representation
AB Traditional recommendation models trained on observational interaction data have generated large impacts in a wide range of applications, it faces bias problems that cover users' true intent and thus deteriorate the recommendation effectiveness. Existing methods track this problem as eliminating bias for the robust recommendation, e.g., by re-weighting training samples or learning disentangled representations. The disentangled representation methods as the state-of-the-art eliminate bias by revealing cause-effect of the bias generation. However, how to design the semantic-aware and unbiased representations for users' true intents is largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, we are the first to propose an unbiased and semantic-aware disentanglement learning called CaDSI(<bold>Ca</bold>usal <bold>D</bold>isentanglement for <bold>S</bold>emantics-Aware <bold>I</bold>ntent Learning) from a causal perspective. Particularly, CaDSI explicitly models the causal relations underlying recommendation task, and thus produces semantic-aware representations via disentangling users' true intents aware of specific item context. Moreover, the causal intervention mechanism is designed to eliminate confounding bias stemming from context information, which further aligns the semantic-aware representation with users' true intent. Extensive experiments and case studies both validate the robustness and interpretability of our proposed model.

TI MetaKG: Meta-Learning on Knowledge Graph for Cold-Start Recommendation

   models; Training; Noise measurement; Cold-start recommendation;

AB A knowledge graph (KG) consists of a set of interconnected typed entities and their attributes. Recently, KGs are popularly used as the auxiliary information to enable more accurate, explainable, and diverse user preference recommendations. Specifically, existing KG-based recommendation methods target modeling high-order relations/dependencies from long connectivity user-item interactions hidden in KG. However, most of them ignore the cold-start problems (i.e., user cold-start and item cold-start) of recommendation analytics, which restricts their performance in scenarios when involving new users or new items. Inspired by the success of meta-learning on scarce training samples, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework called MetaKG, which encompasses a collaborative-aware meta learner and a knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture meta users' preference and entities' knowledge for cold-start recommendations. The collaborative-aware meta learner aims to locally aggregate user preferences for each preference learning task. In contrast, the knowledge-aware meta learner is to globally generalize knowledge representation across different user preference learning tasks. Guided by two meta learners, MetaKG can effectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic representations, which could be easily adapted to cold-start scenarios. Besides, we devise a novel adaptive task scheduler which can adaptively select the informative tasks for meta learning in order to prevent the model from being corrupted by noisy tasks. Extensive experiments on various cold-start scenarios using three real datasets demonstrate that our presented MetaKG outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.

ID LONG TAIL; NETWORKS
AB One key property in recommender systems is the long-tail distribution in user-item interactions where most items only have few user feedback. Improving the recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects to both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender systems. Current novel recommendation methods over-emphasize the importance of tail items without differentiating the degree of users' intent on popularity and often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing studies has ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without any interaction, into consideration. In this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user's interaction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into conformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then present a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and novelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of preference. We further develop a new paradigm for novel recommendation of cold-start items which exploits the self-supervised learning technique to model the correlation between collaborative features and content features. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed model yields significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and novelty.

AB Recent advances in reinforcement learning have inspired increasing interest in learning user modeling adaptively through dynamic interactions, e.g., in reinforcement learning based recommender systems. In most reinforcement learning applications, reward functions provide the critical guideline for optimization. However, current reinforcement learning-based methods rely on manually-defined reward functions, which cannot adapt to dynamic, noisy environments. Moreover, they generally use task-specific reward functions that sacrifice generalization ability. We propose a generative inverse reinforcement learning for user behavioral preference modeling to address the above issues. Instead of using predefined reward functions, our model can automatically learn the rewards from user's actions based on discriminative actor-critic network and Wasserstein GAN. Our model provides a general approach to characterizing and explaining underlying behavioral tendencies. Our experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several scenarios, namely traffic signal control, online recommender systems, and scanpath prediction.

ID MODEL SELECTION
AB The traditional recommendation systems mainly use offline user data to train offline models, and then recommend items for online users, thus suffering from the unreliable estimation of user preferences based on sparse and noisy historical data. Conversational Recommendation System(CRS) uses the interactive form of the dialogue systems to solve the intrinsic problems of traditional recommendation systems. However, due to the lack of contextual information modeling, the existing CRS models are unable to deal with the exploitation and exploration(E & E) problem well, resulting in the heavy burden on users. To address the aforementioned issue, this work proposes a contextual information enhancement model tailored for CRS, called Knowledge Graph-enhanced Sampling(KGenSam). KGenSam integrates the dynamic graph of user interaction data with the external knowledge into one heterogeneous Knowledge Graph(KG) as the contextual information environment. Then, two samplers are designed to enhance knowledge by sampling fuzzy samples with high uncertainty for obtaining user preferences and reliable negative samples for updating recommender to achieve efficient acquisition of user preferences and model updating, and thus provide a powerful solution for CRS to deal with E & E problem. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of KGenSam with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recommender systems across many Internet services have become a critical part of online businesses, as consumers would refer to them before making decisions. However, the lack of explicit ratings for items on many services makes it challenging to capture user preferences and item characteristics. Both academia and the industry have drawn attention to rating predications as a fundamental problem in recommendation systems. With the emergence of social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize the relationship between users and items to alleviate the data sparsity problem for rating predictions. However, they either concentrate on the opinion mining for each user and item, or consider the connections between users only. In this paper, we present an effective framework, Triple-hierarchical Attention Graph-based social rating prediction (TAG), to exploit the social relationships between users, the user-item interest relationships, the correlation relationships between items, and reviews for rating predictions. In order to consider opinions from reviews and these complex relationships, we first employ two triple-hierarchical attention to extract user and item features from reviews. We then design an inductive GNN, which generates effective embedding for users and items. Experiments over Yelp show that TAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods across RMSE, MAE, and NDCG metrics.

TI Value-Wise ConvNet for Transformer Models: An Infinite Time-Aware
   Recommender System

DE Online expert recommendation; user behavioral patterns; context-wise
   transformers; time-aware embedding
AB Finding the most suitable individual to answer a question using brief content has important usages, including the community of question answering systems and online recommender frameworks. However, one must tackle challenges: Disregarding the indispensable noise in short text contents, authors usually answer the input query with mismatched words that can negatively influence the textual relevance. Moreover, many vocabularies imply various alterations. Finally, not every expert is eager to answer an input query given the time constraint, named the reluctance dilemma. To overcome the challenges, we devise a novel embedding approach that constructs context-aware vectors. We then extract the knowledge domains out of the online contextual content. While we track user textual-temporal behavioral patterns via an infinite continuous-time module, we recommend a set of experts pertinent to the given query and willingly provide the response during the expected time. Experimental results on two real-world datasets of StackOverflow and Yahoo show that our online time-sensitive value-wise transformer can achieve higher effectiveness and efficiency versus other trending rivals in online expert recommendation systems. In addition, we empirically experience that Fourier transformers can automatically infer multi-aspect base signals and overpass manual discrete-time models in obtaining time-specific user profiles.

AB We consider event extraction in a generative manner with template-based conditional generation. Although there is a rising trend of casting the task of event extraction as a sequence generation problem with prompts, these generation-based methods have several significant challenges, including using suboptimal prompts, static event type information, and the overwhelming number of irrelevant event types. In this article, we propose a generative template-based method with dynamic prefixes and a relevance retrieval framework for event extraction (GREE) by first integrating context information with type-specific prefixes to learn a context-specific prefix for each context, and then retrieving the relevant event types with an adaptive threshold. Experimental results show that our model achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art classification-based model OneIE on ACE 2005 and achieves the best performances on ERE. Additionally, our model is proven to be portable to new types of events effectively.

ID ARCHITECTURE SEARCH
AB Graph Neural Network (GNN) has achieved great success in the field of graph data processing and analysis, but the design of GNN architecture is difficult and time-consuming. To reduce the development cost of GNNs, recently, some GNN Neural Architecture Search (GNN NAS) techniques are presented for the automatic design of GNN architectures. These techniques bring great convenience to the use of GNN, but cannot be applied to the federated learning scenarios. They only consider the single-source graph dataset, while failing to deal with the distributed and private graph datasets, which limits their applications. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we propose FL-AGNNS, an efficient GNN NAS algorithm which enables distributed agents to cooperatively design powerful GNN models while keeping personal information on local devices. FL-AGNNS designs a novel federated evolutionary optimization strategy. This strategy can fully consider the GNN architectures favored by each client, thus recommend GNN architectures that perform well in multiple datasets. In additions, FL-AGNNS applies the GNN super-network, a weight sharing strategy, to speed up the evaluation of GNN models during the search phase. Extensive experimental results show that FL-AGNNS can recommend better GNN models in short time under the federated learning framework, surpassing the state-of-the-arts GNN models.

ID PASSENGER FLOW; ARCHITECTURE; NETWORKS
AB Urban metro flow prediction is of great value for metro operation scheduling, passenger flow management and personal travel planning. However, the problem is challenging. First, different metro stations, e.g. transfer stations and non-transfer stations have unique traffic patterns. Second, it is difficult to model complex spatio-temporal dynamic relation of metro stations. To address these challenges, we develop a spatio-temporal dynamic graph relational learning model (STDGRL) to predict urban metro station flow. First, we propose a spatio-temporal node embedding representation module to capture the traffic patterns of different stations. Second, we employ a dynamic graph relationship learning module to learn dynamic spatial relationships between metro stations without a predefined graph adjacency matrix. Finally, we provide a transformer-based long-term relationship prediction module for long-term metro flow prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted based on metro data in four cities, China, with experimental results demonstrating the advantages of our method compared over 14 baselines for urban metro flow prediction.

DE Additive kernels; PLAME; SVM
ID FEATURE MAPS; EFFICIENT; CLASSIFICATION
AB Additive Kernel SVM has been extensively used in many applications, including human activity detection and pedestrian detection. Since training an additive kernel SVM model is very time-consuming, which is not scalable to large-scale datasets, many efficient solutions have been developed in the past few years. However, most of the existing methods normally fail to achieve one of these three important conditions which are (1) low classification error, (2) low memory space, and (3) low training time. In order to simultaneously fulfill these three conditions, we develop the new piecewise-linear approximate measure (PLAME) for additive kernels. By incorporating PLAME with the well-known dual coordinate descent method, we theoretically show that this approach can achieve the above three conditions. Experimental results on twelve real datasets show that our approach can achieve the best trade-off between the accuracy, memory space, and training time compared with different types of state-of-the-art methods.

AB Online spatial crowdsourcing platforms provide popular O2O services in people's daily. Users submit real-time tasks through the Internet and require the platform to immediately assign workers to serve them. However, the imbalance distribution of tasks and workers leads to the rejection of some tasks, which reduces the profit of the platform. In this paper, we propose that similar platforms can form an alliance to make full use of the global service supply through cooperation. We name the problem as Global Task Assignment (GTA), in which platforms are allowed to hire idle workers from other platforms to improve the profit of all the platforms together. Different from relevant works, the decision-makers in GTA are platforms rather than individual workers, which can better assign workers in all platforms and improve the overall profit. We design an auction-based incentive mechanism (AIM), to motivate platforms to rent idle workers to other platforms so that increase their own profit. Based on the mechanism, we propose a greedy-based assignment algorithm (BaseGTA), in which platforms greedily maximizes their current profit. We further propose a prediction-based assignment algorithm (ImpGTA), in which platforms make decisions based on the spatial-temporal distribution in the future time. Experimental results show that platforms using our algorithms can achieve higher profit than the existing studies.

AB Fastest route recommendation (FRR) is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. The existing methods treat it as a pathfinding problem on dynamic graphs, and extend A* algorithm with neuralized travel time estimators as cost functions. However, they fail to provide effective heuristic cost due to the neglect of its admissibility and the utilization of noise path information, resulting in sub-optimal results and inefficiency. Besides, path sequentiality is also ignored, affecting algorithm accuracy as well. In this paper, we propose a variational inference based fastest route recommendation method, which follows the framework of A* algorithm and provides effective costs for routing. Specifically, we first adopt a sequential estimator to accurately estimate the travel time of a specific path. More importantly, we design a variational inference based estimator, which models the distribution of travel time between two nodes and provides an effective heuristic cost with high probability of being admissible. We further take advantage of adversarial learning to enrich the fastest path information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use variational estimator to consider the admissibility of heuristics in FRR. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. The results verify the performance advantage of our proposed method.

TI Minimum Recall-Based Loss Function for Imbalanced Time Series
   Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Multivariate time series; imbalanced classification; minimum recall;
   loss function; neural networks
AB This paper deals with imbalanced time series classification problems. In particular, we propose to learn time series classifiers that maximize the minimum recall of the classes rather than the accuracy. Consequently, we manage to obtain classifiers which tend to give the same importance to all the classes. Unfortunately, for most of the traditional classifiers, learning to maximize the minimum recall of the classes is not trivial (if possible), since it can distort the nature of the classifiers themselves. Neural networks, in contrast, are classifiers that explicitly define a loss function, allowing it to be modified. Given that the minimum recall is not a differentiable function, and therefore does not allow the use of common gradient-based learning methods, we apply and evaluate several smooth approximations of the minimum recall function. A thorough experimental evaluation shows that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods used in imbalanced time series classification, obtaining higher recall values for the minority classes, incurring only a slight loss in accuracy.

TI LiteWSEC: A Lightweight Framework for Web-Scale Spectral Ensemble
   Clustering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Spectral clustering; data quantization; scalability; ensemble clustering
ID NYSTROM METHOD; CUTS
AB Spectral Clustering (SC) is an effective clustering method for its excellent performance in partitioning non-linearly distributed data. On the other hand, Ensemble Clustering (EC), a different clustering technology, can promote cluster quality by ensembling the results of base clusterings. In this work, we concentrate on an EC framework that utilizes SC as the base method. Nevertheless, SC suffers from scalability due to its high computational complexity in constructing the Laplacian graph and computing the corresponding eigendecomposition. In the past decades, many efforts have been made to it. However, SC suffers from the scalability issue in processing extensive data, especially in web-scale scenarios. Additionally, EC requires multiple clustering results as the ensemble bases, which further aggravates resource consumption. To address this issue, LiteWSEC, a simple yet efficient Lightweight Framework for Web-scale Spectral Ensemble Clustering, is proposed to cluster web-scale data with limited resource requirements. It adopts the Web-scale Spectral Clustering (WSC) as the base method, which has minimal space overhead without computing overall embedding explicitly. LiteWSEC is highly flexible in the memory requirement, which is adaptive to the available resource. It can partition web-scale data (e.g., n = 8,000 k) in an resource-limited host (e.g., memory is restricted to 1 GB). Experiments on real-world, large-scale, and web-scale datasets demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of LiteWSEC over state-of-the-art SC and EC methods.

AB Origin-destination (OD) flow data, which reflects population mobility patterns in the city, is very important in many urban applications, such as urban planning and public resource allocation, etc. However, due to the high cost of money and time during device deployment and social surveys, it is challenging to obtain OD flow data, especially in developing cities and emerging cities where historical OD flow data is scarce. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate a method that can generate OD flow in cities where OD flow data are not available. The research on modeling population mobility in the city has a long history. Traditional gravity models, etc., are too simple to model the complex population mobility; recently proposed machine learning models and deep learning models are not applicable in cities where data are scarce because the parameters must be fitted with abundant data. To solve the problem of difficult access to OD flow data, we propose a method to learn mobility knowledge with ample data in the source city and generate OD flow data in new cities named GODDAG (Generating Origin-Destination Flow via Domain Adversarial Training). Our proposed method consists of two parts, one is a GNN (graph neural networks) based mobility model generating OD flow between every two regions based on regional attributes such as census and POI distribution, and the other is a domain adversarial training strategy to make the model have better transfer ability between different cities. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets to prove the validity of our methods.

AB Centrality measures can rank nodes in a social network according to their importance. However, in many cases, a node may want to avoid being highly ranked by such measures, e.g., as is the case with terrorist networks. In this work, we study a confrontation between the seeker-the party analyzing a social network using centrality measures-and the evader-a node attempting to decrease its ranking according to such measures. We analyze the possible outcomes of modifying, i.e., adding or removing, a single edge by the evader, showing that even without complete knowledge about the network, the effects of the modification on the evader's ranking can often be predicted. We study the computational complexity of finding a set of modifications that reduce the evader's centrality ranking in an optimal way, proving that these decision problems are NP-complete. Moreover, we provide a 2-approximation for the degree centrality, and logarithmic approximation boundaries for the closeness and betweenness centralities. Finally, we define and investigate a Stackelberg game between the seeker and the evader, providing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation of finding an equilibrium. Altogether, we provide a thorough analysis of the strategic aspects of hiding from centrality measures in social networks.

TI MM-FRec: Multi-Modal Enhanced Fashion Item Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Explainable recommendation; fashion recommendation; multi-modal data
AB Existing studies on fashion item recommendation mainly focused on incorporating the visual signals of items to boost the user preference learning, while overlooking the semantic attributes (e.g., material and brand) of fashion items that also contain important cues about items' properties and users' preference. To bridge this gap, we aim to comprehensively explore the attribute and vision modalities of items to improve the fashion item recommendation performance. However, this is non-trivial due to the latent visual-semantic consistency, various relation types, and unique attributes with insufficient samples. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Modal enhanced Fashion item Recommendation scheme (MM-FRec). Specifically, to cope with the multi-modal data, we introduce a relation-oriented graph as well as a vision-oriented graph, and design MM-FRec with three key components: attribute-enhanced latent representation learning, visual representation learning, and multi-modal enhanced preference modeling. To deal with the various relation types, we present a new relation-aware propagation method for adaptively aggregating the information from neighbor nodes to promote the user and item representation learning. To cope with the unique attributes, we introduce the deep multi-task learning strategy in the relation-aware confidence assignment. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods.

TI Optimizing Spaced Repetition Schedule by Capturing the Dynamics of

AB Spaced repetition, namely, learners review items in a given schedule, has been proven powerful for memorization and practice of skills. Most current spaced repetition methods focus on either predicting student recall or designing an optimal review schedule, thus omitting the integrity of the spaced repetition system. In this work, we propose a novel spaced repetition schedule framework by capturing the dynamics of memory, which alternates memory prediction and schedule optimization to improve the efficiency of learners' reviews. First, the framework collects logs from students' reviews and builds memory models with Markov property to capture the dynamics of memory. Then, the spaced repetition optimization is transformed a stochastic shortest path problem and solved via the value iteration method. We also construct a new benchmark dataset for spaced repetition, which is the first to contain time-series information during learners' memorization. Experimental results on the collected data from the real world and the simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces 64% error and 17% cost in predicting recall rates and optimizing schedules compared to several baselines. We have publicly released the dataset containing 220 million rows and codes used in this paper at: https://github.com/maimemo/SSP-MMC-Plus.

TI Feature-Level Deeper Self-Attention Network With Contrastive Learning
   for Sequential Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Contrastive learning; feature-level patterns; item-level patterns;
   self-attention network; sequential recommendation
AB Sequential recommendation, which aims to recommend next item that the user will likely interact in a near future, has become essential in various Internet applications. Existing methods usually consider the transition patterns between items, but ignore the transition patterns between features of items. We argue that only the item-level sequences cannot reveal the full sequential patterns, while explicit and implicit feature-level sequences can help extract the full sequential patterns. Meanwhile, the item-level sequential recommendation also suffers from limited supervised signal issues. In this article, we propose a novel model Feature-level Deeper Self-Attention Network with Contrastive Learning (FDSA-CL) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, FDSA-CL first integrates various heterogeneous features of items into feature-level sequences with different weights through a vanilla attention mechanism. After that, FDSA-CL applies separated self-attention blocks on item-level sequences and feature-level sequences, respectively, to model item transition patterns and feature transition patterns. Moreover, we propose contrastive learning and item feature recommendation tasks to capture the embedding commonality and further utilize the beneficial interaction among the two levels, so as to alleviate the sparsity of the supervised signal and extract the most critical information. Finally, we jointly optimize the above tasks. We evaluate the proposed model using two real-world datasets and experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

   forecasting; spatio-temporal; temporal
AB concentration forecasting is important yet challenging. First, complicated local fluctuations in PM2.5 concentrations disturb modeling global trends. Second, forecasting errors are often accumulated through an autoregressive process. To contend with the two challenges, we propose a Category Guidance based PM2.5 sequence Forecasting training framework (CGF) to enhance the performance of existing PM2.5 concentration fore casting models. CGF contains a Category based Representation Learning (CRL) module and a Category based Self-paced Learning (CSL) module, both of which utilize PM2.5 category information that is easily obtained and publicly available. First, CRL employs category information to guide forecasting models to produce more robust hidden representations that are insensitive to local fluctuations, thus alleviating the negative impact of local fluctuations. Second, CSL adaptively selects real PM2.5 concentration values versus autoregressive PM2.5 forecast values when training fore casting models, helping alleviate error accumulations. The CGF framework is applied to existing PM2.5 forecasting models, and the experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CGF is able to consistently improve the accuracy of existing forecasting models. Furthermore, to validate the generality of CGF, we conduct extensional experiments in two other time-series prediction tasks, including exchange rate forecasting and electricity forecasting. The experimental results also verify the effectiveness of CGF.

DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; renyi divergence; representation learning
AB In this article, we present an analysis of unsupervised domain adaptation with a series of theoretical and algorithmic results. We derive a novel Renyi-a divergence-based generalization bound, which is tailored to domain adaptation algorithms with arbitrary loss functions in a stochastic setting. Moreover, our theoretical results provide new insights into the assumptions for successful domain adaptation: the closeness between the conditional distributions of the domains and the Lipschitzness on the source domain. With these assumptions, we reveal the following: if their conditional generation distributions are close, the Lipschitzness property of the target domain can be transferred from the Lipschitzness on the source domain, without knowing the exact target distribution. Motivated by our analysis and assumptions, we further derive practical principles for deep domain adaptation: 1) Renyi-2 adversarial training for marginal distributions matching and 2) Lipschitz regularization for the classifier. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and the practical efficiency of the proposed principles.

AB Temporal graphs exhibit dynamic interactions between nodes over continuous time, whose topologies evolve with time elapsing. The whole temporal neighborhood of nodes reveals the varying preferences of nodes. However, previous works usually generate dynamic representation with limited neighbors for simplicity, which results in both inferior performance and high latency of online inference. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method of temporal graph convolution with the whole neighborhood, namely Temporal Aggregation and Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TAP-GNN). Specifically, we first analyze the computational complexity of the dynamic representation problem by unfolding the temporal graph in a message-passing paradigm. The expensive complexity motivates us to design the AP (aggregation and propagation) block, which significantly reduces the repeated computation of historical neighbors. The final TAP-GNN supports online inference in the graph stream scenario, which incorporates the temporal information into node embeddings with a temporal activation function and a projection layer besides several AP blocks. Experimental results on various real-life temporal networks show that our proposed TAP-GNN outperforms existing temporal graph methods by a large margin in terms of both predictive performance and online inference latency.

   identity linkage
AB User identity linkage, which aims to link identities of a natural person across different social platforms, has attracted increasing research interest recently. Existing approaches usually first embed the identities as deterministic vectors in a shared latent space, and then learn a classifier based on the available annotations. However, the formation and characteristics of real-world social platforms are full of uncertainties, which makes these deterministic embedding based methods sub-optimal. Besides, semi-supervised models utilize the unlabeled data to help capture the intrinsic data distribution. However, the existing semi-supervised linkage methods heavily rely on the heuristically defined similarity measurements to incorporate the innate closeness between labeled and unlabeled samples. Such manually designed assumptions may not be consistent with the actual linkage signals and further introduce the noises. To address the mentioned limitations, in this paper we propose a novel Noise-aware Semi-supervised Variational User Identity Linkage (NSVUIL) model. Specifically, we first propose a novel supervised linkage module to incorporate the available annotations. Each social identity is represented by a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space to simultaneously preserve the fine-grained social profiles and model the uncertainty of identities. Then, a noise-aware self-learning module is designed to faithfully augment the few available annotations, which is capable of filtering noises from the pseudo-labels generated by the supervised module. The filtered reliable candidates are added into the labeled set to provide enhanced training guidance for the next training iteration. Empirically, we evaluate the NSVUIL model over multiple real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority.

TI Expanding the Edge: Enabling Efficient Winograd CNN Inference With Deep
   Reuse on Edge Device

ID CONVOLUTION
AB Deep learning on edge devices is becoming increasingly important, especially with the explosion of IoT devices. For example, the total number of devices connected to IoT reaches 29 billion in 2022. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as common deep learning representatives, are among the most popular neural networks in knowledge and data engineering. However, CNN employs a high degree of computing. In comparison to the training phase, the inference process is more frequently done on low-power computing equipments, such as edge devices. The limited computing resource and high computation pressure limit the effective use of CNN algorithms at the edge. Fortunately, a minimal filtering algorithm called Winograd can reduce convolution calculations by minimizing multiplication operations. We find that Winograd convolution can be accelerated further by deep reuse technique, which reuses the similar data and computation processes. In this paper, we propose a new inference method, called DREW, which combines deep reuse with Winograd for further accelerating CNNs. DREW handles three difficulties. First, it can detect the similarities from the complex minimal filtering patterns by clustering. Second, it reduces the online clustering cost in a reasonable range. Third, it provides an adjustable method in clustering granularity balancing the performance and accuracy. We perform evaluation on Raspberry PI and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge devices, and experiments show that on five popular networks, 1) DREW further accelerates the Winograd convolution by an average of 8.27x speedup. Even for the highly parallel Winograd implementation, DREW still can provide 2.21x speedup. 2) When DREW is applied to end-to-end Winograd CNN inferences, DREW achieves 5.94x the average performance speedup with no ($< $<0.4%) accuracy loss. 3) Energy consumption is an important factor for inference in practice. DREW reduces the number of convolution operations to 10% of the original operations, thus achieving up to 60% energy-efficiency benefits than the original Winograd inference.

ID KINGS
AB A tournament graph is a complete directed graph, which can be used to model a round-robin tournament between n players. In this paper, we address the problem of finding a champion of the tournament, also known as Copeland winner, which is a player that wins the highest number of matches. In detail, we aim to investigate algorithms that find the champion by playing a low number of matches. Solving this problem allows us to speed up several Information Retrieval and Recommender System applications, including question answering, conversational search, etc. Indeed, these applications often search for the champion inducing a round-robin tournament among the players by employing a machine learning model to estimate who wins each pairwise comparison. Our contribution, thus, allows finding the champion by performing a low number of model inferences. We prove that any deterministic or randomized algorithm finding a champion with constant success probability requires Omega(ln) comparisons, where l is the number of matches lost by the champion. We then present an asymptotically-optimal deterministic algorithm matching this lower bound without knowing l, and we extend our analysis to three variants of the problem. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive experimental assessment of the proposed algorithms on a question answering task on public data. Results show that our proposed algorithms speed up the retrieval of the champion up to 13x with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithm that perform the full tournament.

AB Visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that reasons over questions on images with knowledge. A prerequisite for VQA is the availability of annotated datasets, while the available datasets have several limitations. 1) The diversity of questions and answers are limited to a few question categories and certain concepts (e.g., objects, relations, actions.) with somewhat mechanical answers. 2) The availability of background knowledge or context information has been disregarded with just images, questions and answers being provided. 3) The timeliness of knowledge has not been examined, though some works may introduce factual or commonsense knowledge bases, e.g., ConceptNet, DBPedia. In this paper, we provide an Event-oriented Visual Question Answering (E-VQA) dataset including free-form questions and answers for real-world event concepts, which provides context information of events as domain knowledge in addition to images. E-VQA consists of 2,690 social media images, 9,088 questions, 5,479 answers, and 1,157 news media articles for references being annotated to 182 real-world events, covering a wide range of topics, such as armed conflicts and attacks, disasters and accidents, law and crime. For comparisons, we investigate 10 state-of-the-art VQA methods as benchmarks.

ID ALGORITHM; GENERATION; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS
AB High utility itemsets can reveal combinations of items that have a high profit, expense, or importance. Mining high utility itemsets in a database with n items generally results in a huge search space, composed of 2(n )itemsets, and heavy utility calculations for the explored itemsets. Previous algorithms using prefix tree structures perform two phases, namely candidate generation and testing. To avoid generating candidate itemsets, one-phase algorithms use list or hyper-link structures and have been proven to be superior to two-phase algorithms. However, it should be noted that a prefix tree is still an efficient structure for itemset mining problems, and especially algorithms using prefix trees such as FP-Growth have shown excellent performance for mining frequent itemsets. This paper proposes Hamm, a High-performance AlgorithM for Mining high utility itemsets. Hamm employs a novel TV (prefix Tree and utility Vector) structure and mines high utility itemsets in one phase without candidate generation. We also develop an efficient optimization which is incorporated into Hamm as a component. Using prefix trees and utility vectors, Hamm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various databases in experiments. Experimental results also show that the proposed optimization remarkably reduces the search space and speeds up Hamm.

AB Region similarity learning plays an essential role in applications such as business site selection, region recommendation, and urban planning. Earlier studies mainly represent regions as bags of points of interest (POIs) for region similarity comparisons, which cannot fully exploit the spatial features of the regions. Recently, researchers propose to use deep neural networks to exploit spatial features such as POI geo-coordinates and categories, which have produced more accurate and robust region similarity learning results. However, many useful features such as the height and size of a POI, and the distance and relative importance between the POIs, are still overlooked in these methods. To take advantage of such features, we propose to represent regions as graphs, where nodes are POIs with rich features such as height, size, and hexagonal coordinates, while edges are the relationships between POIs formulated by their road network distances. To capture POIs' importance, we weigh them by their height and size. Since there is limited availability of ground-truth region similarity data, we propose a contrastive learning-based multi-relational graph neural network (C-MPGCN) for region similarity learning based on the graph representations. To generate data for model training, we propose a soft graph edit distance (SGED) based algorithm to generate triples of similar and dissimilar graphs of a given graph (representing a given region) based on the POI weights. Experimental results show that C-MPGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for region similarity learning consistently with an improvement of at least 8.6% and 9.4% in terms of MRR and HR@1, respectively.

TI Adaptive Consensus Clustering for Multiple K-Means Via Base Results

DE Consensus clustering; graph filter; multiple k-means
ID QUALITY
AB Consensus clustering, which learns a consensus clustering result from multiple weak base results, has been widely studied. However, conventional consensus clustering methods only focus on the ensemble process while ignoring the quality improvement of the base results, and thus they just use the fixed base results for consensus learning. In this paper, we provide an alternative idea to improve the final consensus clustering performance by considering the base results refining. In our framework, we adaptively refine the base results in the process of the ensemble. In more detail, on one hand, we ensemble multiple K-means results to learn the consensus one by considering the consensus and diversity; on the other hand, we apply the consensus result to design a graph filter to learn a more cluster-friendly embedding for refining the base K-means results. In our framework, the consensus learning and base results refining are integrated into one unified objective function so that these two tasks can be boosted by each other. Then we design an effective iterative algorithm to optimize the carefully designed objective function. The extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform both the single clustering and the state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods.

   recommender system
AB In recent years, the multi-task learning for knowledge graph-based recommender system, termed MKR, has shown its promising performance and has attracted increasing interest, because a recommendation task and a knowledge graph embedding (KGE) task can help each other to improve the recommendation. However, MKR still has two difficult issues. The first is how fully to capture users' historical behavior pattern in the recommendation task and how fully to utilize deep multi-relation semantic information in the KGE task. The second is how to deal with datasets with different sparsity. Tackling these challenging issues, this paper proposes an enhanced MKR (EMKR) approach with two novelties. First, we propose to utilize the attention mechanism to aggregate users' historical behavior for more accurately mining preferences in the recommendation task, and utilize the relation-aware graph convolutional neural network to fully capture the deep multi-relation neighborhood features in the KGE task, so as to address the first issue. Second, a two-part modeling strategy is proposed for a better representation of users in the recommendation task to expand the expressive ability of the model for adapting to datasets with different sparsity, so as to address the second issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-used datasets and 11 approaches are used for comparison. The results show that the proposed EMKR can achieve substantial gains over the compared state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the situation where user-item interactions are sparse.

AB In the past decade, many approaches have been suggested to execute ML workloads on a DBMS. However, most of them have looked at in-DBMS ML from a training perspective, whereas ML inference has been largely overlooked. We think that this is an important gap to fill for two main reasons: (1) in the near future, every application will be infused with some sort of ML capability; (2) behind every web page, application, and enterprise there is a DBMS, whereby in-DBMS inference is an appealing solution both for efficiency (e.g., less data movement), performance (e.g., cross-optimizations between relational operators and ML) and governance. In this article, we study whether DBMSs are a good fit for prediction serving. We introduce a technique for translating trained ML pipelines containing both featurizers (e.g., one-hot encoding) and models (e.g., linear and tree-based models) into SQL queries, and we compare in-DBMS performance against popular ML frameworks such as Sklearn and ml.net. Our experiments show that, when pushed inside a DBMS, trained ML pipelines can have performance comparable to ML frameworks in several scenarios, while they perform quite poorly on text featurization and over (even simple) neural networks.

AB The wide spread of rumors inflicts damages on social media platforms. Detecting rumors has become an emerging problem concerning the public and government. A crucial problem for rumors detection on social media is the lack of reliably pre-annotated dataset to train classification models. To solve this problem, we propose an unsupervised model that detects rumors by measuring how well the tweets follow the normal patterns. However, the problem is challenging in how to automatically discover the normal patterns of tweets. To tackle the challenge, we first propose a novel tree variational autoencoder model that reconstructs the sentiment labels along the propagation tree of a factual tweet. Then we propose a cross-alignment method to align the multiple modalities, i.e., tree structure and propagation features, and output the final prediction results. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset collected from Weibo. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and adapts better to the concept drift than state-of-the-art supervised methods.

ID SIMILARITY-BASED METHODS
AB The decomposition of a time series is an essential task that helps to understand its very nature. It facilitates the analysis and forecasting of complex time series expressing various hidden components such as the trend, seasonal components, cyclic components and irregular fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial in many fields for forecasting and decision-making processes. In recent years, many methods of time series decomposition have been developed, which extract and reveal different time series properties. Unfortunately, they neglect a very important property, i.e., time series variance. To deal with heteroscedasticity in time series, the method proposed in this work - a seasonal-trend-dispersion decomposition (STD) - extracts the trend, seasonal component and component related to the dispersion of the time series. We define STD decomposition in two ways: with and without an irregular component. We show how STD can be used for time series analysis and forecasting.

ID COVARIANCE ESTIMATION; GRAPHS; INFORMATION
AB Joint network topology inference represents a canonical problem of jointly learning multiple graph Laplacian matrices from heterogeneous graph signals. In such a problem, a widely employed assumption is that of a simple common component shared among multiple graphs. However, in practice, a more intricate topological pattern, comprising simultaneously of homogeneous and heterogeneous components, would exhibit in multiple graphs. In this paper, we propose a general graph estimator based on a novel structural fusion regularization that enables us to jointly learn multiple graphs with such complex topological patterns, and enjoys rigorous theoretical guarantees. Specifically, in the proposed regularization term, the structural similarity among graphs is characterized by a Gram matrix, which enables us to flexibly model different types of network structural similarities through different Gram matrix choices. Algorithmically, the regularization term, coupling the parameters together, makes the formulated optimization problem intractable, and thus, we develop an implementable algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. Theoretically, non-asymptotic statistical analysis is provided, which precisely characterizes the minimum sample size required for the consistency of the graph estimator. This analysis also provides high-probability bounds on the estimation error as a function of graph structural similarities and other key problem parameters. Finally, the superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulated and real data examples.

ID INDEXES
AB As key components of DBMSs, various storage engines and index structures have been proposed based on incorrect assumptions before PMem hardware is publicly available. Recent studies reveal that there is a significant performance gap in evaluating index structures on real PMem platforms as compared to DRAM-based emulators. However, a comprehensive evaluation for those PMem-aware database storage engines on real PMem hardware is still missing. Meanwhile, dynamic memory management is more important on PMem systems because PMem is slower than DRAM and unfriendly to random small-writes, and ensuring crash-consistency for the metadata of PMem allocators introduces extra overhead. Therefore, it is essential to understand the performance intricacies of PMem-aware database storage engines from the perspective of PMem allocators. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of three PMem-aware database storage engines using representative workloads and a unified benchmarking framework that is integrated with four PMem allocators. Besides the commonly used metrics, the impact of different hardware configurations (such as NUMA and eADR) on performance is also considered. Through in-depth analysis, we reveal caveats and pitfalls on using or designing PMem-aware storage engines and important insights that can serve as guidelines for future development of PMem allocators and other related components.

DT Article
DE Cross-domain recommendation; deep learning; recommendation system;
   variational autoencoder
AB The core idea of cross-domain recommendation is to alleviate the problem of data scarcity. Previous methods have made brilliant successes. However, many of them mainly focus on learning an ideal mapping function across-domains, ignoring the user preferences within a specific domain, which leads to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Domain Recommendation Variational AutoEncoder framework (CDRVAE), a novel extension of a variational autoencoder on cross-domain recommendations for user behaviour distribution modeling. It applies a new hybrid architecture of VAE as the backbone and simultaneously constructs two information flows, within-domain and cross-domain modeling. For the former, an asymmetric codec structure is designed to reconstruct preference distribution from domain-specific latent factors. To relieve the posterior collapse dilemma, a combined prior is employed to increase the distribution complexity. The equivalent transition by a transformation matrix and the unobserved interaction generation by cross-domain reconstruction contribute to the latter. We combine all the above components for the more accurate and reliable user features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CDRVAE. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRVAE is consistently superior to other state-of-the-art alternative baseline models.

AB Multi-view clustering aims at integrating information from different views to improve clustering performance. Recent methods integrate multiple view-specific partition matrices to seek a consensus one and have demonstrated promising clustering performance in various applications. However, the clustering performance of such methods heavily relies on the consensus partition matrix estimated by the arithmetic mean in euclidean space and thus is highly susceptible to noise corruption. To this end, this article proposes to learn a consensus partition matrix through the geometric mean on the manifold to achieve robust clustering. Specifically, the multiple view-specific partition matrices can be regarded as points residing in the Stiefel manifold and enable a manifold-based integration. Consequently, the view-specific partition matrices are integrated by estimating a consensus partition matrix as the center point on the Stiefel manifold. Such a partition integration boils down to the Frechet mean problem on a manifold, which is solved by the intrinsic manifold-based optimization and proves effective in providing a more robust estimation against noise. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and noise-robustness of our proposed method in comparison to eight competitive methods.

ID MODEL
AB Graph matching endeavors to find corresponding nodes across two or more graphs, which plays a fundamental role in many vision and pattern matching tasks. However, existing graph matching algorithms often meet abnormal graphs with missing node features and suffer from numerous cluttered outliers in practical applications. To address these, we propose a novel deep graph matching method called Random Deep Graph Matching (RDGM). Different from the deterministic affinity inference in existing deep graph matching methods, RDGM performs message passing in a random manner during model training through randomly masking some available node features in the source or target graph, so that the affinity inference between nodes is insensitive to specific neighborhoods. In addition, a hierarchical attention graph neural network framework is devised in the node embedding process of RDGM, which can obtain more sufficient high-order structural information to reduce the impact of latent noise on affinity learning. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed RDGM outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching methods, and demonstrates strong robustness and generalization performance.

TI Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection Via Neural Process

DT Article
DE Anomaly detection; neural networks; neural process; probabilistic
   models; semi-supervised learning
AB Many deep (semi-) supervised neural network-based methods have been proposed for anomaly detection, tackling the issue of limited labeled data. They have shown good performance but still face two major challenges. First, insufficient labeled data limits their flexibility. Second, measuring the uncertainty of the prediction, especially when dealing with objects deviating largely from training data, has not been well studied. Another common reason preventing them from prevailing is that they learn a determined function to make predictions from the input. This usually makes the predicted results uncertain and lacks robustness. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework, incorporating the neural process into the semi-supervised anomaly detection paradigm and efficiently using unlabeled data and a handful of labeled data in training. Different from other methods, ours is equivalent to modeling the distribution of functions representing anomalous patterns according to the labeled data rather than learning a single determined function for anomaly detection. Our approach improves the flexibility and robustness under the condition of insufficient training data, and can measure the uncertainty of prediction results. Extensive experiments under real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve anomaly detection performance compared to several cutting-edge benchmarks.

AB Supporting efficient and secure location-based skyline queries on encrypted data, such as private data outsourced to cloud-based systems, remains an ongoing challenge for efficiency due to significant computational costs in the ciphertext domain. To accelerate privacy-preserving skyline queries, the secure index intuitively contributes to an increase in efficiency. However, designing such a secure index is a challenge while protecting the unlinkability of queries. Meanwhile, there exist little work that can commendably assure efficiency and security. In this paper, we demonstrate SecSky, an efficient solution for supporting secure location-based skyline queries through the secure index. To support SecSky, we devise a novel unified structure, named secure R-tree (SR-tree) index, without privacy leakage (especially indirect privacy). Subsequently, we propose a novel secure location-based dominance protocol, which is utilized to calculate the dominance relationship on the SR-tree. Using this protocol as the building block, our secure location-based skyline query protocol integrates SR-tree, permutation and perturbation techniques to facilitate query processing so as to dramatically reduce the computational overhead. Meanwhile, our proposed solution avoids compromising the privacy of datasets, queries, dominance relationship and skyline results. Finally, we analyze the complexity and security of SecSky. Findings from the experimental evaluation show that our proposed scheme outperforms several other protocols by at least 3 orders of magnitude in terms of query efficiency.

DE Entity alignment; knowledge graph; network alignment
ID NETWORKS
AB Entity alignment is a vital task in knowledge fusion, which aims to align entities from different knowledge graphs and merge them into one single graph. Existing entity alignment models focus on local features and try to minimize the distance between pairs of pre-aligned entities. Despite their success, these models heavily rely on the number of existing pre-aligned entity pairs and the topology information from the rest large set of unaligned entities is still largely unexplored. To overcome the limitation of existing models, we propose a model, termed Global Alignment and Local Information Aggregation, or GALA. GALA constructs global features for the knowledge graphs to be aligned using entity embeddings. It aligns the entities in the graphs by forcing their global features to match with each other and progressively updating the entity embeddings by aggregating local information from the other network. Empirical studies on commonly-used KG alignment data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB Graphs are widely used to model complex structured data in many applications. With the proliferation of cloud computing, it is popular to store and query graphs in the cloud. Among others, graph similarity search, which aims to retrieve from a graph database graphs similar to a query graph, has received wide attentions and benefited various domains such as cheminformatics, computer vision, and more. Deploying graph similarity search services on the cloud, however, raises critical privacy concerns on the information-rich graphs. In this article, we initiate the first study on privacy-preserving graph similarity search in cloud computing. We design, implement, and evaluate PrigSim, a novel system allowing the cloud to host an outsourced encrypted graph database and support secure graph similarity search, where the graph similarity is measured by the well-known metric called graph edit distance. PrigSim is built from a customized and delicate synergy of insights on graph modelling, lightweight cryptography, and data encoding and padding, providing protections for the confidentiality of data content associated with graphs, as well as hiding the connections among vertices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the security design of PrigSim is accuracy-preserving, and presents modest performance overheads (with 9 x - 15x higher query latency than the plaintext baseline).

TI eShare plus : A Data-Driven Balancing Mechanism for Bike Sharing Systems

DE Bike sharing; maintenance; sharing economy; urban data; usage balancing
AB With the rapid development of sharing economy, we have access to massive sharing systems such as Uber, Airbnb, and bike sharing nowadays. The sharing economy, at its core, is to achieve efficient use of resources. However, the actual usage of shared resources is still unclear to us. Little measurement or analysis, if any, has been conducted to investigate the resource usage patterns with the large-scale data collected from these sharing systems. In this paper, we first analyze the shared bike usage patterns in three typical bike sharing systems based on 140-month multi-event data. From our data-driven analysis, we found that the most used 20% of shared bikes account for 45% of total usage, while the least used 20% of bikes account for less than 1% of usage. To efficiently utilize shared bikes, we propose a usage balancing design called eShare+ to improve the bike sharing systems by considering both the quality of service and bike maintenance, which includes three key components: (i) a statistical model based on archived data to infer historical usage; (ii) an entropy and contextual LSTM-based prediction model with both real-time and archived data to infer future usage; (iii) a model-driven optimal calibration engine for bike selection to dynamically balance usage. We develop an ID swapping-based evaluation methodology to measure the efficiency of eShare+ with data from three large-scale bike sharing systems including 84,000 bikes and 3,300 service stations. Our results show that eShare+ not only fully utilizes shared bikes with efficient maintenance but also improves the quality of service. In addition, eShare+ also has the potential to be applicable to different fleet sizes.

AB In traditional graph embedding methods, graph construction is sensitive to high-dimensional data with noise and outliers, making an effective exploration of the neighborhood structure of the data difficult. Besides, with these methods, constructing graphs and reducing dimensions are disconnected and cannot be mutually optimized. To address these problems, we propose an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method based on bipartite graph, named unsupervised adaptive bipartite graph embedding (UABGE). First, the anchors are generated from the raw data by K-means or random sampling. Second, the bipartite graph, which is constructed between the samples and the anchors in the low-dimensional subspace, utilizes the adaptive allocation method to assign neighbors for each sample, so that the local structure of high-dimensional data can be captured effectively. Third, we present an objective function that combines bipartite graph construction and projection matrix learning to achieve mutual optimization between them, which can be solved with an alternating optimization algorithm. Finally, the computational complexity and the convergence of the algorithm are analyzed. Experimental results on synthetic data and publicly available datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Adaptive Skeleton Construction for Accurate DAG Learning

DE Causal discovery; directed acyclic graph; local skeleton learning;

ID BAYESIAN NETWORKS; INDUCTION
AB Directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning plays a key role in causal discovery and many machine learning tasks. Learning a DAG from high-dimensional data always faces scalability problems. A local-to-global DAG learning approach can be scaled to high-dimensional data, however, existing local-to-global DAG learning algorithms employ either the AND-rule or the OR-rule for constructing a DAG skeleton. Simply using either rule, existing local-to-global methods may learn an inaccurate DAG skeleton, leading to unsatisfactory DAG learning performance. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive DAG Learning (ADL) algorithm. The novel contribution of ADL is that it can simultaneously and adaptively use the AND-rule and the OR-rule to construct an accurate global DAG skeleton. We conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that ADL is significantly better than some existing local-to-global and global DAG learning algorithms.

   detection; representation learning
AB Graph anomaly detection is attracting remarkable multidisciplinary research interests ranging from finance, healthcare, and social network analysis. Recent advances on graph neural networks have substantially improved the detection performance via semi-supervised representation learning. However, prior work suggests that deep graph-based methods tend to learn spurious correlations. As a result, they fail to generalize beyond training data distribution. In this article, we aim to identify structural and contextual anomaly nodes in an attributed graph. Based on our preliminary data analyses, spurious correlations can be eliminated with causal subgraph interventions. Therefore, we propose a new graph-based anomaly detection model that can learn causal relations for anomaly detection while generalizing to new environments. To handle situations with varying environments, we steer the generative model to manufacture synthetic environment features, which are exerted on realistic subgraphs to generate counterfactual subgraphs. Further, these counterfactual subgraphs help a few-shot anomaly detection model learn transferable and causal relations across different environments. The experiments on three real-world attributed graphs show that the proposed approach achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and learns robust causal representations resistant to noises and spurious correlations.

AB Imbalanced classification is a challenging task in the fields of machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition. Cost-sensitive online algorithms are very important methods for large-scale imbalanced classification problems. At present, most of the cost-sensitive classification algorithms focus on the accuracy of the minority class and ignore the accuracy of the majority class. In order to better balance the accuracy between the minority class and the majority class, in this article, a misclassification cost is presented to ensure that the cost-sensitive online algorithm can better deal with the imbalanced classification problems without signifificantly reducing the accuracy of the majority class. Based on the proposed misclassification cost, a novel cost-sensitive online adaptive kernel learning algorithm is proposed to boost the adaptability of kernel function when data arrives one by one. According to the essential characteristics of the imbalanced binary classification, a cost-sensitive online adaptive kernel learning algorithm is given to handle the large-scale imbalanced multi-class classification problems. Theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms are provided. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art imbalanced classification algorithms, the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the classification performances on most of the large-scale imbalanced data sets.

AB Subspace clustering has attracted much attention because of its ability to group unlabeled high-dimensional data into multiple subspaces. Existing graph-based subspace clustering methods focus on either the sparsity of data affinity or the low rank of data affinity. Thus, the quality of data affinity plays an essential role in the performance of subspace clustering. However, the real-world data are generally high-dimensional, complex, and heterogeneous multi-source data, so that the data affinity learned by these methods cannot be completely dependent. Moreover, since these approaches always ignore the intrinsic structure of data, their grouping effect is relatively low. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm, called Structure-Aware Subspace Clustering (SASC), to address the above issues. SASC considers local and global correlation structures simultaneously to capture the intrinsic structure. Further, it integrates the captured structure into representation learning to gain a relatively precise data affinity. It is powerful to promote an all-around grouping effect and enhances the robustness and applicability of subspace clustering. Experiments on various benchmark datasets, including bioinformatics, handwritten digit, object image, and speech signal, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Graph mining algorithms have been playing a significant role in myriad fields over the years. However, despite their promising performance on various graph analytical tasks, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. As a consequence, they could lead to discrimination towards certain populations when exploited in human-centered applications. Recently, algorithmic fairness has been extensively studied in graph-based applications. In contrast to algorithmic fairness on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, fairness in graph mining has exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfilling techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction of existing literature under the context of fair graph mining. Specifically, we propose a novel taxonomy of fairness notions on graphs, which sheds light on their connections and differences. We further present an organized summary of existing techniques that promote fairness in graph mining. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming at encouraging cross-breeding ideas and further advances.

TI NMTF-LTM: Towards an Alignment of Semantics for Lifelong Topic Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Lifelong topic modeling; non-negative matrix tri-factorization; semantic
   alignment; parallel computing
AB Aiming at mining high quality topics by accumulating and utilizing semantic knowledge for a stream of documents, lifelong topic modeling (LTM) has attracted more and more attentions recently. However, the permutation of topics may change over time, resulting in a semantic misalignment between the topic representations of document chunks across the stream. Such a misalignment deteriorates the model performances of various downstream tasks, while it has been overlooked by the existing lifelong topic models. Towards addressing the misalignment of semantics, we formulate LTM as a problem of non-negative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) and propose a consolidation framework (i.e., NMTF-LTM) to enforce an alignment in a mapped topic space. In addition, a distributed parallel algorithm, namely PNMTF-LTM, is developed to meet the real-time requirement for large-scale stream processing. Empirical results show that our method can not only obtain a superior alignment of semantics without loss of topic quality, but also achieve effective speedup when deployed to a high performance computing cluster.

AB Online developer communities like GitHub allow a massive number of developers to collaborate. However, the openness of the communities makes them vulnerable to different types of malicious attacks, since attackers can easily join these communities and interact with legitimate users. In this work, we propose GitSec, a deep learning-based solution for detecting malicious accounts in online developer communities. GitSec distinguishes malicious accounts from legitimate ones based on the account profiles, dynamic activity characteristics, as well as social interactions. First, GitSec introduces two user activity sequences and applies a parallel neural network design with an attention mechanism to process the sequences. Second, GitSec constructs two graphs to represent the interactions between users according to their repository operations. Especially, graph neural networks and structural hole theory are employed to deal with the two constructed graphs. Third, GitSec makes use of the descriptive features to enhance the detection performance. The final judgement is made by a decision maker implemented by a supervised machine learning-based classifier. Based on the real-world data of GitHub users, our comprehensive evaluations show that GitSec achieves a better performance than state-of-the-art solutions, with an AUC value of 0.916.

AB Learning with streaming data has attracted extensive research interest in recent years. Existing online learning approaches have specific assumptions regarding data streams, such as requiring fixed or varying feature spaces with explicit patterns and balanced class distributions. While the data streams generated in many real scenarios commonly have arbitrarily incomplete feature spaces and dynamic imbalanced class distributions, making existing approaches be unsuitable for real applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Online Learning from Incomplete and Imbalanced Data Streams (OLI (2) DS) algorithm. OLI 2 DS has a two-fold main idea: 1) it follows the empirical risk minimization principle to identify the most informative features of incomplete feature spaces, and 2) it develops a dynamic cost strategy to handle imbalanced class distributions in real-time by transforming F-measure optimization into a weighted surrogate loss minimization. To evaluate OLI (2) DS, we compare it with stateof-the-art related algorithms in three kinds of experiments. First, we adopt 14 real datasets to simulate three scenarios of incomplete feature spaces, i.e., trapezoidal, feature evolvable, and capricious data streams. Second, based on a benchmark online analyzer, we generate 13 datasets to simulate incomplete data streams with different imbalance ratios. Third, we analyze concept drift in two simulated scenes, i.e., online learning and data stream mining, and verify the adaption of OLI (2) DS on repeated concept drifts and variable imbalance ratios. The results demonstrate that OLI (2) DS achieves a significantly better performance than its rivals. Besides, a real-world case study on movie review classification is conducted to elaborate on our OLI (2) DS algorithm's effectiveness. Code is released at https://github.com/youdianlong/OLI2DS.

AB We study large-scale network embedding with the goal of generating high-quality embeddings for networks with more than 1 billion vertices and 100 billion edges. Recent attempts LightNE and NetSMF propose to sparsify and factorize the (dense) NetMF matrix for embedding large networks, where NetMF is a theoretically-grounded network embedding method. However, there is a trade-off between their embeddings' quality and scalability due to their expensive memory requirements, making embeddings less effective under real-world memory constraints. Therefore, we present the SketchNE model, a scalable, effective, and memory-efficient network embedding solution developed for a single machine with CPU only. The main idea of SketchNE is to avoid the explicit construction and factorization of the NetMF matrix either sparsely or densely when producing the embeddings through the proposed sparse-sign randomized single-pass SVD algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on nine datasets of various sizes for vertex classification and link prediction, demonstrating the consistent outperformance of SketchNE over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. SketchNE costs only 1.0 hours to embed the Hyperlink2012 network with 3.5 billion vertices and 225 billion edges on a CPU-only single machine with embedding superiority (e.g., a 282% relative HITS@10 gain over LightNE).

DE Complementary and consensus information; incomplete multi-view data;
   unsupervised feature selection; weighted non-negative matrix
   factorization
AB unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has been demonstrated as an effective technique to reduce the dimensionality of multi-view unlabeled data. The existing methods assume that all of views are complete. However, multi-view data are usually incomplete, i.e., a part of instances are presented on some views but not all views. Besides, learning the complete similarity graph, as an important promising technology in existing MUFS methods, cannot achieve due to the missing views. In this paper, we propose a complementary and consensus learning-based incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection method ((CIMUFS)-I-2) to address the aforementioned issues. Concretely, (CIMUFS)-I-2 integrates feature selection into an extended weighted non-negative matrix factorization model equipped with adaptive learning of view-weights and a sparse l(2,p)-norm, which can offer better adaptability and flexibility. By the sparse linear combinations of multiple similarity matrices derived from different views, a complementary learning-guided similarity matrix reconstruction model is presented to obtain the complete similarity graph in each view. Furthermore, (CIMUFS)-I-2 learns a consensus clustering indicator matrix across different views and embeds it into a spectral graph term to preserve the local geometric structure. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of (CIMUFS)-I-2 compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Data provenance is any information about the origin of a piece of data and the process that led to its creation. Most database provenance work has focused on creating models and semantics to query and generate this provenance information. While comprehensive, provenance information remains large and overwhelming, making it hard for data provenance systems to support data exploration. We present a new approach to provenance exploration that builds on data summarization techniques. We contribute novel summarization schemes for the provenance of aggregation queries and techniques for the fast generation of these summarization schemes. We introduce two types of summaries for aggregate queries. Impact summaries take into account the impact of specific groups of tuples in the provenance of the query on an aggregate result, and comparative summaries allow users to compare the provenance of two aggregate results. We also present algorithms for efficient computation of these summaries, implement optimizations using data sampling and feature selection, and conduct experiments and a user survey to show the feasibility and relevance of our approaches.

DE Top-k community similarity search; road-network graph
AB With the urbanization and development of infrastructure, the community search over road networks has become increasingly important in many real applications such as urban/city planning, social study on local communities, and community recommendations by real estate agencies. In this article, we propose a novel problem, namely top-k community similarity search (Top-kCS(2)) over road networks, which efficiently and effectively obtains k spatial communities that are the most similar to a given query community in road-network graphs. In order to efficiently and effectively tackle the Top-kCS(2) problem, in this paper, we will design an effective similarity measure between spatial communities, and propose a framework for retrieving Top-kCS(2) query answers, which integrates offline pre-processing and online computation phases. Moreover, we also consider a variant, namely continuous top-k community similarity search (CTop-kCS(2)), where the query community continuously moves along a query line segment. We develop an efficient algorithm to split query line segment into intervals, incrementally obtain similar candidate communities for each interval, and refine actual CTop-kCS(2) query answers. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real and synthetic data sets to confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed Top-kCS(2) and CTop-kCS(2) approaches under various parameter settings.

AB With the diffusion of online mobile devices with geo-location capabilities, the infrastructure necessary for real-world deployment of Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), where so-called mobile workers are assigned location-sensitive tasks, is in place. Some SC tasks cannot be completed by a single worker due to their complexity, but rather must be assigned to and completed by a group of users. Achieving such group assignments that satisfy all group members evenly is an open challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preference-aware group task assignment framework encompassing two components: Mutual Information-based Preference Modeling (MIPM) and Preference-aware Group Task Assignment (PGTA). The MIPM component learns the preferences of groups contrastively by maximizing the mutual information between workers and worker groups based on worker-task and group-task interaction data and by using an attention mechanism to weight group members adaptively. In addition, curriculum negative sampling is adopted to generate a small number of negative workers for each worker group, following the principles of curriculum learning. Next, the PGTA component offers an optimal task assignment algorithm that employs tree decomposition to assign tasks to appropriate worker groups, with the aim of maximizing the number of task assignments while prioritizing more interested groups when assigning tasks. The task assignment framework also features preference-constrained pruning of unpromising worker groups to speed up the assignment process. Finally, we report extensive experiments that offer evidence of the effectiveness and practicality of the paper's proposal.

AB Recently, maximizing mutual information has emerged as a powerful tool for unsupervised graph representation learning. Existing methods are typically effective in capturing graph information from the topology view but consistently ignore the node feature view. To circumvent this problem, we propose a novel method by exploiting mutual information maximization across feature and topology views. Specifically, we first construct the feature graph to capture the underlying structure of nodes in feature spaces by measuring the distance between pairs of nodes. Then we use a cross-view representation learning module to capture both local and global information content across feature and topology views on graphs. To model the information shared by the feature and topology spaces, we develop a common representation learning module by using mutual information maximization and reconstruction loss minimization. Here, minimizing reconstruction loss forces the model to learn the shared information of feature and topology spaces. To explicitly encourage diversity between graph representations from the same view, we also introduce a disagreement regularization to enlarge the distance between representations from the same view. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating feature and topology views. In particular, compared with the previous supervised methods, the proposed method achieves comparable or even better performance under the unsupervised representation and linear evaluation protocol.

AB A fundamental problem in many scenarios is to match entities across two data sources. It is frequently presumed in prior work that entities to be matched are of comparable granularity. In this work, we address one-to-many or poly-matching in the scenario where entities have varying granularity. A distinctive feature of our problem is its bidirectional nature, where the 'one' or the 'many' could come from either source arbitrarily. Moreover, to deal with diverse entity representations that give rise to noisy similarity values, we incorporate novel notions of receptivity and reclusivity into a robust matching objective. As the optimal solution to the resulting formulation is proven computationally intractable, we propose more scalable yet still performant heuristics. Experiments on multiple real-life datasets showcase the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed algorithms over baselines.

ID INFORMATION
AB Given a graph, searching for a community containing a query vertex is a fundamental problem and has found many applications. Most existing community search models are based on non-attributed or vertex-attributed graphs. In many real-world graphs, however, the edges carry the richest information to describe the interactions between vertices; hence, it is important to take the information into account in community search. In this paper, we conduct a pioneer study on the community search on edge-attributed graphs. We proposed the Edge-Attributed Community Search (EACS) problem, which aims to extract a subgraph that contains the given query vertex while its edges have the maximum attribute similarity. We prove that the EACS problem is NP-hard and propose both exact and 2-approximation algorithms to address EACS. Our exact algorithms run up to 2320.34 times faster than the baseline solution. Our approximate algorithms further improve the efficiency by up to 2.93 times. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.

AB Online lot sizing for perishable materials in an uncertain environment is a fundamental problem for inventory planning and has been studied for several decades. In this article, we study a novel setting of the lot sizing problem, considering perishable materials, multiple suppliers, uncertain demands and lead time (LS-PMU), which captures the inventory planning task in real life better than existing lot sizing problems. We present theoretical results of the best possible competitive ratio an online algorithm can achieve for the LS-PMU problem. We then develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm called RL4LS to intelligently choose the supplier and decide the order quantity in each time period. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to verify that RL4LS outperforms existing algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, e.g., RL4LS improves the effectiveness by 44% and runs two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm IBFA.

AB Most existing clustering algorithms require presetting cluster number and often fail to capture complex shapes. Herein, we propose a clustering algorithm by pruning a density-boosting cluster tree of density mounts-DEnsity MOuntains Separation clustering algorithm (DEMOS). A cluster is assumed to be a density-connected area with multiple (or a single) density mounts (i.e., single-peak clusters) and a relatively large dis-connectivity from density-connected areas of higher densities. Based on this assumption, DEMOS can easily detect the number of clusters and robustly reconstruct their complex shapes. It first builds the dataset into a peak graph, where each density peak represents a density mount. A multi-valley-link-based connectivity estimation method is embedded to efficiently estimate the connectivity between density peaks during peak graph building. Then, by applying a new linkage metric designed based on our assumption, DEMOS builds density mounts into a reasonably density-boosting cluster tree. After obtaining a robust center detection in a clarity-enhancing decision graph (i.e., a two-dimensional plot for detecting centers), DEMOS prunes the cluster tree into final clusters to finish clustering. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DEMOS and its applicability to large-scale data clustering.

AB A large amount of high-dimensional and heterogeneous data appear in practical applications, which are often published to third parties for data analysis, recommendations, targeted advertising, and reliable predictions. However, publishing these data may disclose personal sensitive information, resulting in an increasing concern on privacy violations. Privacy-preserving data publishing has received considerable attention in recent years. Unfortunately, the differentially private publication of high dimensional data remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a differentially private high-dimensional data publication mechanism (DP2-Pub) that runs in two phases: a Markov-blanket-based attribute clustering phase and an invariant post randomization (PRAM) phase. Specifically, splitting attributes into several low-dimensional clusters with high intra-cluster cohesion and low inter-cluster coupling helps obtain a reasonable allocation of privacy budget, while a double-perturbation mechanism satisfying local differential privacy facilitates an invariant PRAM to ensure no loss of statistical information and thus significantly preserves data utility. We also extend our DP2-Pub mechanism to the scenario with a semi-honest server which satisfies local differential privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our mechanism can significantly improve the data utility of the published data while satisfying differential privacy.

AB Learning the directed acyclic graph (DAG) among causal variables is a fundamental pre-task in causal discovery. Available DAG learning solutions canonically focus on homogeneous nodes with multiple variables and assume i.i.d. samples, how to learn DAG on typical attributed heterogeneous network (AHN) composed with different types of inter-dependent nodes and diverse attributes is a practical but more difficult task. In this paper, we propose HetDAG to identify DAG among nodes from heterogeneous network. HetDAG first embeds different types of node attributes and aggregates these embeddings as the node's raw representation. Then it uses contrastive learning with prior network structure to explore latent relationships between nodes and update the representation. Next, HetDAG introduces an attention-based DAG learning module that takes node representations as input to search DAG and orient edges between nodes. To the best of our knowledge, HetDAG is the first study to learn DAG on heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments on both semi-synthetic and real data show that HetDAG can learn DAG in an efficacy way and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The results on real biological networks confirm that HetDAG can find out the causal relations between lncRNAs and miRNAs.

TI A Holistically-Guided Decoder for Deep Representation Learning With
   Applications to Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection

   convolution; holistic features; feature pyramids
AB Both high-level and high-resolution feature representations are of great importance in various visual understanding tasks. To acquire high-resolution feature maps with high-level semantic information, one common strategy is to adopt dilated convolutions in the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps, such as the dilatedFCN-based methods for semantic segmentation. However, due to many convolution operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such methods have large computational complexity and memory consumption. To balance the performance and efficiency, there also exist encoder-decoder structures that gradually recover the spatial information by combining multi-level feature maps from a feature encoder, such as the FPN architecture for object detection and the U-Net for semantic segmentation. Although being more efficient, the performances of existing encoder-decoder methods for semantic segmentation are far from comparable with the dilatedFCN-based methods. In this paper, we propose one novel holistically-guided decoder which is introduced to obtain the high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from the encoder. The decoding is achieved via novel holistic codeword generation and codeword assembly operations, which take advantages of both the high-level and low-level features from the encoder features. With the proposed holistically-guided decoder, we implement the EfficientFCN architecture for semantic segmentation and HGD-FPN for object detection and instance segmentation. The EfficientFCN achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 1/3 of their computational costs for semantic segmentation on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K datasets. Meanwhile, the proposed HGD-FPN achieves > 2% higher mean Average Precision (mAP) when integrated into several object detection frameworks with ResNet-50 encoding backbones.

AB recognition is a promising direction in computer vision, but the training of video classification models is much harder than images due to insufficient data and considerable parameters. To get around this, some works strive to explore multimodal cues from RGB-D data. Although improving motion recognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D datasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data augmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the tightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to spatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion, i.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations leads to insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve RGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in this article. In more detail, firstly, we introduce a novel video data augmentation method dubbed ShuffleMix, which acts as a supplement to MixUp, to provide additional temporal regularization for motion recognition. Secondly, a Unified Multimodal De-coupling and multi-stage Re-coupling framework, termed UMDR, is proposed for video representation learning. Finally, a novel cross-modal Complement Feature Catcher (CFCer) is explored to mine potential commonalities features in multimodal information as the auxiliary fusion stream, to improve the late fusion results. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust spatiotemporal representation and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets. Specifically, UMDR achieves unprecedented improvements of ? 4.5% on the Chalearn IsoGD dataset.

TI Adaptive Part Mining for Robust Visual Tracking
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Adaptive part mining; appearance variation; transformer; visual tracking
AB Visual tracking aims to estimate object state in a video sequence, which is challenging when facing drastic appearance changes. Most existing trackers conduct tracking with divided parts to handle appearance variations. However, these trackers commonly divide target objects into regular patches by a hand-designed splitting way, which is too coarse to align object parts well. Besides, a fixed part detector is difficult to partition targets with arbitrary categories and deformations. To address the above issues, we propose a novel adaptive part mining tracker (APMT) for robust tracking via a transformer architecture, including an object representation encoder, an adaptive part mining decoder, and an object state estimation decoder. The proposed APMT enjoys several merits. First, in the object representation encoder, object representation is learned by distinguishing target object from background regions. Second, in the adaptive part mining decoder, we introduce multiple part prototypes to adaptively capture target parts through cross-attention mechanisms for arbitrary categories and deformations. Third, in the object state estimation decoder, we propose two novel strategies to effectively handle appearance variations and distractors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our APMT achieves promising results with high FPS. Notably, our tracker is ranked the first place in the VOT-STb2022 challenge.

TI Bilateral Relation Distillation for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Bilateral relation distillation; weakly supervised learning; temporal
   action localization
AB Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WSTAL), which aims to locate the time interval of actions in an untrimmed video with only video-level action labels, has attracted increasing research interest in the past few years. However, a model trained with such labels will tend to focus on segments that contributions most to the video-level classification, leading to inaccurate and incomplete localization results. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a novel perspective of relation modeling and propose a method dubbed Bilateral Relation Distillation (BRD). The core of our method involves learning representations by jointly modeling the relation at the category and sequence levels. Specifically, category-wise latent segment representations are first obtained by different embedding networks, one for each category. We then distill knowledge obtained from a pre-trained language model to capture the category-level relations, which is achieved by performing correlation alignment and category-aware contrast in an intra- and inter-video manner. To model the relations among segments at the sequence-level, we elaborate a gradient-based feature augmentation method and encourage the learned latent representation of the augmented feature to be consistent with that of the original one. Extensive experiments illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets.

AB Temporal action segmentation tags action labels for every frame in an input untrimmed video containing multiple actions in a sequence. For the task of temporal action segmentation, we propose an encoder-decoder style architecture named C2F-TCN featuring a "coarse-to-fine" ensemble of decoder outputs. The C2F-TCN framework is enhanced with a novel model agnostic temporal feature augmentation strategy formed by the computationally inexpensive strategy of the stochastic max-pooling of segments. It produces more accurate and well-calibrated supervised results on three benchmark action segmentation datasets. We show that the architecture is flexible for both supervised and representation learning. In line with this, we present a novel unsupervised way to learn frame-wise representation from C2F-TCN. Our unsupervised learning approach hinges on the clustering capabilities of the input features and the formation of multi-resolution features from the decoder's implicit structure. Further, we provide first semi-supervised temporal action segmentation results by merging representation learning with conventional supervised learning. Our semi-supervised learning scheme, called "Iterative-Contrastive-Classify (ICC)", progressively improves in performance with more labeled data. The ICC semi-supervised learning in C2F-TCN, with 40% labeled videos, performs similar to fully supervised counterparts.

TI CIPS-3D++: End-to-End Real-Time High-Resolution 3D-Aware GANs for GAN
   Inversion and Stylization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Terms-Generative adversarial networks; GANs; 3Daware; inversion;
   stylization.
AB Style-based GANs achieve state-of-the-art results for generating high-quality images, but lack explicit and precise control over camera poses. Recently proposed NeRF-based GANs have made great progress towards 3D-aware image generation. However, the methods either rely on convolution operators which are not rotationally invariant, or utilize complex yet suboptimal training procedures to integrate both NeRF and CNN sub-structures, yielding un-robust, low-quality images with a large computational burden. This article presents an upgraded version called CIPS3D++, aiming at high-robust, high-resolution and high-efficiency 3D-aware GANs. On the one hand, our basic model CIPS-3D, encapsulated in a style-based architecture, features a shallow NeRF-based 3D shape encoder as well as a deep MLP-based 2D image decoder, achieving robust image generation/editing with rotation-invariance. On the other hand, our proposed CIPS-3D++, inheriting the rotational invariance of CIPS-3D, together with geometric regularization and upsampling operations, encourages high-resolution high-quality image generation/editing with great computational efficiency. Trained on raw single-view images, without any bells and whistles, CIPS-3D++ sets new records for 3Daware image synthesis, with an impressive FID of 3.2 on FFHQ at the 1024 x 1024 resolution. In the meantime, CIPS-3D++ runs efficiently and enjoys a low GPUmemory footprint so that it can be trained end-to-end on high-resolution images directly, in contrast to previous alternate/progressive methods. Based on the infrastructure of CIPS-3D++, we propose a 3D-aware GAN inversion algorithm named FlipInversion, which can reconstruct the 3D object from a single-view image. We also provide a 3D-aware stylization method for real images based on CIPS-3D++ and FlipInversion. In addition, we analyze the problem of mirror symmetry suffered in training, and solve it by introducing an auxiliary discriminator for the NeRF network. Overall, CIPS-3D++ provides a strong base model that can serve as a testbed for transferring GAN-based image editing methods from 2D to 3D.

ID LABEL NOISE
AB Modern deep neural networks can easily overfit to biased training data containing corrupted labels or class imbalance. Sample re-weighting methods are popularly used to alleviate this data bias issue. Most current methods, however, require to manually pre-specify the weighting schemes relying on the characteristics of the investigated problem and training data. This makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practical scenarios, due to their significant complexities and inter-class variations of data bias. To address this issue, we propose a meta-model capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting scheme directly from data. Specifically, by seeing each training class as a separate learning task, our method aims to extract an explicit weighting function with sample loss and task/class feature as input, and sample weight as output, expecting to impose adaptively varying weighting schemes to different sample classes based on their own intrinsic bias characteristics. Extensive experiments substantiate the capability of our method on achieving proper weighting schemes in various data bias cases, like class imbalance, feature-independent and dependent label noises, and more complicated bias scenarios beyond conventional cases. Besides, the task-transferability of the learned weighting scheme is also substantiated, by readily deploying the weighting function learned on relatively smaller-scale CIFAR-10 dataset on much larger-scale full WebVision dataset. The general availability of our method for multiple robust deep learning issues, including partial-label learning, semi-supervised learning and selective classification, has also been validated. Code for reproducing our experiments is available at https://github.com/xjtushujun/CMW-Net.

DT Article
DE Autoencoders; compositional scene representations; image reconstruction;
   neural networks; object-centric learning
AB Visual scenes are composed of visual concepts and have the property of combinatorial explosion. An important reason for humans to efficiently learn from diverse visual scenes is the ability of compositional perception, and it is desirable for artificial intelligence to have similar abilities. Compositional scene representation learning is a task that enables such abilities. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to apply deep neural networks, which have been proven to be advantageous in representation learning, to learn compositional scene representations via reconstruction, advancing this research direction into the deep learning era. Learning via reconstruction is advantageous because it may utilize massive unlabeled data and avoid costly and laborious data annotation. In this survey, we first outline the current progress on reconstruction-based compositional scene representation learning with deep neural networks, including development history and categorizations of existing methods from the perspectives of the modeling of visual scenes and the inference of scene representations; then provide benchmarks, including an open source toolbox to reproduce the benchmark experiments, of representative methods that consider the most extensively studied problem setting and form the foundation for other methods; and finally discuss the limitations of existing methods and future directions of this research topic.

AB Confluence is a novel non-Intersection over Union (IoU) alternative to Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) in bounding box post-processing in object detection. It overcomes the inherent limitations of IoU-based NMS variants to provide a more stable, consistent predictor of bounding box clustering by using a normalized Manhattan Distance inspired proximity metric to represent bounding box clustering. Unlike Greedy and Soft NMS, it does not rely solely on classification confidence scores to select optimal bounding boxes, instead selecting the box which is closest to every other box within a given cluster and removing highly confluent neighboring boxes. Confluence is experimentally validated on the MS COCO and CrowdHuman benchmarks, improving Average Precision by 0.2--2.7% and 1--3.8% respectively and Average Recall by 1.3--9.3 and 2.4--7.3% when compared against Greedy and Soft-NMS variants. Quantitative results are supported by extensive qualitative analysis and threshold sensitivity analysis experiments support the conclusion that Confluence is more robust than NMS variants. Confluence represents a paradigm shift in bounding box processing, with potential to replace IoU in bounding box regression processes.

DE Scene graph generation; structured prediction; mean field variational
   Bayesian; message passing; constrained optimization
AB As a structured prediction task, scene graph generation aims to build a visually-grounded scene graph to explicitly model objects and their relationships in an input image. Currently, the mean field variational Bayesian framework is the de facto methodology used by the existing methods, in which the unconstrained inference step is often implemented by a message passing neural network. However, such formulation fails to explore other inference strategies, and largely ignores the more general constrained optimization models. In this paper, we present a constrained structure learning method, for which an explicit constrained variational inference objective is proposed. Instead of applying the ubiquitous message-passing strategy, a generic constrained optimization method - entropic mirror descent - is utilized to solve the constrained variational inference step. We validate the proposed generic model on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are attractive for energy-constrained use-cases due to their binarized activation, eliminating the need for weight multiplication. However, its lag in accuracy compared to traditional convolutional network networks (CNNs) has limited its deployment. In this paper, we propose CQ+ training (extended "clamped" and "quantized" training), an SNN-compatible CNN training algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Using a 7-layer modified VGG model (VGG-*), we achieved 95.06% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset for equivalent SNNs. The accuracy drop from converting the CNN solution to an SNN is only 0.09% when using a time step of 600. To reduce the latency, we propose a parameterized input encoding method and a threshold training method, which further reduces the time window size to 64 while still achieving an accuracy of 94.09%. For the CIFAR-100 dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 77.27% using the same VGG-* structure and a time window of 500. We also demonstrate the transformation of popular CNNs, including ResNet (basic, bottleneck, and shortcut block), MobileNet v1/2, and Densenet, to SNNs with near-zero conversion accuracy loss and a time window size smaller than 60. The framework was developed in PyTorch and is publicly available.

DT Article
DE Cross domain lifelong learning; catastrophic forgetting; similarity;
   dual siamese network
AB Humans gradually learn a sequence of cross-domain tasks and seldom experience catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, deep neural networks achieve good performance only in specific tasks within a single domain. To equip the network with lifelong learning capabilities, we propose a Cross-Domain Lifelong Learning (CDLL) framework that fully explores task similarities. Specifically, we employ a Dual Siamese Network (DSN) to learn the essential similarity features of tasks across different domains. To further understand similarity information across domains, we introduce a Domain-Invariant Feature Enhancement Module (DFEM) to better extract domain-invariant features. Moreover, we propose a Spatial Attention Network (SAN) that assigns different weights to various tasks based on the learned similarity features. Ultimately, to maximize the use of model parameters for learning new tasks, we propose a Structural Sparsity Loss (SSL) that can make the SAN as sparse as possible while ensuring accuracy. Experimental results show that our method effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting compared with state-of-the-art methods when continuously learning multiple tasks across different domains. It is worth noting that the proposed method scarcely forgets old knowledge while consistently enhancing the performance of learned tasks, more closely aligning with human learning.

AB Existing visual question answering methods often suffer from cross-modal spurious correlations and oversimplified event-level reasoning processes that fail to capture event temporality, causality, and dynamics spanning over the video. In this work, to address the task of event-level visual question answering, we propose a framework for cross-modal causal relational reasoning. In particular, a set of causal intervention operations is introduced to discover the underlying causal structures across visual and linguistic modalities. Our framework, named <bold>C</bold>ross-<bold>M</bold>odal <bold>C</bold>ausal Relat<bold>I</bold>onal <bold>R</bold>easoning (CMCIR), involves three modules: i) Causality-aware Visual-Linguistic Reasoning (CVLR) module for collaboratively disentangling the visual and linguistic spurious correlations via front-door and back-door causal interventions; ii) Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) module for capturing the fine-grained interactions between visual and linguistic semantics; iii) Visual-Linguistic Feature Fusion (VLFF) module for learning the global semantic-aware visual-linguistic representations adaptively. Extensive experiments on four event-level datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CMCIR in discovering visual-linguistic causal structures and achieving robust event-level visual question answering.

ID PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTION; DISTANCE
AB We introduce the HueNet a novel deep learning framework for a differentiable construction of intensity (1D) and joint (2D) histograms and present its applicability to paired and unpaired image-to-image translation problems. The key idea is an innovative technique for augmenting a generative neural network by histogram layers appended to the image generator. These histogram layers allow us to define two new histogram-based loss functions for constraining the structural appearance of the synthesized output image and its color distribution. Specifically, the color similarity loss is defined by the Earth Mover's Distance between the intensity histograms of the network output and a color reference image. The structural similarity loss is determined by the mutual information between the output and a content reference image based on their joint histogram. Although the HueNet can be applied to a variety of image-to-image translation problems, we chose to demonstrate its strength on the tasks of color transfer, exemplar-based image colorization, and edges ? photo, where the colors of the output image are predefined.

AB The interpretability of policies remains an important challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This paper explores interpretable DRL via representing policy by Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming (DILP) and provides a theoretical and empirical study of DILP-based policy learning from an optimization perspective. We first identified a fundamental fact that DILP-based policy learning should be solved as a constrained policy optimization problem. We then proposed to use Mirror Descent for policy optimization (MDPO) to deal with the constraints of DILP-based policies. We derived the closed-form regret bound of MDPO with function approximation, which is helpful to the design of DRL frameworks. Moreover, we studied the convexity of DILP-based policy to further verify the benefits gained from MDPO. Empirically, we experimented MDPO, its on-policy variant, and 3 mainstream policy learning methods, and the results verified our theoretical analysis.

AB Textual logical reasoning, especially question-answering (QA) tasks with logical reasoning, requires awareness of particular logical structures. The passage-level logical relations represent entailment or contradiction between propositional units (e.g., a concluding sentence). However, such structures are unexplored as current QA systems focus on entity-based relations. In this work, we propose logic structural-constraint modeling to solve the logical reasoning QA and introduce discourse-aware graph networks (DAGNs). The networks first construct logic graphs leveraging in-line discourse connectives and generic logic theories, then learn logic representations by end-to-end evolving the logic relations with an edge-reasoning mechanism and updating the graph features. This pipeline is applied to a general encoder, whose fundamental features are joined with the high-level logic features for answer prediction. Experiments on three textual logical reasoning datasets demonstrate the reasonability of the logical structures built in DAGNs and the effectiveness of the learned logic features. Moreover, zero-shot transfer results show the features' generality to unseen logical texts.

AB Generative data-free quantization emerges as a practical compression approach that quantizes deep neural networks to low bit-width without accessing the real data. This approach generates data utilizing batch normalization (BN) statistics of the full-precision networks to quantize the networks. However, it always faces the serious challenges of accuracy degradation in practice. We first give a theoretical analysis that the diversity of synthetic samples is crucial for the data-free quantization, while in existing approaches, the synthetic data completely constrained by BN statistics experimentally exhibit severe homogenization at distribution and sample levels. This paper presents a generic <bold>D</bold>iverse <bold>S</bold>ample <bold>G</bold>eneration (<bold>DSG</bold>) scheme for the generative data-free quantization, to mitigate detrimental homogenization. We first slack the statistics alignment for features in the BN layer to relax the distribution constraint. Then, we strengthen the loss impact of the specific BN layers for different samples and inhibit the correlation among samples in the generation process, to diversify samples from the statistical and spatial perspectives, respectively. Comprehensive experiments show that for large-scale image classification tasks, our DSG can consistently quantization performance on different neural architectures, especially under ultra-low bit-width. And data diversification caused by our DSG brings a general gain to various quantization-aware training and post-training quantization approaches, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness.

TI Dual Compensation Residual Networks for Class Imbalanced Learning

LA English
DT Article

ID SMOTE
AB Learning generalizable representation and classifier for class-imbalanced data is challenging for data-driven deep models. Most studies attempt to re-balance the data distribution, which is prone to overfitting on tail classes and underfitting on head classes. In this work, we propose Dual Compensation Residual Networks to better fit both tail and head classes. First, we propose dual Feature Compensation Module (FCM) and Logit Compensation Module (LCM) to alleviate the overfitting issue. The design of these two modules is based on the observation: an important factor causing overfitting is that there is severe feature drift between training and test data on tail classes. In details, the test features of a tail category tend to drift towards feature cloud of multiple similar head categories. So FCM estimates a multi-mode feature drift direction for each tail category and compensate for it. Furthermore, LCM translates the deterministic feature drift vector estimated by FCM along intra-class variations, so as to cover a larger effective compensation space, thereby better fitting the test features. Second, we propose a Residual Balanced Multi-Proxies Classifier (RBMC) to alleviate the under-fitting issue. Motivated by the observation that re-balancing strategy hinders the classifier from learning sufficient head knowledge and eventually causes underfitting, RBMC utilizes uniform learning with a residual path to facilitate classifier learning. Comprehensive experiments on Long-tailed and Class-Incremental benchmarks validate the efficacy of our method.

TI Experimental Design for Overparameterized Learning With Application to
   Single Shot Deep Active Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Statistical learning
AB The impressive performance exhibited by modern machine learning models hinges on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data. However, since access to large volumes of labeled data is often limited or expensive, it is desirable to alleviate this bottleneck by carefully curating the training set. Optimal experimental design is a well-established paradigm for selecting data point to be labeled so to maximally inform the learning process. Unfortunately, classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses on selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized (and thus, non-interpolative) models, while modern machine learning models such as deep neural networks are overparameterized, and oftentimes are trained to be interpolative. As such, classical experimental design methods are not applicable in many modern learning setups. Indeed, the predictive performance of underparameterized models tends to be variance dominated, so classical experimental design focuses on variance reduction, while the predictive performance of overparameterized models can also be, as is shown in this paper, bias dominated or of mixed nature. In this paper we propose a design strategy that is well suited for overparameterized regression and interpolation, and we demonstrate the applicability of our method in the context of deep learning by proposing a new algorithm for single shot deep active learning.

ID ALGORITHM; MOTION
AB This paper addresses the problem of rolling shutter correction (RSC) in uncalibrated videos. Existing works remove rolling shutter (RS) distortion by explicitly computing the camera motion and depth as intermediate products, followed by motion compensation. In contrast, we first show that each distorted pixel can be implicitly rectified back to the corresponding global shutter (GS) projection by rescaling its optical flow. Such a point-wise RSC is feasible with both perspective and non-perspective cases without the pre-knowledge of the camera used. Besides, it allows a pixel-wise varying direct RS correction (DRSC) framework that handles locally varying distortion caused by various sources, such as camera motion, moving objects, and even highly varying depth scenes. More importantly, our approach is an efficient CPU-based solution that enables undistorting RS videos in real-time (40fps for 480p). We evaluate our approach across a broad range of cameras and video sequences, including fast motion, dynamic scenes, and non-perspective lenses, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. We also evaluated the ability of the RSC results to serve for downstream 3D analysis, such as visual odometry and structure-from-motion, which verifies preference for the output of our algorithm over other existing RSC methods.

AB In this article, we focus on performing few-shot learning (FSL) under multi-agent scenarios in which participating agents only have scarce labeled data and need to collaborate to predict labels of query observations. We aim at designing a coordination and learning framework in which multiple agents, such as drones and robots, can collectively perceive the environment accurately and efficiently under limited communication and computation conditions. We propose a metric-based multi-agent FSL framework which has three main components: an efficient communication mechanism that propagates compact and fine-grained query feature maps from query agents to support agents; an asymmetric attention mechanism that computes region-level attention weights between query and support feature maps; and a metric-learning module which calculates the image-level relevance between query and support data fast and accurately. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed ranking-based feature learning module, which can fully utilize the order information of training data by maximizing the inter-class distance, while minimizing the intra-class distance explicitly. We perform extensive numerical studies and demonstrate that our approach can achieve significantly improved accuracy in visual and acoustic perception tasks such as face identification, semantic segmentation, and sound genre recognition, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-20%.

AB Due to the manufacturing imperfections, nonuniformities are ubiquitous in digital sensors, causing the notorious Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN). The ability of modern digital cameras to take images under low-light environments is severely limited by the FPN. This paper proposes a novel semi-calibration-based method for the FPN removal that utilizes a pre-calibrated Noise Pattern. The key observation of this work is that the FPN in each shot is actually a scaled Noise Pattern with an unknown scale parameter, since each pixel in the array generates a characteristic amount of dark current which is fundamentally determined by its physical properties. Given a noised image and the corresponding Noise Pattern, the scale parameter is automatically estimated, and then the FPN is removed by subtracting the scaled Noise Pattern from the noised image. The estimation of the scale parameter is based on an entropy minimization estimator, which is derived from the Maximum Likelihood principle and is further justified by subsequent analysis that minimizing the entropy uniquely identifies the true parameter. Convergence issues, as well as the optimality of the proposed estimator, are also theoretically discussed. Finally, some applications are given, illustrating the performance of the proposed FPN removal method in real-world tasks.

AB Pre-training on large-scale datasets has played an increasingly significant role in computer vision and natural language processing recently. However, as there exist numerous application scenarios that have distinctive demands such as certain latency constraints and specialized data distributions, it is prohibitively expensive to take advantage of large-scale pre-training for per-task requirements. we focus on two fundamental perception tasks (object detection and semantic segmentation) and present a complete and flexible system named GAIA-Universe(GAIA), which could automatically and efficiently give birth to customized solutions according to heterogeneous downstream needs through data union and super-net training. GAIA is capable of providing powerful pre-trained weights and searching models that conform to downstream demands such as hardware constraints, computation constraints, specified data domains, and telling relevant data for practitioners who have very few datapoints on their tasks. With GAIA, we achieve promising results on COCO, Objects365, Open Images, BDD100 k, and UODB which is a collection of datasets including KITTI, VOC, WiderFace, DOTA, Clipart, Comic, and more. Taking COCO as an example, GAIA is able to efficiently produce models covering a wide range of latency from 16 ms to 53 ms, and yields AP from 38.2 to 46.5 without whistles and bells. GAIA is released at https://github.com/GAIA-vision.

ID HISTOGRAMS; CONSENSUS
AB Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. Outdoor LiDAR point clouds are typically large-scale and complexly distributed, which makes the registration challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient hierarchical network named HRegNet for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud registration. Instead of using all points in the point clouds, HRegNet performs registration on hierarchically extracted keypoints and descriptors. The overall framework combines the reliable features in deeper layer and the precise position information in shallower layers to achieve robust and precise registration. We present a correspondence network to generate correct and accurate keypoints correspondences. Moreover, bilateral consensus and neighborhood consensus are introduced for keypoints matching, and novel similarity features are designed to incorporate them into the correspondence network, which significantly improves the registration performance. In addition, we design a consistency propagation strategy to effectively incorporate spatial consistency into the registration pipeline. The whole network is also highly efficient since only a small number of keypoints are used for registration. Extensive experiments are conducted on three large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets to demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed HRegNet. The source code of the proposed HRegNet is available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/HRegNet2.

DT Article
DE Consistency-aware learning; logical reasoning; human interaction
   understanding; graph neural network
AB Compared with the progress made on human activity classification, much less success has been achieved on human interaction understanding (HIU). Apart from the latter task is much more challenging, the main causation is that recent approaches learn human interactive relations via shallow graphical representations, which are inadequate to model complicated human interactive-relations. This paper proposes a deep consistency-aware framework aiming at tackling the grouping and labelling inconsistencies in HIU. This framework consists of three components, including a backbone CNN to extract image features, a factor graph network to implicitly learn higher-order consistencies among labelling and grouping variables, and a consistency-aware reasoning module to explicitly enforcing consistencies. The last module is inspired by our key observation that the consistency-aware reasoning bias can be embedded into an energy function or a particular loss function, minimizing which delivers consistent predictions. An efficient mean-field inference algorithm is proposed, such that all modules of our network could be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed consistency-learning modules complement each other, and both make considerable contributions in achieving leading performance on three benchmarks of HIU. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is further validated by experiments on detecting human-object interactions.

TI Influence-Driven Data Poisoning for Robust Recommender Systems

DT Article
DE Adversarial training; poisoning attacks; recommender systems
AB Recent studies have shown that recommender systems are vulnerable, and it is easy for attackers to inject well-designed malicious profiles into the system, resulting in biased recommendations. We cannot deprive these data's injection right and deny their existence's rationality, making it imperative to study recommendation robustness. Despite impressive emerging work, threat assessment of the bi-level poisoning problem and the imperceptibility of poisoning users remain key challenges to be solved. To this end, we propose Infmix, an efficient poisoning attack strategy. Specifically, Infmix consists of an influence-based threat estimator and a user generator, Usermix. First, the influence-based estimator can efficiently evaluate the user's harm to the recommender system without retraining, which is challenging for existing attacks. Second, Usermix, a distribution-agnostic generator, can generate unnoticeable fake data even with a few known users. Under the guidance of the threat estimator, Infmix can select the users with large attacking impacts from the quasi-real candidates generated by Usermix. Extensive experiments demonstrate Infmix's superiority by attacking six recommendation systems with four real datasets. Additionally, we propose a novel defense strategy, adversarial poisoning training (APT). It mimics the poisoning process by injecting fake users (ERM users) committed to minimizing empirical risk to build a robust system. Similar to Infmix, we also utilize the influence function to solve the bi-level optimization challenge of generating ERM users. Although the idea of "fighting fire with fire" in APT seems counterintuitive, we prove its effectiveness in improving recommendation robustness through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.

AB As a front-burner problem in incremental learning, class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is plagued by catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift. Although recent methods have utilized knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the old model, they are still unable to avoid pixel confusion, which results in severe misclassification after incremental steps due to the lack of annotations for past and future classes. Meanwhile data-replay-based approaches suffer from storage burdens and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose to address CISS without exemplar memory and resolve catastrophic forgetting as well as semantic drift synchronously. We present Inherit with Distillation and Evolve with Contrast (IDEC), which consists of a Dense Knowledge Distillation on all Aspects (DADA) manner and an Asymmetric Region-wise Contrastive Learning (ARCL) module. Driven by the devised dynamic class-specific pseudo-labelling strategy, DADA distils intermediate-layer features and output-logits collaboratively with more emphasis on semantic-invariant knowledge inheritance. ARCL implements region-wise contrastive learning in the latent space to resolve semantic drift among known classes, current classes, and unknown classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple CISS tasks by state-of-the-art performance, including Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K and ISPRS datasets. Our method also shows superior anti-forgetting ability, particularly in multi-step CISS tasks.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-based Embodied Question Answering (K-EQA) task, in which the agent intelligently explores the environment to answer various questions with the knowledge. Different from explicitly specifying the target object in the question as existing EQA work, the agent can resort to external knowledge to understand more complicated question such as "Please tell me what are objects used to cut food in the room?", in which the agent must know the knowledge such as "knife is used for cutting food". To address this K-EQA problem, a novel framework based on neural program synthesis reasoning is proposed, where the joint reasoning of the external knowledge and 3D scene graph is performed to realize navigation and question answering. Especially, the 3D scene graph can provide the memory to store the visual information of visited scenes, which significantly improves the efficiency for the multi-turn question answering. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed framework is capable of answering more complicated and realistic questions in the embodied environment. The proposed method is also applicable to multi-agent scenarios.

TI LARNeXt: End-to-End Lie Algebra Residual Network for Face Recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DE Face recognition; lie algebra; pose estimation; profile face
AB Face recognition has always been courted in computer vision and is especially amenable to situations with significant variations between frontal and profile faces. Traditional techniques make great strides either by synthesizing frontal faces from sizable datasets or by empirical pose invariant learning. In this paper, we propose a completely integrated embedded end-to-end Lie algebra residual architecture (LARNeXt) to achieve pose robust face recognition. First, we explore how the face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep feature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and prove that face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual component in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the rotation. Second, on the basis of this theoretical finding, we further design three critical subnets to leverage a soft regression subnet with novel multi-fusion attention feature aggregation for efficient pose estimation, a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face images, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the strength of the residual component that contributes to the feature learning process. Finally, we conduct a large number of ablation experiments, and our quantitative and visualization results both corroborate the credibility of our theory and corresponding network designs. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on frontal-profile face datasets, general unconstrained face recognition datasets, and industrial-grade tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.

AB Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) is of increasing importance in the community of computer vision as its extensive applications and low manual cost. Most of the advanced WSOD approaches build upon an indefinite and quality-agnostic framework, leading to unstable and incomplete object detectors. This paper attributes these issues to the process of inconsistent learning for object variations and the unawareness of localization quality and constructs a novel end-to-end Invariant and Equivariant Network (IENet). It is implemented with a flexible multi-branch online refinement, to be naturally more comprehensive-perceptive against various objects. Specifically, IENet first performs label propagation from the predicted instances to their transformed ones in a progressive manner, achieving affine-invariant learning. Meanwhile, IENet also naturally utilizes rotation-equivariant learning as a pretext task and derives an instance-level rotation-equivariant branch to be aware of the localization quality. With affine-invariance learning and rotation-equivariant learning, IENet urges consistent and holistic feature learning for WSOD without additional annotations. On the challenging datasets of both natural scenes and aerial scenes, we substantially boost WSOD to new state-of-the-art performance. The codes have been released at: https://github.com/XiaoxFeng/IENet.

AB Several real-world problems, like molecular biology and chemical reactions, have hidden graphs, and we need to learn the hidden graph using edge-detecting samples. In this problem, the learner receives examples explaining whether a set of vertices induces an edge of the hidden graph. This article examines the learnability of this problem using the PAC and Agnostic PAC learning models. By computing the VC-dimension of hypothesis spaces of hidden graphs, hidden trees, hidden connected graphs, and hidden planar graphs through edge-detecting samples, we also find the sample complexity of learning these spaces. We study the learnability of this space of hidden graphs in two cases, namely for known and unknown vertex sets. We show that the class of hidden graphs is uniformly learnable when the vertex set is known. Furthermore, we prove that the family of hidden graphs is not uniformly learnable but is nonuniformly learnable when the vertex set is unknown.

AB Inferring the unseen attribute-object composition is critical to make machines learn to decompose and compose complex concepts like people. Most existing methods are limited to the composition recognition of single-attribute-object, and can hardly learn relations between the attributes and objects. In this paper, we propose an attribute-object semantic association graph model to learn the complex relations and enable knowledge transfer between primitives. With nodes representing attributes and objects, the graph can be constructed flexibly, which realizes both single- and multi-attribute-object composition recognition. In order to reduce mis-classifications of similar compositions (e.g., scratched screen and broken screen), driven by the contrastive loss, the anchor image feature is pulled closer to the corresponding label feature and pushed away from other negative label features. Specifically, a novel balance loss is proposed to alleviate the domain bias, where a model prefers to predict seen compositions. In addition, we build a large-scale Multi-Attribute Dataset (MAD) with 116,099 images and 8,030 label categories for inferring unseen multi-attribute-object compositions. Along with MAD, we propose two novel metrics Hard and Soft to give a comprehensive evaluation in the multi-attribute setting. Experiments on MAD and two other single-attribute-object benchmarks (MIT-States and UT-Zappos50K) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB We propose an end-to-end solution to address the problem of object localisation in partial scenes, where we aim to estimate the position of an object in an unknown area given only a partial 3D scan of the scene. We propose a novel scene representation to facilitate the geometric reasoning, Directed Spatial Commonsense Graph (D-SCG), a spatial scene graph that is enriched with additional concept nodes from a commonsense knowledge base. Specifically, the nodes of D-SCG represent the scene objects and the edges are their relative positions. Each object node is then connected via different commonsense relationships to a set of concept nodes. With the proposed graph-based scene representation, we estimate the unknown position of the target object using a Graph Neural Network that implements a sparse attentional message passing mechanism. The network first predicts the relative positions between the target object and each visible object by learning a rich representation of the objects via aggregating both the object nodes and the concept nodes in D-SCG. These relative positions then are merged to obtain the final position. We evaluate our method using Partial ScanNet, improving the state-of-the-art by 5.9% in terms of the localisation accuracy at a 8x faster training speed.

AB This paper explores the problem of reconstructing high-resolution light field (LF) images from hybrid lenses, including a high-resolution camera surrounded by multiple low-resolution cameras. The performance of existing methods is still limited, as they produce either blurry results on plain textured areas or distortions around depth discontinuous boundaries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning-based approach, which can comprehensively utilize the specific characteristics of the input from two complementary and parallel perspectives. Specifically, one module regresses a spatially consistent intermediate estimation by learning a deep multidimensional and cross-domain feature representation, while the other module warps another intermediate estimation, which maintains the high-frequency textures, by propagating the information of the high-resolution view. We finally leverage the advantages of the two intermediate estimations adaptively via the learned confidence maps, leading to the final high-resolution LF image with satisfactory results on both plain textured areas and depth discontinuous boundaries. Besides, to promote the effectiveness of our method trained with simulated hybrid data on real hybrid data captured by a hybrid LF imaging system, we carefully design the network architecture and the training strategy. Extensive experiments on both real and simulated hybrid data demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end deep learning method for LF reconstruction from a real hybrid input. We believe our framework could potentially decrease the cost of high-resolution LF data acquisition and benefit LF data storage and transmission. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/jingjin25/LFhybridSR-Fusion.

TI MLink: Linking Black-Box Models From Multiple Domains for Collaborative

DE Model linking; multi-model inference
AB The cost efficiency of model inference is critical to real-world machine learning (ML) applications, especially for delay-sensitive tasks and resource-limited devices. A typical dilemma is: in order to provide complex intelligent services (e.g., smart city), we need inference results of multiple ML models, but the cost budget (e.g., GPU memory) is not enough to run all of them. In this work, we study underlying relationships among black-box ML models and propose a novel learning task: model linking, which aims to bridge the knowledge of different black-box models by learning mappings (dubbed model links) between their output spaces. We propose the design of model links which supports linking heterogeneous black-box ML models. Also, in order to address the distribution discrepancy challenge, we present adaptation and aggregation methods of model links. Based on our proposed model links, we developed a scheduling algorithm, named MLink. Through collaborative multi-model inference enabled by model links, MLink can improve the accuracy of obtained inference results under the cost budget. We evaluated MLink on a multi-modal dataset with seven different ML models and two real-world video analytics systems with six ML models and 3,264 hours of video. Experimental results show that our proposed model links can be effectively built among various black-box models. Under the budget of GPU memory, MLink can save 66.7% inference computations while preserving 94% inference accuracy, which outperforms multi-task learning, deep reinforcement learning-based scheduler and frame filtering baselines.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied extensively to solve complex decision-making problems. In many real-world scenarios, tasks often have several conflicting objectives and may require multiple agents to cooperate, which are the multi-objective multi-agent decision-making problems. However, only few works have been conducted on this intersection. Existing approaches are limited to separate fields and can only handle multi-agent decision-making with a single objective, or multi-objective decision-making with a single agent. In this paper, we propose MO-MIX to solve the multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL) problem. Our approach is based on the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. A weight vector representing preference over the objectives is fed into the decentralized agent network as a condition for local action-value function estimation, while a mixing network with parallel architecture is used to estimate the joint action-value function. In addition, an exploration guide approach is applied to improve the uniformity of the final non-dominated solutions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively solve the multi-objective multi-agent cooperative decision-making problem and generate an approximation of the Pareto set. Our approach not only significantly outperforms the baseline method in all four kinds of evaluation metrics, but also requires less computational cost.

AB Despite the substantial progress of active learning for image recognition, there lacks a systematic investigation of instance-level active learning for object detection. In this paper, we propose to unify instance uncertainty calculation with image uncertainty estimation for informative image selection, creating a multiple instance differentiation learning (MIDL) method for instance-level active learning. MIDL consists of a classifier prediction differentiation module and a multiple instance differentiation module. The former leverages two adversarial instance classifiers trained on the labeled and unlabeled sets to estimate instance uncertainty of the unlabeled set. The latter treats unlabeled images as instance bags and re-estimates image-instance uncertainty using the instance classification model in a multiple instance learning fashion. Through weighting the instance uncertainty using instance class probability and instance objectness probability under the total probability formula, MIDL unifies the image uncertainty with instance uncertainty in the Bayesian theory framework. Extensive experiments validate that MIDL sets a solid baseline for instance-level active learning. On commonly used object detection datasets, it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by significant margins, particularly when the labeled sets are small.

AB Existing image fusion methods are typically limited to aligned source images and have to "tolerate" parallaxes when images are unaligned. Simultaneously, the large variances between different modalities pose a significant challenge for multi-modal image registration. This study proposes a novel method called MURF, where for the first time, image registration and fusion are mutually reinforced rather than being treated as separate issues. MURF leverages three modules: shared information extraction module (SIEM), multi-scale coarse registration module (MCRM), and fine registration and fusion module (F2M). The registration is carried out in a coarse-to-fine manner. During coarse registration, SIEM first transforms multi-modal images into mono-modal shared information to eliminate the modal variances. Then, MCRM progressively corrects the global rigid parallaxes. Subsequently, fine registration to repair local non-rigid offsets and image fusion are uniformly implemented in F2M. The fused image provides feedback to improve registration accuracy, and the improved registration result further improves the fusion result. For image fusion, rather than solely preserving the original source information in existing methods, we attempt to incorporate texture enhancement into image fusion. We test on four types of multi-modal data (RGB-IR, RGB-NIR, PET-MRI, and CT-MRI). Extensive registration and fusion results validate the superiority and universality of MURF.

AB In zero-shot learning (ZSL), the task of recognizing unseen categories when no data for training is available, state-of-the-art methods generate visual features from semantic auxiliary information (e.g., attributes). In this work, we propose a valid alternative (simpler, yet better scoring) to fulfill the very same task. We observe that, if first- and second-order statistics of the classes to be recognized were known, sampling from Gaussian distributions would synthesize visual features that are almost identical to the real ones as per classification purposes. We propose a novel mathematical framework to estimate first- and second-order statistics, even for unseen classes: our framework builds upon prior compatibility functions for ZSL and does not require additional training. Endowed with such statistics, we take advantage of a pool of class-specific Gaussian distributions to solve the feature generation stage through sampling. We exploit an ensemble mechanism to aggregate a pool of softmax classifiers, each trained in a one-seen-class-out fashion to better balance the performance over seen and unseen classes. Neural distillation is finally applied to fuse the ensemble into a single architecture which can perform inference through one forward pass only. Our method, termed Distilled Ensemble of Gaussian Generators, scores favorably with respect to state-of-the-art works.

AB There are many recent research efforts to fine-tune a pre-trained generator with a few target images to generate images of a novel domain. Unfortunately, these methods often suffer from overfitting or under-fitting when fine-tuned with a single target image. To address this, here we present a novel single-shot GAN adaptation method through unified CLIP space manipulations. Specifically, our model employs a two-step training strategy: reference image search in the source generator using a CLIP-guided latent optimization, followed by generator fine-tuning with a novel loss function that imposes CLIP space consistency between the source and adapted generators. To further improve the adapted model to produce spatially consistent samples with respect to the source generator, we also propose contrastive regularization for patchwise relationships in the CLIP space. Experimental results show that our model generates diverse outputs with the target texture and outperforms the baseline models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we show that our CLIP space manipulation strategy allows more effective attribute editing.

DE Deep learning; panoramic image; reflection removal
ID SEPARATION
AB In this article, we investigate the problem of panoramic image reflection removal to relieve the content ambiguity between the reflection layer and the transmission scene. Although a partial view of the reflection scene is attainable in the panoramic image and provides additional information for reflection removal, it is not trivial to directly apply this for getting rid of undesired reflections due to its misalignment with the reflection-contaminated image. We propose an end-to-end framework to tackle this problem. By resolving misalignment issues with adaptive modules, the high-fidelity recovery of reflection layer and transmission scenes is accomplished. We further propose a new data generation approach that considers the physics-based formation model of mixture images and the in-camera dynamic range clipping to diminish the domain gap between synthetic and real data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its applicability for mobile devices and industrial applications.

AB This paper proposes Panoptic Narrative Grounding, a spatially fine and general formulation of the natural language visual grounding problem. We establish an experimental framework for the study of this new task, including new ground truth and metrics. We propose PiGLET, a novel multi-modal Transformer architecture to tackle the Panoptic Narrative Grounding task, and to serve as a stepping stone for future work. We exploit the intrinsic semantic richness in an image by including panoptic categories, and we approach visual grounding at a fine-grained level using segmentations. In terms of ground truth, we propose an algorithm to automatically transfer Localized Narratives annotations to specific regions in the panoptic segmentations of the MS COCO dataset. PiGLET achieves a performance of 63.2 absolute Average Recall points. By leveraging the rich language information on the Panoptic Narrative Grounding benchmark on MS COCO, PiGLET obtains an improvement of 0.4 Panoptic Quality points over its base method on the panoptic segmentation task. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our method to other natural language visual grounding problems such as Referring Expression Segmentation. PiGLET is competitive with previous state-of-the-art in RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg.

AB Virtual dressing room applications help online shoppers visualize outfits. Such a system, to be commercially viable, must satisfy a set of performance criteria. The system must produce high quality images that faithfully preserve garment properties, allow users to mix and match garments of various types and support human models varying in skin tone, hair color, body shape, and so on. This paper describes POVNet, a framework that meets all these requirements (except body shapes variations). Our system uses warping methods together with residual data to preserve garment texture at fine scales and high resolution. Our warping procedure adapts to a wide range of garments and allows swapping in and out of individual garments. A learned rendering procedure using an adversarial loss ensures that fine shading, etc. is accurately reflected. A distance transform representation ensures that hems, cuffs, stripes, and so on are correctly placed. We demonstrate improvements in garment rendering over state of the art resulting from these procedures. We demonstrate that the framework is scalable, responds in real-time, and works robustly with a variety of garment categories. Finally, we demonstrate that using this system as a virtual dressing room interface for fashion e-commerce websites has significantly boosted user-engagement rates.

AB Existing safe imitation learning (safe IL) methods mainly focus on learning safe policies that are similar to expert ones, but may fail in applications requiring different safety constraints. In this paper, we propose the Lagrangian Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (LGAIL) algorithm, which can adaptively learn safe policies from a single expert dataset under diverse prescribed safety constraints. To achieve this, we augment GAIL with safety constraints and then relax it as an unconstrained optimization problem by utilizing a Lagrange multiplier. The Lagrange multiplier enables explicit consideration of the safety and is dynamically adjusted to balance the imitation and safety performance during training. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization framework to solve LGAIL: (1) a discriminator is optimized to measure the similarity between the agent-generated data and the expert ones; (2) forward reinforcement learning is employed to improve the similarity while considering safety concerns enabled by a Lagrange multiplier. Furthermore, theoretical analyses on the convergence and safety of LGAIL demonstrate its capability of adaptively learning a safe policy given prescribed safety constraints. At last, extensive experiments in OpenAI Safety Gym conclude the effectiveness of our approach.

TI Prototype Completion for Few-Shot Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Few-Shot learning; image classification; meta-learning
ID CLASSIFICATION; MODELS
AB Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with few examples. Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes marginal improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative features for seen attributes as priors. Second, a part/attribute transfer network is designed to learn to infer the representative features for unseen attributes as supplementary priors. Finally, a prototype completion network is devised to learn to complete prototypes with these priors. Moreover, to avoid the prototype completion error, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that fuses the mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples. At last, we also develop an economic prototype completion version for FSL, which does not need to collect primitive knowledge, for a fair comparison with existing FSL methods without external knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method: i) obtains more accurate prototypes; ii) achieves superior performance on both inductive and transductive FSL settings.

DE Activation function; image classification; piecewise linear unit;
   2D-piecewise linear unit
AB The choice of activation functions is crucial to deep neural networks. ReLU is a popular hand-designed activation function. Swish, the automatically searched activation function, outperforms ReLU on many challenging datasets. However, the search method has two main drawbacks. First, the tree-based search space is highly discrete and restricted, which is difficult to search. Second, the sample-based search method is inefficient in finding specialized activation functions for each dataset or neural architecture. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new activation function called Piecewise Linear Unit (PWLU), incorporating a carefully designed formulation and learning method. PWLU can learn specialized activation functions for different models, layers, or channels. Besides, we propose a non-uniform version of PWLU, which maintains sufficient flexibility but requires fewer intervals and parameters. Additionally, we generalize PWLU to three-dimensional space to define a piecewise linear surface named 2D-PWLU, which can be treated as a non-linear binary operator. Experimental results show that PWLU achieves SOTA performance on various tasks and models, and 2D-PWLU is better than element-wise addition when aggregating features from different branches. The proposed PWLU and its variation are easy to implement and efficient for inference, which can be widely applied in real-world applications.

AB We present PyMAF-X, a regression-based approach to recovering a parametric full-body model from a single image. This task is very challenging since minor parametric deviation may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated mesh and the input image. Moreover, when integrating part-specific estimations into the full-body model, existing solutions tend to either degrade the alignment or produce unnatural wrist poses. To address these issues, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it as PyMAF-X for the recovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidence will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the alignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide mesh-image correspondence guidance while spatial alignment attention is introduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When extending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy is proposed in PyMAF-X to produce natural wrist poses while maintaining the well-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets for body, hand, face, and full-body mesh recovery, where PyMAF and PyMAF-X effectively improve the mesh-image alignment and achieve new The project page with code and video results can be found at https://www.liuyebin.com/pymaf-x.

TI Ranking-Based Color Constancy With Limited Training Samples

AB Computational color constancy is an important component of Image Signal Processors (ISP) for white balancing in many imaging devices. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been introduced for color constancy. They achieve prominent performance improvements comparing with those statistics or shallow learning-based methods. However, the need for a large number of training samples, a high computational cost and a huge model size make CNN-based methods unsuitable for deployment on low-resource ISPs for real-time applications. In order to overcome these limitations and to achieve comparable performance to CNN-based methods, an efficient method is defined for selecting the optimal simple statistics-based method (SM) for each image. To this end, we propose a novel ranking-based color constancy method (RCC) that formulates the selection of the optimal SM method as a label ranking problem. RCC designs a specific ranking loss function, and uses a low rank constraint to control the model complexity and a grouped sparse constraint for feature selection. Finally, we apply the RCC model to predict the order of the candidate SM methods for a test image, and then estimate its illumination using the predicted optimal SM method (or fusing the results estimated by the top $k$k SM methods). Comprehensive experiment results show that the proposed RCC outperforms nearly all the shallow learning-based methods and achieves comparable performance to (sometimes even better performance than) deep CNN-based methods with only 1/2000 of the model size and training time. RCC also shows good robustness to limited training samples and good generalization crossing cameras. Furthermore, to remove the dependence on the ground truth illumination, we extend RCC to obtain a novel ranking-based method without ground truth illumination (RCC_NO) that learns the ranking model using simple partial binary preference annotations provided by untrained annotators rather than experts. RCC_NO also achieves better performance than the SM methods and most shallow learning-based methods with low costs of sample collection and illumination measurement.

AB Quantum computers are next-generation devices that hold promise to perform calculations beyond the reach of classical computers. A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum variational autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relations and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further research directions for QGLMs.

DE Boundary; co-occurrence; saliency; semantic segmentation;

AB Existing studies on semantic segmentation using image-level weak supervision have several limitations, including sparse object coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and co-occurring pixels from non-target objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, an improved version of Explicit Pseudo-pixel Supervision (EPS++), which learns from pixel-level feedback by combining two types of weak supervision. Specifically, the image-level label provides the object identity via the localization map, and the saliency map from an off-the-shelf saliency detection model offers rich object boundaries. We devise a joint training strategy to fully utilize the complementary relationship between disparate information. Notably, we suggest an Inconsistent Region Drop (IRD) strategy, which effectively handles errors in saliency maps using fewer hyper-parameters than EPS. Our method can obtain accurate object boundaries and discard co-occurring pixels, significantly improving the quality of pseudo-masks. Experimental results show that EPS++ effectively resolves the key challenges of semantic segmentation using weak supervision, resulting in new state-of-the-art performances on three benchmark datasets in a weakly supervised semantic segmentation setting. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be extended to solve the semi-supervised semantic segmentation problem using image-level weak supervision. Surprisingly, the proposed model also achieves new state-of-the-art performances on two popular benchmark datasets.

AB removal is a critical part of feature-based point cloud registration. In this article, we revisit the model generation and selection of the classic RANSAC approach for fast and ro-bust point cloud registration. For the model generation, we propose a second-order spatial compatibility (SC2) measure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It takes into account global compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more distinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at an early stage. The proposed measure promises to find a certain number of outlier-free consensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model generation more efficient. For the model selection, we propose a new Feature and Spatial consistency constrained Truncated Chamfer Distance (FS-TCD) metric for evaluating the generated models. It considers the alignment quality, the feature matching properness, and the spatial consistency constraint simultaneously, enabling the correct model to be selected even when the inlier rate of the putative corre-spondence set is extremely low. Extensive experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of our method. In addition, we also experimentally prove that the proposed SC' measure and the FS-TCD metric are general and can be easily plugged into deep learning based frameworks.

DE Blind image inpainting; semantic-discontinuity detection; layout map
   prediction; pixel generative adversarial network
ID COMPRESSION
AB Blind image inpainting involves two critical aspects, i.e., "where to inpaint" and "how to inpaint". Knowing "where to inpaint" can eliminate the interference arising from corrupted pixel values; a good "how to inpaint" strategy yields high-quality inpainted results robust to various corruptions. In existing methods, these two aspects usually lack explicit and separate consideration. This paper fully explores these two aspects and proposes a self-prior guided inpainting network (SIN). The self-priors are obtained by detecting semantic-discontinuous regions and by predicting global semantic structures of the input image. On the one hand, the self-priors are incorporated into the SIN, which enables the SIN to perceive valid context information from uncorrupted regions and to synthesize semantic-aware textures for corrupted regions. On the other hand, the self-priors are reformulated to provide a pixel-wise adversarial feedback and a high-level semantic structure feedback, which can promote the semantic continuity of inpainted images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in metric scores and in visual quality. It has an advantage over many existing methods that assume "where to inpaint" is known in advance. Extensive experiments on a series of related image restoration tasks validate the effectiveness of our method in obtaining high-quality inpainting.

   upsampling; self-supervised learning
AB Point clouds upsampling (PCU), which aims to generate dense and uniform point clouds from the captured sparse input of 3D sensor such as LiDAR, is a practical yet challenging task. It has potential applications in many real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving, robotics, AR/VR, etc. Deep neural network based methods achieve remarkable success in PCU. However, most existing deep PCU methods either take the end-to-end supervised training, where large amounts of pairs of sparse input and dense ground-truth are required to serve as the supervision; or treat up-scaling of different factors as independent tasks, where multiple networks are required for different scaling factors, leading to significantly increased model complexity and training time. In this article, we propose a novel method that achieves self-supervised and magnification-flexible PCU simultaneously. No longer explicitly learning the mapping between sparse and dense point clouds, we formulate PCU as the task of seeking nearest projection points on the implicit surface for seed points. We then define two implicit neural functions to estimate projection direction and distance respectively, which can be trained by the pretext learning tasks. Moreover, the projection rectification strategy is tailored to remove outliers so as to keep the shape of object clear and sharp. Experimental results demonstrate that our self-supervised learning based scheme achieves competitive or even better performance than state-of-the-art supervised methods.

TI Self-Supervised Learning from Untrimmed Videos via Hierarchical

AB Natural untrimmed videos provide rich visual content for self-supervised learning. Yet most previous efforts to learn spatio-temporal representations rely on manually trimmed videos, such as Kinetics dataset (Carreira and Zisserman 2017), resulting in limited diversity in visual patterns and limited performance gains. In this work, we aim to improve video representations by leveraging the rich information in natural untrimmed videos. For this purpose, we propose learning a hierarchy of temporal consistencies in videos, i.e., visual consistency and topical consistency, corresponding respectively to clip pairs that tend to be visually similar when separated by a short time span, and clip pairs that share similar topics when separated by a long time span. Specifically, we present a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo++) learning framework, in which the visually consistent pairs are encouraged to share the same feature representations by contrastive learning, while topically consistent pairs are coupled through a topical classifier that distinguishes whether they are topic-related, i.e., from the same untrimmed video. Additionally, we impose a gradual sampling algorithm for the proposed hierarchical consistency learning, and demonstrate its theoretical superiority. Empirically, we show that HiCo++ can not only generate stronger representations on untrimmed videos, but also improve the representation quality when applied to trimmed videos. This contrasts with standard contrastive learning, which fails to learn powerful representations from untrimmed videos. Source code will be made available here.

DE Weakly-supervised; video; action localization; semantic; temporal
   context; correlation learning
AB Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WSTAL) aims to automatically identify and localize action instances in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels as supervision. In this task, there exist two challenges: (1) how to accurately discover the action categories in an untrimmed video (what to discover); (2) how to elaborately focus on the integral temporal interval of each action instance (where to focus). Empirically, to discover the action categories, discriminative semantic information should be extracted, while robust temporal contextual information is beneficial for complete action localization. However, most existing WSTAL methods ignore to explicitly and jointly model the semantic and temporal contextual correlation information for the above two challenges. In this article, a Semantic and Temporal Contextual Correlation Learning Network (STCL-Net) with the semantic (SCL) and temporal contextual correlation learning (TCL) modules is proposed, which achieves both accurate action discovery and complete action localization by modeling the semantic and temporal contextual correlation information for each snippet in the inter- and intra-video manners respectively. It is noteworthy that the two proposed modules are both designed in a unified dynamic correlation-embedding paradigm. Extensive experiments are performed on different benchmarks. On all the benchmarks, our proposed method exhibits superior or comparable performance in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art models, especially achieving gains as high as 7.2% in terms of the average mAP on THUMOS-14. In addition, comprehensive ablation studies also verify the effectiveness and robustness of each component in our model.

ID THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; FRAMES
AB Events-to-video (E2V) reconstruction and video-to-events (V2E) simulation are two fundamental research topics in event-based vision. Current deep neural networks for E2V reconstruction are usually complex and difficult to interpret. Moreover, existing event simulators are designed to generate realistic events, but research on how to improve the event generation process has been so far limited. In this paper, we propose a light, simple model-based deep network for E2V reconstruction, explore the diversity for adjacent pixels in V2E generation, and finally build a video-to-events-to-video (V2E2V) architecture to validate how alternative event generation strategies improve video reconstruction. For the E2V reconstruction, we model the relationship between events and intensity using sparse representation models. A convolutional ISTA network (CISTA) is then designed using the algorithm unfolding strategy. Long short-term temporal consistency (LSTC) constraints are further introduced to enhance the temporal coherence. In the V2E generation, we introduce the idea of having interleaved pixels with different contrast threshold and lowpass bandwidth and conjecture that this can help extract more useful information from intensity. Finally, V2E2V architecture is used to verify the effectiveness of this strategy. Results highlight that our CISTA-LSTC network outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves better temporal consistency. Sensing diversity in event generation reveals more fine details and this leads to a significantly improved reconstruction quality.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Network pruning and quantization are proven to be effective ways for deep model compression. To obtain a highly compact model, most methods first perform network pruning and then conduct quantization based on the pruned model. However, this strategy may ignore that the pruning and quantization would affect each other and thus performing them separately may lead to sub-optimal performance. To address this, performing pruning and quantization jointly is essential. Nevertheless, how to make a trade-off between pruning and quantization is non-trivial. Moreover, existing compression methods often rely on some pre-defined compression configurations (i.e., pruning rates or bitwidths). Some attempts have been made to search for optimal configurations, which however may take unbearable optimization cost. To address these issues, we devise a simple yet effective method named Single-path Bit Sharing (SBS) for automatic loss-aware model compression. To this end, we consider the network pruning as a special case of quantization and provide a unified view for model pruning and quantization. We then introduce a single-path model to encode all candidate compression configurations, where a high bitwidth value will be decomposed into the sum of a lowest bitwidth value and a series of re-assignment offsets. Relying on the single-path model, we introduce learnable binary gates to encode the choice of configurations and learn the binary gates and model parameters jointly. More importantly, the configuration search problem can be transformed into a subset selection problem, which helps to significantly reduce the optimization difficulty and computation cost. In this way, the compression configurations of each layer and the trade-off between pruning and quantization can be automatically determined. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that SBS significantly reduces computation cost while achieving promising performance. For example, our SBS compressed MobileNetV2 achieves 22.6x Bit-Operation (BOP) reduction with only 0.1% drop in the Top-1 accuracy.

AB Panoramic depth estimation has become a hot topic in 3D reconstruction techniques with its omnidirectional spatial field of view. However, panoramic RGB-D datasets are difficult to obtain due to the lack of panoramic RGB-D cameras, thus limiting the practicality of supervised panoramic depth estimation. Self-supervised learning based on RGB stereo image pairs has the potential to overcome this limitation due to its low dependence on datasets. In this work, we propose the SPDET, an edge-aware self-supervised panoramic depth estimation network that combines the transformer with a spherical geometry feature. Specifically, we first introduce the panoramic geometry feature to construct our panoramic transformer and reconstruct high-quality depth maps. Furthermore, we introduce the pre-filtered depth-image-based rendering method to synthesize the novel view image for self-supervision. Meanwhile, we design an edge-aware loss function to improve the self-supervised depth estimation for panorama images. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPDET with a series of comparison and ablation experiments while achieving the state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular panoramic depth estimation. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zcq15/SPDET.

AB Intelligent robotic manipulation is a challenging study of machine intelligence. Although many dexterous robotic hands have been designed to assist or replace human hands in executing various tasks, how to teach them to perform dexterous operations like human hands is still a challenge. This motivates us to conduct an in-depth analysis of human behavior in manipulating objects and propose an object-hand manipulation representation. This representation provides an intuitive and clear semantic indication of how the dexterous hand should touch and manipulate an object based on the object's own functional areas. At the same time, we propose a functional grasp synthesis framework, which does not require real grasp label supervision, but relies on the guidance of our object-hand manipulation representation. In addition, in order to obtain better functional grasp synthesis results, we propose a network pre-training method that can make full use of easily obtained stable grasp data, and a network training strategy to coordinate the loss functions. We conduct object manipulation experiments on a real robot platform, and evaluate the performance and generalization of our object-hand manipulation representation and grasp synthesis framework.

TI Towards Deviation-Robust Agent Navigation via Perturbation-Aware
   Contrastive Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DE Contrastive learning; navigation robustness; progressive training;
   vision-and-language navigation
AB Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) asks an agent to follow a given language instruction to navigate through a real 3D environment. Despite significant advances, conventional VLN agents are trained typically under disturbance-free environments and may easily fail in real-world navigation scenarios, since they are unaware of how to deal with various possible disturbances, such as sudden obstacles or human interruptions, which widely exist and may usually cause an unexpected route deviation. In this paper, we present a model-agnostic training paradigm, called Progressive Perturbation-aware Contrastive Learning (PROPER) to enhance the generalization ability of existing VLN agents to the real world, by requiring them to learn towards deviation-robust navigation. Specifically, a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme is introduced to implement the route deviation, with which the agent is required to still navigate successfully following the original instruction. Since directly enforcing the agent to learn perturbed trajectories may lead to insufficient and inefficient training, a progressively perturbed trajectory augmentation strategy is designed, where the agent can self-adaptively learn to navigate under perturbation with the improvement of its navigation performance for each specific trajectory. For encouraging the agent to well capture the difference brought by perturbation and adapt to both perturbation-free and perturbation-based environments, a perturbation-aware contrastive learning mechanism is further developed by contrasting perturbation-free trajectory encodings and perturbation-based counterparts. Extensive experiments on the standard Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark show that PROPER can benefit multiple state-of-the-art VLN baselines in perturbation-free scenarios. We further collect the perturbed path data to construct an introspection subset based on the R2R, called Path-Perturbed R2R (PP-R2R). The results on PP-R2R show unsatisfying robustness of popular VLN agents and the capability of PROPER in improving the navigation robustness under deviation.

ID TRACKING
AB Trajectory forecasting for traffic participants (e.g., vehicles) is critical for autonomous platforms to make safe plans. Currently, most trajectory forecasting methods assume that object trajectories have been extracted and directly develop trajectory predictors based on the ground truth trajectories. However, this assumption does not hold in practical situations. Trajectories obtained from object detection and tracking are inevitably noisy, which could cause serious forecasting errors to predictors built on ground truth trajectories. In this paper, we propose to predict trajectories directly based on detection results without relying on explicitly formed trajectories. Different from traditional methods which encode the motion cues of an agent based on its clearly defined trajectory, we extract the motion information only based on the affinity cues among detection results, in which an affinity-aware state update mechanism is designed to manage the state information. In addition, considering that there could be multiple plausible matching candidates, we aggregate the states of them. These designs take the uncertainty of association into account which relax the undesirable effect of noisy trajectory obtained from data association and improve the robustness of the predictor. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and its generalization ability to different detectors or forecasting schemes.

TI Unbiased Scene Graph Generation via Two-Stage Causal Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Scene graph generation; causal inference; counterfactuals;
   representation learning; long-tailed distribution
AB Despite the impressive performance of recent unbiased Scene Graph Generation (SGG) methods, the current debiasing literature mainly focuses on the long-tailed distribution problem, whereas it overlooks another source of bias, i.e., semantic confusion, which makes the SGG model prone to yield false predictions for similar relationships. In this paper, we explore a debiasing procedure for the SGG task leveraging causal inference. Our central insight is that the Sparse Mechanism Shift (SMS) in causality allows independent intervention on multiple biases, thereby potentially preserving head category performance while pursuing the prediction of high-informative tail relationships. However, the noisy datasets lead to unobserved confounders for the SGG task, and thus the constructed causal models are always causal-insufficient to benefit from SMS. To remedy this, we propose Two-stage Causal Modeling (TsCM) for the SGG task, which takes the long-tailed distribution and semantic confusion as confounders to the Structural Causal Model (SCM) and then decouples the causal intervention into two stages. The first stage is causal representation learning, where we use a novel Population Loss (P-Loss) to intervene in the semantic confusion confounder. The second stage introduces the Adaptive Logit Adjustment (AL-Adjustment) to eliminate the long-tailed distribution confounder to complete causal calibration learning. These two stages are model agnostic and thus can be used in any SGG model that seeks unbiased predictions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular SGG backbones and benchmarks show that our TsCM can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean recall rate. Furthermore, TsCM can maintain a higher recall rate than other debiasing methods, which indicates that our method can achieve a better tradeoff between head and tail relationships.

DE UniFormer; convolution neural network; transformer; self-attention;
   visual recognition.
AB It is a challenging task to learn discriminative representation from images and videos, due to large local redundancy and complex global dependency in these visual data. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can efficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small neighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global dependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency via self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens lead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified transFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from the typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block are equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and deep layers, allowing tackling both redundancy and dependency for efficient and effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our blocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from image to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any extra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1 K classification task. With only ImageNet-1 K pre-training, it can simply achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of downstream tasks. It obtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V1/V2 video classification tasks, 53.8 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on COCO object detection task, 50.8 mIoU on ADE20 K semantic segmentation task, and 77.4 AP on COCO pose estimation task. Moreover, we build an efficient UniFormer with a concise hourglass design of token shrinking and recovering, which achieves 2-4xhigher throughput than the recent lightweight models.

DE Catastrophic forgetting; continual learning; data-free knowledge
   distillation; mutual information
AB Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on sequential tasks in continual learning. Various methods rely on storing data of previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, which is prohibited in real-world applications considering privacy and security issues. In this paper, we consider a realistic setting of continual learning, where training data of previous tasks are unavailable and memory resources are limited. We contribute a novel knowledge distillation-based method in an information-theoretic framework by maximizing mutual information between outputs of previously learned and current networks. Due to the intractability of computation of mutual information, we instead maximize its variational lower bound, where the covariance of variational distribution is modeled by a graph convolutional network. The inaccessibility of data of previous tasks is tackled by Taylor expansion, yielding a novel regularizer in network training loss for continual learning. The regularizer relies on compressed gradients of network parameters. It avoids storing previous task data and previously learned networks. Additionally, we employ self-supervised learning technique for learning effective features, which improves the performance of continual learning. We conduct extensive experiments including image classification and semantic segmentation, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on continual learning benchmarks.

AB Fusing hyperspectral images (HSIs) with multispectral images (MSIs) of higher spatial resolution has become an effective way to sharpen HSIs. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved promising fusion performance. However, these methods often suffer from the lack of training data and limited generalization ability. To address the above problems, we present a zero-shot learning (ZSL) method for HSI sharpening. Specifically, we first propose a novel method to quantitatively estimate the spectral and spatial responses of imaging sensors with high accuracy. In the training procedure, we spatially subsample the MSI and HSI based on the estimated spatial response and use the downsampled HSI and MSI to infer the original HSI. In this way, we can not only exploit the inherent information in the HSI and MSI, but the trained CNN can also be well generalized to the test data. In addition, we take the dimension reduction on the HSI, which reduces the model size and storage usage without sacrificing fusion accuracy. Furthermore, we design an imaging model-based loss function for CNN, which further boosts the fusion performance. The experimental results show the significantly high efficiency and accuracy of our approach.

   graph representation learning
AB Existing GNNs usually conduct the layer-wise message propagation via the 'full' aggregation of all neighborhood information which are usually sensitive to the structural noises existed in the graphs, such as incorrect or undesired redundant edge connections. To overcome this issue, we propose to exploit Sparse Representation (SR) theory into GNNs and propose Graph Sparse Neural Networks (GSNNs) which conduct sparse aggregation to select reliable neighbors for message aggregation. GSNNs problem contains discrete/sparse constraint which is difficult to be optimized. Thus, we then develop a tight continuous relaxation model Exclusive Group Lasso GNNs (EGLassoGNNs) for GSNNs. An effective algorithm is derived to optimize the proposed EGLassoGNNs model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the better performance and robustness of the proposed EGLassoGNNs model.

AB Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) faces the challenges of memorizing old class distributions and estimating new class distributions given few training samples. In this study, we propose a learnable distribution calibration (LDC) approach, to systematically solve these two challenges using a unified framework. LDC is built upon a parameterized calibration unit (PCU), which initializes biased distributions for all classes based on classifier vectors (memory-free) and a single covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is shared by all classes, so that the memory costs are fixed. During base training, PCU is endowed with the ability to calibrate biased distributions by recurrently updating sampled features under supervision of real distributions. During incremental learning, PCU recovers distributions for old classes to avoid 'forgetting', as well as estimating distributions and augmenting samples for new classes to alleviate 'over-fitting' caused by the biased distributions of few-shot samples. LDC is theoretically plausible by formatting a variational inference procedure. It improves FSCIL's flexibility as the training procedure requires no class similarity priori. Experiments on CUB200, CIFAR100, and mini-ImageNet datasets show that LDC respectively outperforms the state-of-the-arts by 4.64%, 1.98%, and 3.97%. LDC's effectiveness is also validated on few-shot learning scenarios.

AB In this paper, we propose Rainbow UDA, a framework designed to address the drawbacks of the previous ensemble-distillation frameworks when combining multiple unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) models for semantic segmentation tasks. Such drawbacks are mainly caused by overlooking the magnitudes of the output certainties of different members in an ensemble as well as their individual performance in the target domain, causing the distillation process to suffer from certainty inconsistency and performance variation issues. These issues may hinder the effectiveness of an ensemble that includes members with either biased certainty distributions or have poor performance in the target domain. To mitigate such a deficiency, Rainbow UDA introduces two operations: the unification and the channel-wise fusion operations, to address the above two issues. In order to validate the designs of Rainbow UDA, we leverage the GTA5 ? Cityscapes and SYNTHIA ? Cityscapes benchmarks to examine the effectiveness of the two operations, and compare Rainbow UDA against a wide variety of baseline approaches. We also provide a set of analyses to show that Rainbow UDA is effective, robust, and can evolve with time as the ensemble grows.

AB Recent studies indicate that hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) with a macro architecture of interleaved non-overlapped window-based self-attention & shifted-window operation can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various visual recognition tasks, and challenges the ubiquitous convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using densely slid kernels. In most recently proposed hierarchical ViTs, self-attention is the de-facto standard for spatial information aggregation. In this paper, we question whether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical ViT to attain strong performance, and study the effects of different kinds of cross-window communication methods. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with embarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept architecture termed TransLinear can achieve very strong performance in ImageNet-$\text{1}\,k$1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that TransLinear is able to leverage the ImageNet pre-trained weights and demonstrates competitive transfer learning properties on downstream dense prediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We also experiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation inside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication approaches. Our results reveal that the macro architecture, other than specific aggregation layers or cross-window communication mechanisms, is more responsible for hierarchical ViT's strong performance and is the real challenger to the ubiquitous CNN's dense sliding window paradigm.

AB This paper outlines a methodology for the construction of vector fields that can enable a multi-robot system moving on the plane to generate multiple dynamical behaviors by adjusting a single scalar parameter. This parameter essentially triggers a Hopf bifurcation in an underlying time-varying dynamical system that steers a robotic swarm. This way, the swarm can exhibit a variety of behaviors that arise from the same set of continuous differential equations. Other approaches to bifurcation-based swarm coordination rely on agent interaction which cannot be realized if the swarm members cannot sense or communicate with one another. The contribution of this paper is to offer an alternative method for steering minimally instrumented multi-robot collectives with a control strategy that can realize a multitude of dynamical behaviors without switching their constituent equations. Through this approach, analytical solutions for the bifurcation parameter are provided, even for more complex cases that are described in the literature, along with the process to apply this theory in a multi-agent setup. The theoretical predictions are confirmed via simulation and experimental results with the latter also demonstrating real-world applicability.

   reduction; Multi-sensor
AB Human-machine interaction (HMI) has been an important research area in many scientific fields for many years with the development of sensor technologies. With the general use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent years, the gesture recognition concept for HMI has become a considerable study in UAVs. They can be used in different domains and for different purposes. The main motivation for this paper is to create as simple a human-machine interface design for UAVs as possible. The vector-based features can be arranged in low memory size and the low-complexity decision process on them can be aimed. The gesture recognition problem for HMI in UAVs can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem in a multi-sensor system with vectorial data from various types of sensors. The speed of the action and the magnitude of the action can be different even within the same class of gesture action. In other words, user-independent gesture action recognition is difficult due to large intra-class differences in gesture action patterns. This paper introduces the wavelet-based vectorial feature extraction and the discriminant function-based decision in the supervised-based reduced vectorial dimension. According to experimental studies, the promising method is put forward for gesture recognition in the control of UAVs.

AB Efforts to address unsafe behaviors of construction workers have predominantly focused on identifying causative factors, unraveling formation mechanisms, and devising pre-emptive control strategies. Nonetheless, these studies have inadequately examined the reasons behind workers' engagement in unsafe behavior from a behavioral psychology perspective, specifically the collision reaction between impulsivity and self-control in the decision-making process, as well as the lack of exploration of psychological processes and behavioral response mechanisms of workers under different management strategies on construction sites. This paper describes an explanatory closed-loop structured model to simulate the safety performance of workers' behavior under different intervention strategies, considering the behavioral decision process and interactions between workers and managerial environment. The hybrid simulation model for worker's unsafe behavior consists of three parts: the control panel, the proactive management panel, and the reactive panel. The model provides valuable information for explaining the causation of workers' unsafe behaviors and finding efficient management strategies. Through simulation experiments, results show that proactive management has more advantages in maintaining workers' behavioral safety levels over a long period of time than reactive management. This research provides valuable information for policy analysis and decision-making for project managers.

The model providing the best outcome used the Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) layered with a Residual Network (ResNet). The training data were 1135 utterances from Maine aquaculture town hall-like meetings and similar conversations, which had been hand-coded for the discussion disciplines. In addition, we generated 300 phrases corresponding to three conversation outcomes: Intent-to-Act, Options-Generation, and Relationship-Building. We then used the trained model and information retrieval to classify a large corpus of 591 open-source transcripts, containing over 21,000 utterances. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that two discussion disciplines, "Inclusion" and "Courtesy," had positive, statistically significant, impacts on Intent-to-act: a 10 percentage point increase in the share of the Inclusion or Courtesy yielded a 45% or 34% increase, respectively, in the likelihood of Intent-to-Act. This study shows the applicability of neural networks in modeling conversations and identifying the dialog acts that can provide measurable and predictable impact on conversation outcomes. Conversational intelligence can support a variety of human interactions, such as town halls, policy-deliberations, private-public partnerships, and sustainability teamwork.

AB An extended Jaffrey-Hamel problem with heat and mass transfer attributes of viscoelastic fluid over an isothermal porous conduit, where the flow is produced by injecting the fluid at the inlet of the convergent section, has been described. The homogeneous processes dictated by first-order kinetics take place in the adjacent fluid, whereas the heterogeneous reactions supplied by cubic autocatalytic dynamics are believed to take place on the channel wall. To simulate both inertial drag and bulk permeable drag of the porosity medium, a non-Darcy-drag force concept is used. Slow velocity leads to the disregarding of viscous dissipation. Thermal radiation and a heat source or sink work together to keep the temperature in equilibrium in the flow domain. The simulation-based numerical solutions for dimensionless temperature, velocity, and concentration have been derived by applying appropriate similarity transformations to the highly nonlinear momentum equation, thermal, and species concentration equations. A more secure velocity profile results from a longer strain retardation time and a shorter stress relaxation time, whereas both viscoelastic times have reverse consequences. The thermal distribution is quantitatively improved with an increase in the radiation parameter, suggesting a higher rate of heat transmission. Concentration drops as heterogeneous reaction parameters are amplified . With an increase in the porosity number, surface viscous drag becomes more intense. Divergent cross section shows a greater tendency for heat and mass transfer.

AB In this paper, the issues pertaining with the stochastic finite-time stability of stochastic multi-links coupled systems with time delays (SMCSTD) via delayed feedback control are considered. And the model investigated in this paper is constructed on strongly connected digraphs (SCD) and digraphs without strong connectedness, respectively. Besides, stabilization criteria for SMCSTD based on SCD are obtained by the graph theory and the Lyapunov method. In addition, for SMCSTD based on digraphs without strong connectedness, stabilization criteria are proposed by means of the Lyapunov method, the graph theory and the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems. It is worth noting that the theoretical results in this paper relax the constraint of the differential operator LU\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal {L}}U$$\end{document}, which is meaningful.

AB Hunger Games Search (HGS) is a newly developed swarm-based algorithm inspired by the cooperative behavior of animals and their hunting strategies to find prey. However, HGS has been observed to exhibit slow convergence and may struggle with unbalanced exploration and exploitation phases. To address these issues, this study proposes a modified version of HGS called mHGS, which incorporates five techniques: (1) modified production operator, (2) modified variation control, (3) modified local escaping operator, (4) modified transition factor, and (5) modified foraging behavior. To validate the effectiveness of the mHGS method, 18 different benchmark datasets for dimensionality reduction are utilized, covering a range of sizes (small, medium, and large). Additionally, two Parkinson's disease phonation datasets are employed as real-world applications to demonstrate the superior capabilities of the proposed approach. Experimental and statistical results obtained through the mHGS method indicate its significant performance improvements in terms of Recall, selected attribute count, Precision, F-score, and accuracy when compared to the classical HGS and seven other well-established methods: Gradient-based optimizer (GBO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO), and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO).

AB In this paper, a new technique of feature extraction is proposed, which is considered an essential part of natural language processing. Feature extraction is the process of transformation of the unstructured text to a format which is recognizable by computers. This means a transformation to a vector of numbers. The study evaluates and compares the performance of three methods: M1, which is the baseline method TfIdf; M2, which combines TfIdf with POS tags; and M3, a novel technique called MDgwPosF that incorporates weighted TfIdf values based on word depths and the relative frequency of POS tags. The primary focus of the study is to assess and compare the performance of these methods, with particular emphasis on evaluating how M3 performs in comparison with M1 and M2. Two different datasets and feed-forward, LSTM and GRU neural networks were used in this study. The results showed that the feed-forward model with the proposed method MDgwPosF in moderate topology achieved the best performance across various measures. The dataset created automatically performed better than the manual dataset. The differences between methods and topologies were not statistically significant. Statistically significant differences between the classification models were proven. The MDgwPosF method achieved higher accuracy compared to the baseline TfIdf, indicating that incorporating additional information into the vector can enhance the performance of TfIdf.

AB Automatic classification tasks on structured data have been revolutionized by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but the focus has been on binary and nominal classification tasks. Only recently, ordinal classification (where class labels present a natural ordering) has been tackled through the framework of CNNs. Also, ordinal classification datasets commonly present a high imbalance in the number of samples of each class, making it an even harder problem. Focus should be shifted from classic classification metrics towards per-class metrics (like AUC or Sensitivity) and rank agreement metrics (like Cohen's Kappa or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). We present a new CNN architecture based on the Ordinal Binary Decomposition (OBD) technique using Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC). We aim to show experimentally, using four different CNN architectures and two ordinal classification datasets, that the OBD+ECOC methodology significantly improves the mean results on the relevant ordinal and class-balancing metrics. The proposed method is able to outperform a nominal approach as well as already existing ordinal approaches, achieving a mean performance of RMSE=1.0797\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\,\mathrm{\textit{RMSE}}\,}}= 1.0797$$\end{document} for the Retinopathy dataset and RMSE=1.1237\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\,\mathrm{\textit{RMSE}}\,}}= 1.1237$$\end{document} for the Adience dataset averaged over 4 different architectures.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) national strategies provide countries with a framework for the development and implementation of AI technologies. Sixty countries worldwide published their AI national strategies. The majority of these countries with more than 70% are developed countries. The approach of AI national strategies differentiates between developed and developing countries in several aspects including scientific research, education, talent development, and ethics. This paper examined AI readiness assessment in a developing country (Palestine) to help develop and identify the main pillars of the AI national strategy. AI readiness assessment was applied across education, entrepreneurship, government, and research and development sectors in Palestine (case of a developing country). In addition, it examined the legal framework and whether it is coping with trending technologies. The results revealed that Palestinians have low awareness of AI. Moreover, AI is barely used across several sectors and the legal framework is not coping with trending technologies. The results helped develop and identify the following five main pillars that Palestine's AI national strategy should focus on: AI for Government, AI for Development, AI for Capacity Building in the private, public and technical and governmental sectors, AI and Legal Framework, and international Activities.

AB In contemporary artificial intelligence, the challenge is making intricate connectionist systems-comprising millions of parameters-more comprehensible, defensible, and rationally grounded. Two prevailing methodologies address this complexity. The inaugural approach amalgamates symbolic methodologies with connectionist paradigms, culminating in a hybrid system. This strategy systematizes extensive parameters within a limited framework of formal, symbolic rules. Conversely, the latter strategy remains staunchly connectionist, eschewing hybridity. Instead of internal transparency, it fabricates an external, transparent proxy system. This ancillary system's mandate is elucidating the principal system's decisions, essentially approximating its outcomes. Leveraging natural language processing as our analytical lens, this paper elucidates both methodologies: the hybrid method is underscored by the compositional vector semantics, whereas the purely connectionist method evolves as a derivative of neural semantic parsers. This discourse extols the merits of the purely connectionist approach for its inherent flexibility and for a pivotal delineation: segregating the explanatory apparatus from the operational core, thereby rendering artificial intelligence systems reminiscent of human cognition.

AB The multiobjective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem consists of adjusting the generator power and the voltage state of each node within the feasible range in the process of power transmission and, finally of achieving the objectives of optimizing the cost, loss and stability, etc. In the MOOPF, two key decision makers are usually involved, which are the power generation sector and the transmission sector. Thus, it is more suitable to model an MOOPF as a biparty multiobjective optimal power flow (BPMOOPF) problem. However, so far, there is no work on treating and solving the MOOPF problem from the perspective of biparty multiobjective optimization. In this paper, we propose the definition of the BPMOOPF problem as well as a novel evolutionary biparty multiobjective optimization algorithm for solving the BPMOOPF problem, which we call BPMOOPF-EA. Our experimental results show that, compared two state-of-the-art algorithms (C-MOEA/D and A-NSGA-III), our proposed BPMOOPF-EA has a better performance when solving the BPMOOPF problem.

AB In the 3D skeleton-based action recognition task, learning rich spatial and temporal motion patterns from body joints are two foundational yet under-explored problems. In this paper, we propose two methods for improving these problems: (I) a novel glimpse-focus action recognition strategy that captures multi-range pose features from the whole body and key body parts jointly; (II) a powerful temporal feature extractor JD-TC that enriches trajectory features by inferring different inter-frame correlations for different joints. By coupling these two proposals, we develop a powerful skeleton-based action recognition system that extracts rich pose and trajectory features from a skeleton sequence and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale datasets.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Model-based diagnosis aims at identifying the real cause of a system's malfunction based on a formal system model and observations of the system behavior. To discriminate between multiple fault hypotheses (diagnoses), sequential diagnosis approaches iteratively pose queries to an oracle to acquire additional knowledge about the diagnosed system. Depending on the system type, queries can capture, e.g., system tests, probes, measurements, or expert questions.
   As the determination of optimal queries is NP-hard, state-of-the-art sequential diagnosis methods rely on a myopic one-step-lookahead analysis which has proven to constitute a particularly favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and diagnostic effectivity. Yet, this solves only a part of the problem, as various sources of complexity, such as the reliance on costly reasoning services and large numbers of or not explicitly given query candidates, remain.
   To deal with such issues, existing approaches often make assumptions about the (i) type of diagnosed system, (ii) formalism to describe the system, (iii) inference engine, (iv) type of query to be of interest, (v) query quality criterion to be adopted, or (vi) diagnosis computation algorithm to be employed. Moreover, they (vii) often cannot deal with large or implicit query spaces or with expressive logics, or (viii) require inputs that cannot always be provided.
   As a remedy, we propose a novel one-step lookahead query computation technique for sequential diagnosis that overcomes the said issues of existing methods. Our approach (1) is based on a solid theory, (2) involves a systematic search for optimal queries, (3) can operate on implicit and huge query spaces, (4) allows for a two-stage optimization of queries (wrt. their number and cost), (5) is designed to reduce expensive logical inferences to a minimum, and (6) is generally applicable. The latter means that it can deal with any type of diagnosis problem as per Reiter's theory, is applicable with any monotonic knowledge representation language, can interact with a multitude of diagnosis engines and logical reasoners, and allows for a quality optimization of queries based on any of the common criteria in the literature.
   We extensively study the performance of the novel technique using a benchmark of real-world diagnosis problems. Our findings are that our approach enables the computation of optimal queries with hardly any delay, independently of the size and complexity of the considered benchmark problem. Moreover, it proves to be highly scalable, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the domain of our benchmarks by orders of magnitude in terms of computation time while always returning a qualitatively as good or better query.

AB Unlike the traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which apply omni-directional sensors, the directional sensor networks (DSNs) utilize directional sensor nodes. Each directional sensor in DSN is a self-configured in one direction and one coverage range at a same time. In critical industries, the target coverage problem in which every target should be observed by k different sensors increases the reliability and leads the fault tolerant observation. In this case, the huge amount of energy is consumed in comparison with one coverage problem. Since the business continuity in such industries strongly depends on the network lifetime, the energy management and lifetime maximization of such resource-limited networks are still of the most important challenges. To address the issue, this paper formulates the k-coverage challenge to a discrete optimization problem with the network lifespan expansion viewpoint which is an NP-Hard problem. To solve this combinatorial problem, a discrete grey wolf optimization algorithm (D-GWA) is presented. This D-GWA proposes abundant novel exploration and exploitation procedures which permutes discrete search space efficiently. In this regard, the new fitness function is also defined which steers solutions in the directions to engage sensors uniformly in different rounds. It potentially improves network lifetime because of uniform battery usage. During the course of optimization, it utilizes temperature concept of simulated annealing algorithm to running away from local trap. To verify the proposed algorithm in solving k-coverage problem in DSNs, twelve scenarios are conducted. The simulation results experimentally prove that the totally dominance of the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-arts HTOH, LA-based, GWA, and hybrid PSO-GA approaches respectively are the amount of 31.37%, 20.97%, 14.12%, and 7.93% improvement in term of network lifetime expansion. Furthermore, the behavior of D-GWA shows the high potential of scalability in the larger search space.(C) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Referral reward programs (RRPs) are a cost-effective means for companies to acquire new customers, and they have therefore been adopted by diverse businesses. This research investigates how the reward-product congruity of nonmonetary rewards influences consumers' recommendation intention in online RRPs. Specifically, drawing on the theories of congruity fit and schema congruity, we propose that nonmonetary rewards with moderate congruity trigger consumers' recommendation intention in RRPs more than those with high and low congruity. Moreover, this inverted U-shaped relationship is moderated by factors that influence the individual cognitive state (i.e., need for cognition and utilitarian versus hedonic products). An experiment with a 3 (reward-product congruity: high/moderate/low) x 2 (product type: utilitarian app/hedonic app) mixed factorial design was conducted to test our hypotheses. The results largely support our propositions. First, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between reward-product congruity and recommendation intention and a mediated effect of reward attractiveness. Furthermore, need for cognition moderates the effects of reward-product congruity on recommendation intention, and there is a three-way interaction effect among product type, need for cognition, and reward-product congruity. We also discuss the important theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

DE Dataset comparing; StyleSpace; Optimal transport
AB One major challenge in machine learning applications is coping with mismatches between the datasets used in the development and those obtained in real-world applications. These mismatches may lead to inaccurate pre-dictions and errors, resulting in poor product quality and unreliable systems. To address the mismatches, it is important to understand in what sense the two datasets differ. In this study, we propose StyleDiff to inform developers about the types of mismatches between the two datasets in an unsupervised manner. Given two unlabeled image datasets, StyleDiff automatically extracts latent attributes that are distributed differently be-tween the given datasets and visualizes the differences in a human-understandable manner. For example, for an object detection dataset, latent attributes might include the time of day, weather, and traffic congestion of an image that are not explicitly labeled. StyleDiff helps developers understand the differences between the datasets with respect to such latent attribute distributions. Developers can then, for example, collect additional development data with these attributes and conduct additional tests for these attributes to enhance reliability. We demonstrate that StyleDiff accurately detects differences between datasets and presents them in an under-standable format using, for example, driving scene datasets.

AB For real-world graph data, the node class distribution is inherently imbalanced and long-tailed, which naturally leads to a few-shot learning scenario with limited nodes labeled for newly emerging classes. There are many carefully designed solutions for such a few-shot learning problem via methods such as data augmentation, learning transferable initialization, learning prototypes, and many more. However, most, if not all, of them are based on a strong assumption that all the test nodes exclusively come from novel classes, which is impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we study a broader and more realistic problem named generalized few-shot node classification, where the test samples can be from both novel classes and base classes. Compared with the standard few-shot node classification, this new problem imposes several unique challenges, including asymmetric classification and inconsistent preference. To counter those challenges, we propose a shot-aware neural node classifier (Stager) equipped with an uncertainty-based weight assigner module for adaptive propagation. As the existing meta-learning solutions cannot handle this new problem, we propose a novel training paradigm named imbalanced episodic training to ensure the label distribution is consistent between the meta-training and meta-test scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and training paradigm.

AB By integrating social transportation capacity and matching transportation needs, third-party vehicle logistics platforms could efficiently make full use of logistics resources and reduce logistics costs. For a vehicle logistics platform in the future, the adopted strategy for order allocation determines whether the platform could win the competition in a complex business environment to a large extent. After investigating the order allocation ideas proposed by designers of third-party vehicle logistics platforms, we find these ideas typically lead to low efficiency of transportation and cannot solve the problem that is difficult for platforms to obtain accurate information. Besides, it also can be seen that the current order allocation idea rarely considers the impact of goodwill on the platform. To conduct a more efficient order allocation for third-party vehicle logistics platforms, this paper proposes a new allocation method based on the auction mechanism. The proposed auction method could achieve the long-term operation of platforms by weighing and adjusting the revenue of platforms and fleets with second price. According to experiments and analysis, the allocation method proposed in this paper can be more effectively applied to solve the order allocation problem of vehicle logistics platforms than other compared methods, which helps platforms to achieve better economic benefits and goodwill in long-term operations.

AB Distributed shop scheduling problems (DSSPs) have attracted increasing interest in recent years due to the technical trends of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. The distributed assembly blocking flowshop scheduling problem (DABFSP) is a critical class of DSSPs with widespread applications in modern supply chains and manufacturing systems. In this paper, a Q-learning-based hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm (QLHHEA) is proposed to solve DABFSP with the objective of minimizing the makespan. Firstly, a mathematical model of DABFSP is formulated, and two insertion-based speedup strategies are devised to conserve the computational cost of evaluating solutions and to accelerate the search efficiency. Secondly, a problem-specific constructive heuristic is developed to produce high-quality initial solutions. Thirdly, twelve efficient heuristics are designed to construct low-level heuristics (LLHs). The Q-learning-based evolutionary algorithm is applied as a high-level strategy to manipulate the LLHs, which are then executed in order to search the solution space. Moreover, suitable solution encoding and decoding schemes are provided to produce feasible scheduling schedules. The design of experiments is implemented to investigate the impact of the parameters. Finally, a compre-hensive comparison campaign is carried out based on a total of 1710 well-known instances to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm against several state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that QLHHEA significantly outperforms the existing algorithms by a significant margin, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of QLHHEA in solving DABFSP.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB This paper proposes a time-shift image enhancement method for representing constant images in spacetime, deriving the associated events in a specified time, and using them to enhance the degraded images. We assumed constant images as moving objects on a z-plane with different velocities and adopted the spacetime using the Lorentz factor to represent the movement of objects at the constant moment. The changes between the events and a reference frame are used to create adjacent z-plane events. The events provide statistical and pixel-based relationships in order to reconstruct a single frame for the common perspective of the reference image in time. Then, the gamma correction is applied in the reconstructed image based on the obtained statistics to provide enhancement of images by preserving the brightness and improving the contrast and details. In order to demonstrate the proposed methods' general applicability, several challenging referenced and non-referenced datasets from different problem domains are considered. A comparative study has been performed, and the proposed method has been compared to state-of-the-art and recent image enhancement techniques. Both qualitative and quantitative results are analyzed for color correction, detail enhancement, and additional noise for each dataset. The results show that the Time-Shift Method could be effectively used for image enhancement for different problem domains without producing over- or under-enhancement.

AB The broad learning system-based data processing method has been widely used in the field of industrial intelligent operation and maintenance, and has achieved impressive results. However, data island created by privacy concerns in real industrial scenarios makes centralized deep training extremely difficult. In addition, the fluctuating operating conditions of machines including speed and load significantly affect the distribution of monitoring data representing the operating state of the device. These two problems make it difficult to apply broad learning system to practical application scenarios. Therefore, in view of the above problems, a novel cross domain privacy-preserving broad network (CDPPBN) for cross-domain fault classification of rotating machinery is presented. Specifically, a cross-domain interactive data encryption protocol feature extractor is designed firstly to ensure the privacy and security of both source and target domain data during feature extraction process. Then, a domain adaptation target classifier is constructed to achieve the fault classification task in the target domain without labels. In this classifier, a maximum mean discrepancy regularization term is constructed to match the mean projections of the source and target domains to adapt the source classifier to the target domain, and a semi supervised local graph embedding regularization term is constructed to mine the structural features of the target domain data. CDPPBN not only has high performance in terms of data privacy protection, but also makes full use of both labeled source data and unlabeled target data to generate a domain adaptation target classifier. The effectiveness of the presented method is verified through bearing monitoring signal. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed CDPPBN has better data privacy protection capability and data cross-domain diagnosis ability compared with other methods.

AB Predicting the cross-sectional profile of the whole bending segment for metal tube bending is essential to achieve high-precision bending, yet still remains challenging. The existing prediction methods mainly base on theoretical derivation under certain assumptions and approximations, which do not fully characterize the whole bending segment profile neither do they fully utilize the information in the bending process. In this study, a Bo-LSTM-based progressive prediction method for the cross-sectional profile sequence is proposed, which comprehen-sively utilizes the profile information during the bending process and achieves an accurate prediction of the cross-sectional profile of the whole bending segment in the subsequent bending process. Firstly, the method of describing the cross-sectional profile in polar radial vector and the cross-sections of the bending segment in discrete sequences are proposed, which cover the information of cross-sectional distortion and wall thickness variation (viz. cross-sectional defects) for the whole bending segment. Secondly, an LSTM network is constructed integrating Bayesian-optimization-based hyper-parameters selection approach to progressively predict the tube cross-sectional profile sequence. Finally, the proposed methods are verified on simulated datasets as well as experimental data, and the accuracy is compared with networks of different structures. The results show that Bo-LSTM has better prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, the progressive prediction pattern has better robustness compared to chain prediction pattern.

AB In this paper, we propose a group decision-making procedure to rank alternatives in the context of ordered qualitative scales that not necessarily are uniform (the proximities between consecutive terms of the scales can be perceived as different). The procedure manages two ordered qualitative scales. One of them is used to determine the weights of the experts according to their expertise, taking into account the assessments given by a decision-maker to the experts. And another one, that is used by the experts to assess the alternatives. In order to assign numerical scores to the linguistic terms of the ordered qualitative scales, we have introduced and analyzed some scoring functions. They are based on the concept of ordinal proximity measure that properly represents the ordinal proximities between the linguistic terms of the ordered qualitative scales. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB This paper investigates the finite/fixed-time synchronization problem of delayed inertial memristive neural networks (DIMNNs) using interval matrix-based methods within a unified control framework. By employing set-valued mapping and differential inclusion theory, two distinct methods are applied to handle the switching behavior of memristor parameters: the maximum absolute value method and the interval matrix method. Based on these different approaches, two control strategies are proposed to select appropriate control parameters, enabling the system to achieve finite and fixed time synchronization, respectively. Additionally, the resulting theoretical criteria differ based on the chosen control strategy, with one expressed in algebraic form and the other in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical simulations demonstrate that the interval matrix method outperforms the maximum absolute value method in terms of handling memristor parameter switching, achieving faster finite/fixed-time synchronization. Furthermore, the theoretical results are extended to the field of image encryption, where the response system is utilized for decryption and expanding the keyspace.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the significant cost and time involved in identifying barley lines with superior malting quality, the malting industry is searching for accurate and rapid methods to expedite the selection of superior barley lines that meet breeder's goals. The aim of this study is to compare partial least squares regression (PLSR) with advanced statistical models (Bayesian and machine learning) and reliably assess their performance in predicting malt quality traits from near infra-red (NIR) spectral data using barley grains. Using spectral data as predictors and the malt quality traits as references, PLSR outperformed Bayesian and PCA-ANN models for diastatic power (DP), alpha amylase (AA), malt extract (ME), wort protein (WP), soluble to total protein (S/T) ratio, and free amino nitrogen (FAN). WP had the best prediction performance for all models, with the best-performing model, PLSR, having R2$$ {R}<^>2 $$ (RPD) values of 0.55 (1.5). The influential wavelength regions identified based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and coefficient estimates for PLSR and Bayesian models, respectively, were comparatively similar for all malt quality traits. Based on these findings, PLSR analysis and wavelength selection techniques would enhance the future design and optimization of NIR prediction models in malt quality improvement programs.
   In this work, we applied partial least square regression (PLSR) and advanced statistical models (Bayesian and machine learning) on near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra and the reference malt quality data. PLSR outperformed Bayesian and PCA-ANN models, and wort protein had the best prediction performance compared with the other malt quality traits. To this end, the PLSR analysis and wavelength selection techniques would enhance the future design of NIR prediction models for the prediction of malt quality traits.

AB Tiny Deep Learning Models offer many advantages in various applications. From the perspective of statistical machine learning theory the contributions of this paper is to complement the research advances and results obtained so far in real-time 3D object recognition. We propose a Tiny Deep Learning Model named Complementary Spatial Transformer Network (CSTN) for Real-Time 3D object recognition. It turns out that CSTN's working, and analysis are much simplified in a target space setting. We make algorithmic enhancements to perform CSTN computations faster and keep the learning part of CSTN in minimal size. Finally, we provide the experimental verifications of the results obtained in publicly available point cloud data sets ModelNet40 and ShapeNetCore with our model performing 1.65-2 times better in DPS (Detections/s) rate on GPU hardware for 3D object recognition, when compared to state-of-the-art networks.

AB JPEG images are widely used by individual users, data centers, cloud storages, and network file systems. The huge transmission and storage bandwidth of existing JPEG images is becoming a big challenge due to its low compression efficiency. Some methods such as Google's Brunsli can further compress these JPEG images adequately and restore them back to JPEG format losslessly when needed, but its decoding speed is not fast enough especially for real-time mobile applications. To further reduce its decoding complexity, we proposed three optimizations based on Brunsli, which include using asymmetric numeral systems coding to replace the existing arithmetic coding, designing the joint encoding of multiple symbols and cache-friendly optimizing the data structures. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with Brunsli, the proposed method achieves average 1.86-2.25 times decoding faster on mobile platform with comparable compression efficiency which is really valuable for power sensitive real-time mobile applications.

AB Based on the current coal mine roadway using supporting steel belt steel belt auxiliary anchor support, the location of the supporting steel belt anchor holes is mainly done manually; if the location is not accurate, there will be large safety hazards and other problems. An intelligent real-time detection and location method of anchor holes in coal mine roadway support steel belt based on deep learning model and depth camera is proposed. First, to reduce the influence of water mist and dust on the camera and improve the image quality of the camera, the image is pre-processed using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. Second, the YOLOv5s model is improved by adding SPD-Conv and coordinate attention mechanisms to improve the detection capability of the model. Third, a real-time depth map restoration method that fully preserves object edge features is proposed to avoid errors caused by areas with depth values of 0 in the depth map when locating anchor holes in combination with a depth camera. Finally, the improved YOLOv5s model proposed in this paper combined with the repaired depth map was used to achieve the detection and location of anchor holes in a laboratory simulated tunnel with a location error of less than 5 mm and an average FPS of 28.9. In summary, the real-time target detection and location method based on a deep learning model and a depth camera is feasible in an unstructured environment in coal mines.

AB Information privacy is not yet a mature "product." The amount of monetary reward that firms should pay consumers to obtain their data is unknown. This paper measures consumers' valuation of two types of personal information-personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII, with the willing-to-accept (WTA) payoffs using a multi-study mixed-methods approach. We conducted two realistic auction experiments with 150 and 415 participants, respectively, as well as one interview study with 31 participants and a meta-analysis study to explain international differences in WTA prices between China and other countries. We found that while consumers claimed that PII was more valuable than non-PII in the interview study, they did not demand a higher WTA price when monetizing PII in the two experimental studies. However, consumers became more cautious and provided fewer data items when dealing with PII, compared to non-PII. Consumers may ask for a higher price for non-PII than PII when they need to disclose more information. They also strategically select information being disclosed, if possible, to reduce privacy risk. Context only matters in WTA price for certain types of data, which is medical PII data in our case. Specifically, the WTA price for PII is higher in the medical information context than in the shopping information context. The meta-analysis shows that individualism and uncertainty avoidance are two key cultural dimensions explaining international differences in WTA prices.

AB Photovoltaic technologies provide significant capacity to electric grids, however, resource variability and production uncertainty complicate power balancing and reserve management. A crucial step in predicting solar generation is determining clear-sky irradiance. Clear-sky attenuation can be modeled using broadband atmospheric turbidity factors, but model accuracy is dependent on the measurements used to determine the current and future state of aerosol loading and water vapor content, which requires close proximity measurements, in time and space, to account for turbidity variability. Such measurements, though, are only available in near real-time at a limited, and decreasing, number of sites. This paper proposes a new method for estimating time-varying local turbidity conditions from more readily available pyranometer or PV output data. The method employs a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to distill the turbidity-driven signal from global irradiance (or global irradiance driven) observations, despite an inherent dampening issue. The method is developed to operate in near real-time for solar forecasting applications. Validation examines the ability of the method to (1) reproduce turbidity estimates derived from historical measurements of beam irradiance under clear-sky conditions; and (2) provide input for clear-sky models in the form of persistence forecasts generated from daily mean values.

AB Mechanical and thermal properties of materials are extremely important for various engineering and scientific fields such as energy conversion and energy storage. However, the characterization of these properties via high throughput screening at the quantum level, although highly accurate, is inefficient and very time- and resourceconsuming. In contrast, prediction at the classical level is highly efficient but less accurate. We deploy scalable global attention graph neural network for accurate prediction of mechanical properties which bridge the gap between the accuracy at the quantum level and efficiency at the classical level. Using 10,158 elastic constants as training data, we trained the models on 5 mechanical properties, namely bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and hardness. With the trained model, we predicted 775,947 data in search of materials with ultrahigh hardness. We further verify the recommended ultrahigh hardness materials by high precision first principles calculations, and we finally identify 20 structures with extreme hardness close to diamond, the hardest material in nature. Among those, two super hard materials are completely new and have not been reported in literature so far. We further recommend potential materials from bulk modulus prediction to search low lattice thermal conductivity, and we verify the thermal conductivity of 338 structures with first principles. Our results demonstrate that one can find materials with extreme mechanical properties recommended by graph neural network and low thermal conductivity material from bulk modulus prediction with minimal first principles calculations of the structures (only 0.04%) in the large-scale materials pool.

DT Article
DE Contrastive representation learning; Self-supervised learning;
   Whole-slide pathological images
AB Self-supervised representation learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success in its application to natural images while falling behind in performance when applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSIs). This is because the inherent characteristics of WSIs in terms of gigapixel resolution and multiple objects in training patches are fundamentally different from natural images. Directly transferring the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods designed for natural images to WSIs will inevitably compromise their performance. We present a novel scheme SGCL: Spatial Guided Contrastive Learning, to fully explore the inherent properties of WSIs, leveraging the spatial proximity and multi-object priors for stable self-supervision. Beyond the self-invariance of instance discrimination, we expand and propagate the spatial proximity for the intra-invariance from the same WSI and inter-invariance from different WSIs, as well as propose the spatial-guided multi-cropping for inner invariance within patches. To adaptively explore such spatial information without supervision, we propose a new loss function and conduct a theoretical analysis to validate it. This novel scheme of SGCL is able to achieve additional improvements over the SOTA pre-training methods on diverse downstream tasks across multiple datasets. Extensive ablation studies have been carried out and visualizations of these results have been presented to aid understanding of the proposed SGCL scheme. As open science, all codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/HHHedo/SGCL.

AB Considering temporally evolving processes, the search for optimal input selection in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is extended here beyond (i) the readily available independent variables defining the process and (ii) the dependent variables suggested by feature extraction methods, by considering the time scale that characterizes the process. The analysis is based on the process of homogeneous autoignition, which is fully determined by the initial temperature T(0) and pressure p(0) of the mixture and the equivalence ratio �� that specifies the initial mixture composition. The aim is to seek the optimal input for the prediction of the time at which the mixture ignites. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithms are employed for prediction and feature extraction, respectively. It is demonstrated that the time scale that characterizes the initiation of the process ����(0), provides much better accuracy as input to MLP than any pair of the three independent parameters T(0), p(0) and ��or their two principal components. Indicatively, it is shown that using ����(0) as input results in a coefficient of determination R2 in the range of 0.953 to 0.982, while the maximum value of R2 when using the independent parameters or principal components is 0.660. The physical grounds, on which the success of ����(0) is based, are discussed. The results suggest the need for further research in order to develop selection methodologies of optimal inputs among those that characterize the process.

AB As a member of the third generation of artificial neural network models, spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) have gained a hot research spot in recent years. This work introduces the phenomenon of lateral inhibition in biological nervous systems into SN P systems, and proposes SN P systems with lateral inhibition (LISN P systems). LISN P systems add the property of synaptic length to portray the lateral distance between neurons, and adopt a new form of rules, lateral interaction rules, to describe the reception of spikes by postsynaptic neurons with different lateral distances from the presynaptic neuron. Specifically, an excited neuron produces lateral inhibition on surrounding postsynaptic neurons. Postsynaptic neurons close to the excited neuron, i.e., neurons with small lateral distances, are more susceptible to lateral inhibition and either receive a fewer number of spikes generated by the excited neuron or fail to receive spikes. As the lateral distance increases, the lateral inhibition weakens, and the number of spikes received by postsynaptic neurons increases. Based on the above mechanism, four specific LISN P systems are designed for generating arbitrary odd numbers, arbitrary even numbers, arbitrary natural numbers and arithmetic series, respectively, as examples. By designing working modules, LISN P systems provide equivalence in computational power to the universal register machines in both generating and accepting modes. This verifies the computational completeness of LISN P systems. A universal LISN P system using merely 65 neurons is devised for function computation. According to comparisons among several systems, universal LISN P systems require fewer computational resources.

AB Accurately forecasting power load is essential for utilities to effectively manage their resources, reduce operational costs, and provide improved customer service. However, the current load forecasting lacks the ability to deeply explore data, thus failing to accurately predict both short-term trends and volatility ranges. To address this issue, we construct a novel combined forecasting system based on rough sets, information granulation, deep learning, and multi-objective optimization. In this study, we follow the reasonable granulation criterion for granular computing, which aims to improve the reasonableness and specificity of granular interval prediction under the determination of granularity level, and innovatively propose a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm that can simultaneously constrain the reasonable granulation criterion and theoretically demonstrate the obtained Paretooptimal solution. Four simulation experiments were conducted using the Australian dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed system in predicting trend changes and fluctuation ranges of power load. Our results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts the trend changes and fluctuation range of power load. Specifically, our system showed a deterministic prediction performance improvement of 13.39% and a granularity interval prediction performance improvement of 6.67% compared to the baseline model. Moreover, we conducted a series of discussion tests to validate the superiority of our system, which further confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID MODEL
AB Energy efficiency in the petrochemical industry is crucial in reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. An accurate energy efficiency model will provide valuable insight for supporting operational adjustment decisions. In practice, due to inconsistent sampling intervals in the petrochemical industry, the traditional approach for obtaining energy efficiency may be unreliable and difficult to handle these multirate data characteristics. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-channel convolutional neural network model integrating a model parameter-based transfer learning approach is proposed to improve the prediction of energy efficiency under inconsistent sampling intervals. The multi-channel structure aims to recognize a different pattern from the dataset by convolving the information along the time dimension. Concurrently, transfer learning allows the model to learn a new pattern of input after the model is fully trained. Finally, the performance for energy efficiency prediction and saving analysis is validated by applying it to the vinyl chloride monomer production case study. The result shows that the proposed model outperformed traditional models and typical convolutional neural network structures in terms of accuracy and reproducibility, with an r-square of 0.97. The utilization of transfer learning prevents a significant drop in performance and enhances adaptability in model learning on realtime energy tracking. Moreover, the energy gap analysis of the prediction result identified a significant energy saving potential, which would decrease annual energy consumption by 7.25% on average and a 5,709-ton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

AB Green house gases reduction is critical in current climate emergency and was declared as major target by United Nations. This manuscript proposes the progressive adaptive recursive multi threshold control strategy for hybrid energy storage system that combines thermal storage reservoirs, heat pumps, storage heaters, photovoltaic array and a battery. The newest control strategy is tested in numerical experiment against primal dual simplex optimisation method as benchmark and previous iterations of RED WoLF threshold approaches. The proposed algorithm allows improvement in reduction of CO2 emissions by 9% comparatively to RED WoLF double threshold approach and by 26% comparatively to RED WoLF single threshold approach. Besides, the proposed technique is at least 100 times faster than linear optimisation, making the algorithm applicable to edge systems. The proposed method is later tested in numerical experiment on two measured datasets from Luxembourg school and office, equipped with batteries and ground source heat pumps. The system allows the reduction of CO2 emission and improvement of self-consumption, size reduction of the photovoltaic array installed at the facilities by at least by half as well as substituting battery storage by thermal storage, reducing the initial investment to the system. Intriguingly, despite 3.6 times difference in efficiency between heat pumps and storage heaters, the system equipped with latter have potential to achieve similar performance in carbon reduction, suggesting that energy storage have more prominent carbon reduction effect, than the power consumption, making cheaper systems with storage heaters a possible alternative to heat pumps.

AB Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is a severe complication of diabetes, and it may cause lower limb amputation. However, the manual diagnosis of DFU is a complicated and expensive process. The primary objective of this work is to design an efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to identify DFU. Therefore, a novel CNN-based approach (AESPNet) is proposed in this paper, where convolution layers are stacked together in a parallel fashion and with an intermediate attention module to perform DFU vs -normal skin classification. The AESPNet consists of 2 blocks, where varying-sized kernel convolution layers are connected in a parallel fashion for better local and global feature abstraction. A bottleneck attention module is associated after every concatenation operation in the network. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (with momentum) optimizer with 1e -2 learning rate is used to train the proposed network on a privately accessed DFU dataset. The results of the proposed approach are compared with other standard CNN-based schemes, namely AlexNet, VGG16, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3. It has been found that the proposed AESPNet outperforms state-of-the-art schemes with a sensitivity score of 98.44% and 0.98 F1-Scores.

AB This paper presents a task allocation strategy for a multi-robot system with a human supervisor. The multi-robot system consists of a team of heterogeneous robots with different capabilities that operate in a dynamic scenario that can change in the robots' capabilities or in the operational requirements. The human supervisor can intervene in the operation scenario by approving the final plan before its execution or forcing a robot to execute a specific task. The proposed task allocation strategy leverages an auction-based method in combination with a sampling-based multi-goal motion planning. The latter is used to evaluate the costs of execution of tasks based on realistic features of paths. The proposed architecture enables the allocation of tasks accounting for priorities and precedence constraints, as well as the quick re-allocation of tasks after a dynamic perturbation occurs -a crucial feature when the human supervisor preempts the outcome of the algorithm and makes manual adjustments. An extensive simulation campaign in a rescue scenario validates our approach in dynamic scenarios comprising a sensor failure of a robot, a total failure of a robot, and a human-driven re-allocation. We highlight the benefits of the proposed multi-goal strategy by comparing it with single-goal motion planning strategies at the state of the art. Finally, we provide evidence for the system efficiency by demonstrating the powerful synergistic combination of the auction-based allocation and the multi-goal motion planning approach.

DE Visual SLAM; Smantic mapping; Object representation; Superquadrics
AB Object SLAM uses additional semantic information to detect and map objects in the scene, in order to improve the system's perception and map representation capabilities. Previous methods often use quadrics and cuboids to represent objects, especially in monocular systems. However, their simplistic shapes are insufficient for effectively representing various types of objects, leading to a limitation in the accuracy of object maps and consequently impacting downstream task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for representing objects in monocular SLAM using superquadrics (SQ) with shape parameters. Our method utilizes object appearance and geometry information comprehensively, enabling accurate estimation of object poses and adaptation to various object shapes. Additionally, we propose a lightweight data association strategy to accurately associate semantic observations across multiple views with object landmarks. We implement a monocular semantic SLAM system with real-time performance and conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets. The results show that our method is able to build accurate object maps and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on object representation.

AB In multi-robot navigation tasks, the interaction between a large number of robots in dynamic environments greatly affects the results of navigation. The interaction between the robots changes with environmental conditions. Therefore, capturing the attention to other robots can greatly improve navigation efficiency. Besides, the learning policy conservatively deals with many high-frequency scenarios. However, in some infrequent scenes, such as dead corners, it can't perform well. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance policy trained with deep reinforcement learning, which captures the relationship between robots using Graph Attention Network (GAT). The attention mechanism can indicate the importance of interaction between robots. We present a hierarchical structure to improve the navigation efficiency, which uses motion selector as high-level action and uses collision avoidance policy and target-driven policy as low-level actions. We conduct experiments in Stage simulator and Openai gym, the results indicate that our approach performs better in navigation tasks compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the multi-agent field.

AB The recent development of lower limb exoskeletons has focus on assisting walking on a variety of terrains, such as level ground, stairs, and ramps. However, smooth transitions between different locomotion modes are challenging due to unknown future information. In this paper, we propose a method that adaptively generates a complete gait cycle of trajectory and event prediction for lower limb exoskeletons during the transition stage. First, we design a generative model with the variational autoencoder (VAE) structure to parameterize the gait cycles of trajectory and events into low-dimensional latent representations. Then, the gait trajectory and event prediction are generated by VAE reconstruction, stride time and gait phase alignment. Lastly, reinforcement learning (RL) is adopted to minimize the process error of continuous gait trajectory and event prediction by finding the optimal latent representations of a generative model. The experiments collected gait data from passive and active exoskeletons. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the extend Kalman filter (EKF)-based method and moving horizon estimation (MHE)-based method for both gait trajectory and event prediction tasks during transitions between and within locomotion modes. The capability of our method gives the opportunity to enrich the control mode by providing future information and contributes a valuable tool for natural and smooth transitions among different terrains for the lower limb exoskeleton.

AB Robot pose estimation plays a fundamental role in various applications involving service and industrial robots. Among the methods used for robot pose estimation from a single image, the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) based approach is widely used due to its popularity and efficiency. An important part of this framework is keypoint detection. However, the current keypoint detection module used for PnP has two problems: Small number of input keypoints and Large error of input keypoints. This paper proposes a Grouping and Soft-ArgMax (G-SAM) framework to address these two problems: First, a simple and powerful Soft-ArgMax module followed by point subset selection is designed to address the problem of small number of input keypoints; Second, a grouping module is introduced, taking into account the texture and spatial structure information of the robot, to solve the problem of large error of input keypoints. Extensive experiments compare our proposed framework with existing state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets and demonstrate that it can provide more reliable, accurate and faster pose estimation for robotic applications.

AB Instance segmentation has drawn mounting attention due to its significant utility. However, high computational costs have been widely acknowledged in this domain, as the instance mask is generally achieved by pixel-level labeling. In this paper, we present a conceptually efficient contour regression network based on the you only look once (YOLO) architecture named YOLO-CORE for instance segmentation. The mask of the instance is efficiently acquired by explicit and direct contour regression using our designed multi-order constraint consisting of a polar distance loss and a sector loss. Our proposed YOLO-CORE yields impressive segmentation performance in terms of both accuracy and speed. It achieves 57.9% AP@0.5 with 47 FPS (frames per second) on the semantic boundaries dataset (SBD) and 51.1% AP@0.5 with 46 FPS on the COCO dataset. The superior performance achieved by our method with explicit contour regression suggests a new technique line in the YOLO-based image understanding field. Moreover, our instance segmentation design can be flexibly integrated into existing deep detectors with negligible computation cost (65.86 BFLOPs (billion float operations per second) to 66.15 BFLOPs with the YOLOv3 detector).

AB Insulators are important components of power transmission lines. Once a failure occurs, it may cause a large-scale blackout and other hidden dangers. Due to the large image size and complex background, detecting small defect objects is a challenge. We make improvements based on the two-stage network Faster R-convolutional neural networks (CNN). First, we use a hierarchical Swin Transformer with shifted windows as the feature extraction network, instead of ResNet, to extract more discriminative features, and then design the deformable receptive field block to encode global and local context information, which is utilized to capture key clues for detecting objects in complex backgrounds. Finally, the filling data augmentation method is proposed for the problem of insufficient defects and more images of insulator defects under different backgrounds are added to the training set to improve the robustness of the model. As a result, the recall increases from 89.5% to 92.1%, and the average precision increases from 81.0% to 87.1%. To further prove the superiority of the proposed algorithm, we also tested the model on the public data set Pascal visual object classes (VOC), which also yields outstanding results.

AB In remote sensing image classification, active learning aims to obtain an excellent classification model by selecting informative or representative training samples. However, due to the complexity of remote sensing images, the same class of ground objects usually have different spectral representations. The existing active learning methods may not take into account diverse representations of the same targets, which leads to a possible lack of intra-class diversity in the collected samples. To alleviate this problem, we propose an active learning method based on similarity level histogram (SLH) and adaptive scale sampling to improve very high resolution remote sensing image classification. Specifically, we construct a SLH for each class of ground objects to effectively consider the intra-class diversity of the same target. To avoid the problem of sample imbalance caused by over-sampling or under-sampling, we design an adaptive-scale sampling strategy. Then, we utilize active learning to mine representative samples from each SLH warehouse according to adaptive-scale sampling strategies until the iteration condition is satisfied. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better classification performance with limited training samples and is competitive with other methods based on four sets of publicly available data. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID PARAMETERS
AB Differential Evolution (DE) is a powerful population-based evolutionary algorithm for global optimiza-tion, and it is widely used in many scientific and engineering applications. There are two commonly used crossover schemes in the literature: one is binomial crossover and the other is exponential crossover. The majority of DE researchers believe that DE variants employing binomial crossover usually obtain superior performance than the ones employing exponential crossover on numerical optimization and DE variants with exponential crossover are good at tackling optimization problems with linkages among neighboring variables. On the contrary, here in this paper, a new perspective is proposed that DE variant with exponential crossover can obtain competitive performance with the ones employing binomial crossover on numerical optimization regardless of whether there are linkages among the variables or not after discovering the proper crossover rate Cr and its corresponding parameter control, and the main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: (1) The first powerful DE variant with exponential crossover, namely the DE-EXP algorithm, which is superior to the recent winner DE variants, e.g. LSHADE, iLSHADE and jSO, in Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) competitions, is developed for numerical optimization; (2) A novel parameter control of crossover rate Cr is developed for exponential crossover and the value of Cr can be automatically generated not only in the initialization stage but also during the evolution. (3) A black-box model illustrating the fitness-value-dependency weakness of the recent winner DE variants in CEC competitions is given and a novel fitness-value-independent adaptation scheme for scale factor F is proposed in the DE-EXP algorithm to overcome the fitness-value-dependency weakness. A larger test suite containing 88 benchmarks is used for the validation of our DE-EXP algorithm, and experiment results show its superiority in comparison with several state-of-the-art DE variants.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Energy storage is an effective way to address the instability of renewable energy generation modes, such as wind and solar, which are projected to play an important role in the sustainable and low-carbon society. Economics and carbon emissions are important indicators that should be thoroughly considered for evaluating the feasibility of energy storage technologies (ESTs). In this study, we study two promising routes for large-scale renewable energy storage, electrochemical energy storage (EES) and hydrogen energy storage (HES), via technical analysis of the ESTs. The levelized cost of storage (LCOS), carbon emissions and uncertainty assessments for EESs and HESs over the life cycle are conducted with full consideration of the critical links for these routes. In order to reduce the evaluation error, we use the Monte Carlo method to derive a large number of data for estimating the economy and carbon emission level of ESTs based on the collected data. The results show that lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries show the lowest LCOS and carbon emissions, at 0.314 US$ kWh-1 and 72.76 gCO2e kWh-1, compared with other batteries for EES. Different HES routes, meaning different combinations of hydrogen production, delivery and refueling methods, show substantial differences in economics, and the lowest LCOS and carbon emissions, at 0.227 US$ kWh-1 and 61.63 gCO2e kWh-1, are achieved using HES routes that involve hydrogen production by alkaline electrolyzer (AE), delivery by hydrogen pipeline and corresponding refueling. The findings of this study suggest that HES and EES have comparable levels of economics and carbon emissions that should be both considered for large-scale renewable energy storage to achieve future decarbonization goals.

AB The rapid phase-in of electric vehicles (EV) will cause unprecedented issues with managing the supply of electricity and charging stations. It is in the interest of utility providers and everyday consumers to be able to plan for peak charging times, and related congestion. While past work has been done for localized, shortterm forecasting, it has not included longer term forecasting, or considered the relationships between multiple stations. Importantly, past work has also not offered a framework for dataset construction and evaluated different dataset features. We propose a methodology to forecast demand at public EV charging stations, and use it to explore the potential of data-driven models to predict demand up to one week in advance. Our strategy includes selecting parameters for formatting a dataset given a list of charging events, a way to consider flexible prediction horizons, and deployment of deep and supervised learning-based models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to propose machine learning to forecast medium-term public EV charging demand, to exploit weather and other features at public charging stations, and to forecast demand at multiple stations and the entire network. We validated our approach using data from eleven stations over three years from Scotland, UK. Our method outperforms the benchmark time series method, and predicts network demand with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 5.9% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 124.7 kWh, or less than twelve percent of average daily demand.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has had drastic effects on societies around the world. Due to restrictions or recommendations, companies, industries and residents experienced changes in their routines and many people shifted to working from home. This led to alterations in electricity consumption between sectors and changes in daily patterns. Understanding how various properties and features of load patterns in the electricity network were affected is important for forecasting the network's ability to respond to sudden changes and shocks, and helping system operators improve network management and operation. In this study, we quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shifts in the electricity consumption patterns of different sectors in Sweden. The results show that working from home during the pandemic has led to an increase in the residential sector's total consumption and changes in its consumption patterns, whereas there were only slight decreases in the industrial sector and relatively few changes in the public and commercial sectors. We discuss the reasons for these changes, the effects that these changes will have on expected future electricity consumption patterns, as well as the effects on potential demand flexibility in a future where working from home has become the new norm.

AB The development of artificial intelligence (AI) greatly boosts scientific and engineering innovation. As one of the promising candidates for transiting the carbon intensive economy to zero emission future, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells has aroused extensive attentions. The gas diffusion layer (GDL) strongly affects the water and heat management during PEM fuel cells operation, therefore multi-variable optimization, including thickness, porosity, conductivity, channel/rib widths and compression ratio, is essential for the improved cell performance. However, traditional experiment-based optimization is time consuming and economically unaffordable. To break down the obstacles to rapidly optimize GDLs, physics-based simulation and machine learning-based surrogate modelling are integrated to build a sophisticated M5 model, in which multi-physics and multi-phase flow simulation, machine-learning-based surrogate modelling, multi-variable and multi objects optimization are included. Two machine learning methodologies, namely response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) are compared. The M5 model is proved to be effective and efficient for GDL optimization. After optimization, the current density and standard deviation of oxygen distribution at 0.4 V are improved by 20.8% and 74.6%, respectively. Pareto front is obtained to trade off the cell performance and homogeneity of oxygen distribution, e.g., 20.5% higher current density is achieved when sacrificing the standard deviation of oxygen distribution by 26.0%.

AB Residential short-term electric load forecasting is essential in modern decentralized power systems. Load forecasting methods mostly rely on neural networks and require access to private and sensitive electric load data for model training. Conventional neural network training aggregates all data on a centralized server to train one global model. However, the aggregation of user data introduces security and data privacy risks. In contrast, this study investigates the modern neural network training methods of federated learning and model personalization as potential solutions to security and data privacy problems. Within an extensive simulation approach, the investigated methods are compared to the conventional centralized method and a pre-trained baseline predictor to compare their respective performances. This study identifies that the underlying data structure of electric load data has a significant influence on the loss of a model. We therefore conclude that a comparison of loss distributions will in fact be considered a comparison of data structures, rather than a comparison of the model performance. As an alternative method of comparison of loss values, this study develops the "differential comparison". The method allows for the isolated comparison of model loss differences by only comparing the losses of two models generated by the same data sample to build a distribution of differences. The differential comparison method was then used to identify model personalization as the best performing model training method for load forecasting among all analyzed methods, with a superior performance in 59.1 % of all cases.

SO NEURAL NETWORKS

DT Article
DE Distorted image classification; Neural activation pattern matching loss;
   Deep neural network
AB In image classification, a deep neural network (DNN) that is trained on undistorted images constitutes an effective decision boundary. Unfortunately, this boundary does not support distorted images, such as noisy or blurry ones, leading to accuracy drop-off. As a simple approach for classifying distorted images as well as undistorted ones, previous methods have optimized the trained DNN again on both kinds of images. However, in these methods, the decision boundary may become overly complicated during optimization because there is no regularization of the decision boundary. Consequently, this decision boundary limits efficient optimization. In this paper, we study a simple yet effective decision boundary for distorted image classification through the use of a novel loss, called a "neural activation pattern matching (NAPM) loss". The NAPM loss is based on recent findings that the decision boundary is a piecewise linear function, where each linear segment is constructed from a neural activation pattern in the DNN when an image is fed to it. The NAPM loss extracts the neural activation patterns when the distorted image and its undistorted version are fed to the DNN and then matches them with each other via the sigmoid cross-entropy. Therefore, it constrains the DNN to classify the distorted image and its undistorted version by the same linear segment. As a result, our loss accelerates efficient optimization by preventing the decision boundary from becoming overly complicated. Our experiments demonstrate that our loss increases the accuracy of the previous methods in all conditions evaluated.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Effective exploration is the key to achieving high returns for reinforcement learning. Agents must explore jointly in multi-agent systems to find the optimal joint policy. Due to the exploration problem and the shared reward, the policy-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms face policy overfitting, which may lead to the joint policy falling into a local optimum. This paper introduces a novel general framework called Learning Joint-Action Intrinsic Reward (LJIR) for improving multi-agent reinforcement learners' joint exploration ability and performance. LJIR observes agents' state and joint actions to learn to construct an intrinsic reward online that can guide effective joint exploration. With the novel combination of Transformer and random network distillation, LJIR selects the novel states to give more intrinsic rewards, which help agents find the best joint actions. LJIR can dynamically adjust the weight of exploration and exploitation during training and keep the policy invariance finally. To ensure LJIR seamlessly adopts existing MARL algorithms, we also provide a flexible combination method for intrinsic and external rewards. Empirical results on the SMAC benchmark show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in challenging tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Fingerprint recognition
AB Fingerprint recognition has emerged as one of the most reliable biometric authentication methods, owing to its uniqueness and permanence. However, the security and confidentiality of the user's data are key considerations in modern biometric systems. In this study, we describe an intelligent computational technique for automatically validating fingerprints for identification and verification purposes. The feature vector is created by fusing Gabor filtering features with deep learning techniques like the faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN). This study uses linear and decision-based median filtering (DBMF) techniques to minimize visual impulse noise. Faster-R-CNN with DBMF was applied to the feature vectors to reduce overfitting problems while improving classification precision and reliability. For fingerprint matching, the Euclidean distance between the associated Harris-SURF feature vectors of two feature points is used to measure feature-matching similarity between two fingerprint images. Furthermore, for fine-tuned matching an iterative technique known as RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is used. The experimental results collected from the public-domain fingerprint databases FVC-2002 DB1 and FVC-2000 DB1 show that the proposed design is viable and performs well with an accuracy of 99.43%, MSE value of 43.321%, and an execution time of 3.102 ms which was more exact than existing models.

ID WIND TURBINE BEARING; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings due to its effectiveness in revealing correlations in condition monitoring data. However, traditional GCNs use a single graph only, either a temporal-correlated graph or a feature-correlated graph without considering both temporal and feature correlations of condition monitoring data. Additionally, traditional GCNs rely heavily on pre-defined graphs to aggregate correlated features. However, the topology of these predefined graphs may vary depending on a pre-defined threshold for cosine similarity or covariance which might affect prediction accuracy and robustness. To address these issues, we introduce a spectral graph convolutional operation that can handle both temporal-correlated and feature-correlated graphs, which allows one to consider both the temporal and feature correlations simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce a self-attention mechanism to construct the temporal-correlated and feature-correlated graphs automatically without defining a threshold. Such a mechanism allows the predictive model to learn graphs automatically during training so that the prediction accuracy and robustness can be significantly improved. The proposed method is demonstrated on two bearing datasets, and the experimental results have shown that it outperforms both traditional GCNs and other deep-learning methods in predicting RUL of bearings.

AB Many social interactions rely on the premise of mutual trust, but deception violates trust and poses risk. Empirically examining trust and deception, particularly in high-stakes situations, is challenging but essential for improving the research realism and generalizability. To address this difficulty, we study trusting and deceptive behaviors in a high-stakes situation by using a novel dataset created from an American game show, Friend or Foe (FoF). In the show, a contestant's reward was determined through a trust game modified from the prisoner's dilemma. We explore how numerous human behaviors including facial expressions, gaze, head pose, body motion, language, and socio-demographic attributes, were related to a contestant's trusting or deceptive decision. Using a data-driven approach, we find that the deceivers' (contestants who chose Foe) behavior featured a neutralized face, negative facial emotions, enhanced upper body motion, and language with a lower sense of immediacy and agreeableness. The contestants who chose to trust (chose Friend) exhibited opposite behavioral patterns. Socio-demographic factors such as age, height, and facial attractiveness were also associated with a contestant's choice. Combining multimodal information, machine learning classifiers could predict the contestant's choice with an accuracy about 25% greater than earlier reported human accuracy. We contribute to both trust and deception literature by examining the generalizability of trusting and deceptive behaviors to a new high-stakes scenario. We also add to the decision support literature by showing the superior predictive performances of combining behavioral and socio-demographic features. Furthermore, we contribute to the academic community by introducing the FoF dataset.

DE negative intra-modal; function that; modal or intra-modal. But; pairs

AB Visible-infrared person re-identification (VIPR) is a task of retrieving a specific pedestrian monitored by cameras in different spectra. A dilemma of VIPR is how to reasonably use intra-modal pairs. Fully discarding intra-modal pairs causes a low utilization of training data, while using intra-modal pairs brings a danger of distracting a VIPR model's concentration on handling cross-modal pairs, harming the cross-modal similarity metric learning. For that, a high utilization mismatch amending (HUMA) triplet loss function is proposed for VIPR. The key of HUMA is the multi-modal matching regularization (MMMR), which restricts variations of distance matrices calculated from cross- and intra-modal pairs to cohere cross-and intra-modal similarity metrics, allowing for a high utilization of training data and amending the adverse distractions of intra-modal pairs. In addition, to avoid the risk of harming feature discrimination caused by MMMR preferring coherence in similarity metrics, a novel separated loss function assignment (SLFA) strategy is designed to arrange MMMR well. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art approaches.

AB This paper presents a robust altitude control that merges the principles of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the in-ground-effect model (IGE). To this end, a nonlinear extended state observer is designed along the vertical axis, taking attitude and altitude measurements. Then, the forces generated by low-level flight, ground effect and other external disturbances are estimated and used (as an anticipation term) together with a non-linear control law (as a feedback term) to reject them. Closed-loop stability is analyzed in the Lyapunov sense. Extensive numerical simulations and real-time experiments validate the proposal. Thanks to its simplicity, the control algorithm is easy to implement. It can be used for various maneuvers that depend on proximity to the ground, obstacles or surfaces, such as take-off, landing, inspection, surveillance and hovering.

AB This paper highlights the significance of maintaining and enhancing situational awareness in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) missions. It focuses specifically on investigating the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with limited sensing capabilities and onboard computational resources to perform visual inspections of apriori unknown fractured and collapsed structures in unfamiliar environments. The proposed approach, referred to as First Look Inspect-Explore (FLIE), employs a flexible bifurcated behavior tree that leverages real-time RGB image and depth cloud data. By employing a recursive and reactive synthesis of safe view pose within the inspection module, FLIE incorporates a novel active visual guidance scheme for identifying previously inspected surfaces. Furthermore, the integration of a tiered hierarchical exploration module with the visual guidance system enables the UAV to navigate towards new and unexplored structures without relying on a map. This decoupling reduces memory overhead and computational effort by eliminating the need to plan based on an incrementally built, error-prone global map. The proposed autonomy is extensively evaluated through simulation and experimental verification under various scenarios and compared against state-of-art approaches, demonstrating its performance and effectiveness.

AB We study discussions in Wikidata, the world's largest open-source collaborative knowledge graph (KG). This is important because it helps KG community managers understand how discussions are used and inform the design of collaborative practices and support tools. We follow a mixed-methods approach with descriptive statistics, thematic analysis, and statistical tests to investigate how much discussions in Wikidata are used, what they are used for, and how they support knowledge engineering (KE) activities. The study covers three core sources of discussion, the talk pages that accompany Wikidata items and properties, and a general-purpose communication page. Our findings show low use of discussion capabilities and a power-law distribution similar to other KE projects such as Schema.org. When discussions are used, they are mostly about KE activities, including activities that span across the entire KE lifecycle from conceptualisation and implementation to maintenance and taxonomy building. We hope that the findings will help Wikidata devise improved practices and capabilities to encourage the use of discussions as a tool to collaborate, improve editor engagement, and engineer better KGs.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Enabling higher levels of autonomy while ensuring safety requires an increased ability to identify and handle internal faults and unforeseen changes in the environment. This article presents an approach to improve this ability for a robotic system executing a series of independent tasks by using a dynamic decision network (DDN). A simulation case study of an industrial inspection drone performing contact-based inspection is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the resulting system. The case study demonstrates that the system is able to infer the presence of internal faults and the state of the environment by fusing information over time. This information is used to make risk-informed decisions enabling the system to proactively avoid failure and to minimize the consequence of faults. Lastly, the case study demonstrates that evaluating past states with new information enables the system to identify and counteract previous sub-optimal actions.

AB How to carry out an effective and automatic analysis for a technological field based on extensive patent data has always been an interesting and meaningful question. In this paper, we propose a framework to reveal the technology fusion and evolution process of a domain by combining patent claims and citations. First, we consider patent claims as technical elements, based on which the development process of a domain can be studied in a more detailed way. Second, the important technical elements appearing in different periods can be obtained through calculating the importance values. They can reveal the changing process of valuable techniques in various periods from a micro perspective. Third, we propose a method for constructing the technological development main paths of a domain from the perspective of technical details. Fourth, based on the proposed main paths, an approach is raised to explore the fusion and evolution process of a domain through a technological origin and development analysis. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to surgical robot domain for discovering some interesting and meaningful insights.

AB 3D printing technology is considered one of the emerging areas to deal with global sustainability challenges and to facilitate the Industry 4.0 adoption. However, 3D printing technology is still immature due to several limitations and negative perceptions about its quality and performance. The goal of this paper is to propose a cyber physical production system (CPPS) framework for a 3D printer to (i) monitor the process, parameters, and carbon footprint, (ii) predict the nozzle's remaining useful life (RUL), and (iii) prescribe optimum 3D printing parameters for minimizing carbon footprint and printing time, simultaneously at the targeted surface quality. Experiments were designed based on Taguchi L-27 orthogonal array to investigate the relationship between printing parameters and performance characteristics. The usefulness of the proposed framework has been demonstrated for a 3D printer to predict the remaining useful life of the printer nozzle (prognostic model), and to find an optimal combination of printing parameters for the simultaneous optimization of sustainability and productivity at the targeted surface quality (prescriptive model). Layer height was found to have a statically significant impact on the specific carbon footprint followed by scale and bed temperature. Layer height is the only statically significant contributor to the surface roughness of 3D printed parts. The scale and layer height followed by infill have significant effect on the printing time. The significance of the present work lies in enhancing the performance of a conventional 3D printer using low-cost smart sensors, devices, and open-source software. The usefulness of the proposed CPPS framework is demonstrated as a decision support tool for a 3D printer real-time monitoring, visualization, and control. The proposed CPPS framework and its application for prognostic and prescriptive analytics is generic in nature, and is transferable and applicable to other FDM 3D printers, irrespective of brand and size.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The data generated by modern industrial processes often exhibit high-dimensional, nonlinear, timing, and multiscale characteristics. Presently, most of the fault diagnosis methods based on deep learning only consider the part of the characteristics of industrial data, which will cause the loss of part of the feature information during training, thereby affecting the final diagnosis effect. In order to solve the above problems, this article proposes an end-to-end multiscale feature learning method based on model fusion, which can simultaneously extract multiscale spatial features and temporal features of data, effectively reducing the loss of feature information. First, this article combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning and designs a multiscale residual network (MRCNN) to extract high-dimensional nonlinear spatial features of different scales in the data. Then, the extracted features are input into the long and short-term memory (LSTM) network to further extract the temporal features of the data. After the fully connected layer, it is input into the classifier for final fault classification. The residual learning in MRCNN can effectively avoid the problem of model degradation and improve the training efficiency of the model. Through the fusion of MRCNN and LSTM, we can significantly improve the feature extraction ability of the model, thereby greatly improving the diagnosis effect. In the final case experiment, the method improved the comprehensive diagnostic accuracy of the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and industrial coking furnace datasets to 94.43% and 97.80%, respectively, which was significantly better than the existing deep learning model and proves the effectiveness and superiority of this method.

AB In this article, we investigate the prescribed performance tracking control problem for high-order nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) under directed communication topology and unknown control directions. Different from most existing prescribed performance consensus control methods where certain initial conditions are needed to be satisfied, here the restriction related to the initial conditions is removed and global tracking result irrespective of initial condition is established. Furthermore, output consensus tracking is achieved asymptotically with arbitrarily prescribed transient performance in spite of the directed topology and unknown control directions. Our development benefits from the performance function and prescribed-time observer. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation confirm the validity of the developed control scheme.

AB This study proposes a minimum cost consensus-based failure mode and effect analysis (MCC-FMEA) framework considering experts' limited compromise and tolerance behaviors, where the first behavior indicates that a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) expert might not tolerate modifying his/her risk assessment without limitations, and the second behavior indicates that an FMEA expert will accept risk assessment suggestions without being paid for any cost if the suggested risk assessments fall within his/her tolerance threshold. First, an MCC-FMEA with limited compromise behaviors is presented. Second, experts' tolerance behaviors are added to the MCC-FMEA with limited compromise behaviors. Theoretical results indicate that in some cases, this MCC-FMEA with limited compromise and tolerance behaviors has no solution. Thus, a minimum compromise adjustment consensus model and a maximum consensus model with limited compromise behaviors are developed and analyzed, and an interactive MCC-FMEA framework, resulting in an FMEA problem consensual collective solution, is designed. A case study, regarding the assessment of COVID-19-related risk in radiation oncology, and a detailed sensitivity and comparative analysis with the existing FMEA approaches are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to FMEA consensus-reaching.

AB Multiparty learning is an indispensable technique to improve the learning performance via integrating data from multiple parties. Unfortunately, directly integrating multiparty data could not meet the privacy-preserving requirements, which then induces the development of privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), a key research task in multiparty learning. Despite this, the existing PPML methods generally cannot simultaneously meet multiple requirements, such as security, accuracy, efficiency, and application scope. To deal with the aforementioned problems, in this article, we present a new PPML method based on the secure multiparty interactive protocol, namely, the multiparty secure broad learning system (MSBLS) and derive its security analysis. To be specific, the proposed method employs the interactive protocol and random mapping to generate the mapped features of data, and then uses efficient broad learning to train the neural network classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for privacy computing method that jointly combines secure multiparty computing and neural network. Theoretically, this method can ensure that the accuracy of the model will not be reduced due to encryption, and the calculation speed is very fast. Three classical datasets are adopted to verify our conclusion.

DE Classification; differential evolution (DE); feature selection; multiple

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION
AB By selecting a small subset of relevant features, feature selection can reduce the dimensionality of the problem while maintaining or increasing the discriminating ability of the data. However, many existing feature selection approaches ignore the fact that there are multiple optimal solutions to a feature selection problem. Multiple feature subsets with different features selected can achieve very similar or the same classification accuracy. To search for multiple optimal feature subsets, a niching-based differential evolution (DE) method with duplication analysis is proposed. In the proposed method, the duplicated feature subsets in the population are modified by the proposed subset repairing scheme which can produce unique feature subsets. Second, the mutation operator in DE is improved, which uses both the niche and global information to produce promising feature subsets. Third, a new selection method considering the diversity among feature subsets is adopted to form a new population for the next-generation. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with seven evolutionary feature selection algorithms and two typical feature selection methods on 18 datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy than the compared methods on most of the used datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method can find different feature subsets with very similar or the same classification accuracy.

AB As one of the most import planning problems in container port operation, the allocation of berth template to all vessels scheduled to call at the port is concerned. This paper investigates the berth template management for container port of waterway-waterway transit, which is different from traditional import and export container ports. Aiming to reduce the container transit distance between the quay side and the yard side, two main evaluation indicators are proposed to maximize the connection between mother vessels and feeder vessels. On this basis, a two-stage mathematical model with four optimization objectives is developed. Numerical experiments are also conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and scenario analysis also shows the management insights for the container port of waterway-waterway transit.

AB Mental fatigue has a considerable influence on the completion of work as well as the safety and health of construction equipment operators who have been exposed to human-machine interaction for an extended period of time. Existing techniques of monitoring and measuring mental fatigue among construction equipment operators are either invasive or rely on subjective judgements, limiting their applicability on construction sites. Therefore, this paper developed a non-invasive smart cushion to evaluate the mental fatigue of construction equipment operators through real-time continuous monitoring of the heartbeat and respiration signals. A laboratory experiment was designed, and twelve participants were recruited to conduct the simulated excavator operation for data acquisition. First, wearable sensors were used as a reference to verify the monitoring accuracy of heartbeat and respiration signals. Excellent correlations were realized between the results of the two monitoring methods. Second, the relevant time domain and frequency domain features were extracted to construct a random forest classification model to discover the relationship between vital signs and subjectively reported mental fatigue status. The results demonstrated that the random forest model had a classification accuracy of 92%, better than other commonly used machine learning algorithms. A combination of heartbeat and respiration features is more effective than a single feature in identifying and classifying mental fatigue among construction equipment operators. The study's findings indicate that it is feasible to apply the smart cushion to identify and classify the mental fatigue of construction equipment operators, therefore contributing to the improvement of their health and safety.

AB Clustering-based methods have achieved impressive performance on unsupervised person ReID task. However, most of these models suffer from noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a novel method to evaluate and suppress noisy labels. Since the feature network is barely trained and the clustering results are unreliable consequently, noisy samples can be hardly screened out with a hard threshold in the early stage of training. To address this issue, we construct a Noisy Label Fuzzy Set (NLFS) whose membership function can be used to evaluate the noise level of each sample. Furthermore, we propose a new loss function, referred to as Bernoulli Random Noise Weighted Loss (BRNWL), with which some samples with higher noise membership will be recognized as noisy samples in higher probability and assigned with corresponding weights to limit their contributions to the training. Through above improvements, randomness is introduced into the alternating update between the feature network and the clustering results, which can effectively prevent the model from trapping into local minima or vicious circles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular ReID datasets.

AB Multi-agent pickup and delivery is the problem of allocating tasks for the agents and finding short paths for agents without collisions. These tasks enter the system in different time steps. This article proposes new approaches to this problem based on genetic algorithms in order to optimize the allocation of tasks, minimizing the makespan. We also address this problem as multiobjective, where makespan and service time are minimized. Computational experiments were performed varying the number of agents in a simulated environment of a large-scale warehouse. The results obtained by the proposed approaches were compared with those from the literature and the proposals demonstrated improvements in both objectives.

ID CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; AXIOMATIC DESIGN
AB According to the basic law of Design Science, new product design is based on existing design knowledge. Knowledge integration can be applied to product function design to shorten design time and improve the design quality through effective use of the existing knowledge. With the increase of the product design complexity and the number of design knowledge, it is harder and harder for traditional traversal-based algorithms to complete knowledge integration under acceptable time cost. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) based functional knowledge integration framework is proposed. The functional knowledge is represented by its input and output, and organized using a knowledge graph. The Q-network is constructed and trained for the deep Monte Carlo methodbased functional unit chain generation algorithm. The performance experiments show that comparing with the traditional searching algorithms, the RL based algorithm can provide same quality design scheme with much shorter time. The proposed algorithm is promising to realize real-time functional knowledge integration in largescale knowledge bases.

DE Transfer learning; Fault diagnosis; Maximum classifier discrepancy;
   Rolling bearing
AB As an effective method, deep transfer learning is used to solve the problem of unsupervised fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. In the process of obtaining domain invariant features, the feature matching at the domain-level does not consider the distribution of each category in matching the global distribution of source domain features and target domain features. To solve this problem, a class-level matching transfer learning network is proposed. In this method, source domain data and target domain data from different categories are matched first. Meanwhile, domain-level matching and class-level matching are combined based on the maximum classifier discrepancy structure. Then the transfer training process is divided into three stages: domain-level matching, class-level matching, and target domain pseudo-label direct guidance network training. The proposed method utilizes the target domain pseudo-label output by the network to extract the features of the target data by self-directing. Compared with the improved maximum classifier discrepancy on the Paderborn University dataset, the proposed method improves the fault diagnosis average accuracy by 12.95% on the six transfer tasks. It significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of unsupervised bearing fault diagnosis under various working conditions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of single row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is to assemble a full permutation of facilities along a straight line so that the weighted sum of pairwise distances is minimized. This category of layout positioning problem was proven to be NP-hard. In this work, a thin-provisioned and functionalized memetic algorithm (TPFMA) for solving this problem is developed. The three main contributions of TPFMA are as follows: (i) a fixed population of four individuals equipped with different roles helps to remove redundancy and maintain the balance between exploitation and exploration; (ii) a pairwise precedences-based crossover contributes to the rapid identification of common good genes; and (iii) a specific probabilistic model assists in repairing infeasible solutions and restarting the population in a low-cost, efficient way. In particular, evaluations over 43 small instances show that this method successfully achieves the optimum solution but employs considerably less computing time than its competitors over quite a few examples. Moreover, TPFMA improves 21 previous best results out of the 40 most challenging large instances when running for the same amount of computing time. The results on other SRFLP instances with up to 1000 facilities suggest that TPFMA matches the best known values for the 40 benchmark instances out of the total 50 instances.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells produce water as byproduct, which may cause electrode "flooding" and reduce cell performance. In operation, water usually builds up downstream in the gas flow channel due to the water production by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to a water spatial distribution. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented to analyze neutron radiography images to obtain water spatial variation under various operating conditions. 5 and 10 segments of a fuel cell are analyzed for spatial variations. Image pre-processing treatments are carried out to improve the convolutional neural network accuracy to 96.6%. The results show that liquid water emerges at a position around 55% downstream for 50% relative humidity while the entire cell is subject to two-phase flow for 100% relative humidity under a co-flow configuration. Large water content is present in most of the segments and the near-outlet segment for the counter-flow and co-flow configurations, respectively. In addition, the quad-serpentine cell exhibits more water accumulation than the single serpentine one in most downstream segments. The convolutional neural network results agree well with the data obtained from a pixelation image processing method with an accuracy of 91.8%. Compared with conventional pixelation methods, the convolutional neural network method performs better in speed for high-resolution images. It also shows that the current CNN tool fails to predict local water for small spatial scales, such as 10 segments, which leads to a large error (>27%) in prediction.

AB Electron microscopy (EM) enables high-resolution imaging of tissues and cells based on 2D and 3D imaging techniques. Due to the laborious and time-consuming nature of manual segmentation of large-scale EM datasets, automated segmentation approaches are crucial. This review focuses on the progress of deep learning-based segmentation techniques in large-scale cellular EM throughout the last six years, during which significant progress has been made in both semantic and instance segmentation. A detailed account is given for the key datasets that contributed to the proliferation of deep learning in 2D and 3D EM segmentation. The review covers supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning methods and examines how these algorithms were adapted to the task of segmenting cellular and sub-cellular structures in EM images. The special challenges posed by such images, like heterogeneity and spatial complexity, and the network architectures that overcame some of them are described. Moreover, an overview of the evaluation measures used to benchmark EM datasets in various segmentation tasks is provided. Finally, an outlook of current trends and future prospects of EM segmentation is given, especially with large-scale models and unlabeled images to learn generic features across EM datasets.

AB Accurate estimation of the internal temperatures of electric machines is critical to increasing their power density and reliability since key temperatures, such as magnet temperature, are often difficult to measure. This work presents a new machine learning based modelling approach, incorporating novel physically informed feature engineering, which achieves best-in-class accuracy and reduced training time. The different features introduced are proportional to sources of machine losses and require no prior knowledge of the machine, hence the models are completely data driven. Evaluation using a standard experimental dataset shows that modelling errors can be reduced by up to 82.5%, resulting in the lowest mean squared error recorded in the literature of 2.40 K-2. Additionally, models can be trained with less training data and have lower sensitivity to data quality. Specifically, it was possible to train a loss enhanced multilayer perceptron model to a mean squared error <5 K-2 with 90 h of training data, and an enhanced ordinary least squares model with just 60 h to the same criteria. The inference time of the model can be 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than competing models and requires no time to optimise hyperparameters, compared to weeks or months for other state-of-the-art prediction methods. These results are highly important for enabling low-cost real-time temperature monitoring of electric machines to improve operational efficiency, safety, reliability, and power density.

AB Accurate 3D contrast-free myocardial infarction (MI) delineation has the potential to eliminate the need for toxic injections, thereby significantly advances diagnosis and treatment of MI. In this study, we propose a 4D dual-stream spatiotemporal feature learning framework (4D-DSS) that enables learning of 4D (3D + T) representation of the heart to accurately map the 3D MI regions, thereby directly delineating of 3D MI without contrast agent. This framework creatively introduces a dual-stream 3D spatiotemporal point cloud architecture enables to learn the myocardial 4D representation in both local and global aspects, and improve the comprehension and precision of the representation. Specifically, the framework utilizes the local spatiotemporal variation of individual point clouds to characterize minute distortions in myocardial regions and the global spatiotemporal variation of point cloud sequences to represent the overall myocardial motion between frames, thereby enables comprehensive learning of 3D myocardial motion and leverages these features to classify myocardial tissue into MI regions and normal regions. 4D-DSS significantly improved performance (with a precision increase of at least 4%) compared to four advanced methods. The results support the impact of our 4D-DSS framework on the development and implementation of 3D contrast-free myocardial infarction region delineation technology.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID PREDICTION; TASK
AB There is recent interest in using model hubs - a collection of pre-trained models - in computer vision tasks. To employ a model hub, we first select a source model and then adapt the model for the target to compensate for differences. There still needs to be more research on model selection and adaption for renewable power forecasts. In particular, none of the related work examines different model selection and adaptation strategies for neural network architectures. Also, none of the current studies investigates the influence of available training samples and considers seasonality in the evaluation. We close these gaps by conducting the first thorough experiment for model selection and adaptation for transfer learning in renewable power forecast, adopting recent developments from the field of computer vision on 667 wind and photovoltaic parks from six datasets. We simulate different amounts of training samples for each season to calculate informative forecast errors. We examine the marginal likelihood and forecast error for model selection for those amounts. Furthermore, we study four adaption strategies. As an extension of the current state of the art, we utilize a Bayesian linear regression for forecasting the response based on features extracted from a neural network. This approach outperforms the baseline with only seven days of training data and shows that fine-tuning is not beneficial with less than three months of data. We further show how combining multiple models through ensembles can significantly improve the model selection and adaptation approach such that we have a similar mean error with only 30 days of training data which is otherwise only possible with an entire year of training data. We achieve a mean error of 9.8 and 14 percent for the most realistic dataset for PV and wind with only seven days of training data.

ID MODEL
AB Power quality challenges have generated a lot of disputes between utilities, customers, network operators, and equipment manufacturers around the world as regards the share of responsibility for power quality solutions, this results in different levels of financial and technical losses for both the network operators and the customers. One of the major consequences of the operation of heavy-duty factories globally is the corruption of power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC). In order to quantify the harmonics contribution at the PCC by industrial consumers, this paper presents three-phase total harmonics distortion of current (THDi) prediction model at the PCC. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) models use a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPN) to predict three-phase total harmonic distortion. The input parameter used in the models is easily measured with basic power meters. The model was trained with input parameters captured at 33 kV and 132 kV voltage levels using power quality meters at five (5) different steel manufacturing plants. Eight (8) different models were designed, trained, validated, and tested with different combinations of input parameters, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in the hidden layer. The results show that the model with two hidden layers which uses four major power parameters (Current, apparent power, reactive and active power) as input parameters in the training model had the best performance with a 95.5% coefficient of correlation between the measured THDi and the predicted THDi.

AB An ultimate objective in continual learning is to preserve knowledge learned in preceding tasks while learning new tasks. To mitigate forgetting prior knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge distillation technique that takes into the account the manifold structure of the latent/output space of a neural network in learning novel tasks. To achieve this, we propose to approximate the data manifold up to its first order, hence benefiting from linear subspaces to model the structure and maintain the knowledge of a neural network while learning novel concepts. We demonstrate that the modeling with subspaces provides several intriguing properties, including robustness to noise and therefore effective for mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in continual learning. We also discuss and show how our proposed method can be adopted to address both classification and segmentation problems. Empirically, we observe that our proposed method outperforms various continual learning methods on several challenging datasets including Pascal VOC, and Tiny-Imagenet. Furthermore, we show how the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing learning approaches to improve their performances.

AB This paper addresses the flexible job shop scheduling problem with controllable processing times (FJSP-CPT). The objective is to simultaneously minimize makespan and total energy consumption. To solve the problem, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed, and then the epsilon method is used to obtain the optimal Pareto front for small-scale instances. In order to obtain approximate Pareto fronts for medium-and large-sized problems, we propose an efficient multi-objective hybrid shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (MO-HS-FLA). In the proposed MO-HSFLA, the encoding method, the decoding method, the initiation method of the population and the evolution processes are designed. Specifically, an energy-efficient decoding with three energy-saving strategies, namely decelerating, Turning Off/On and postponing, is designed. In addition, a multi -objective variable local search (MO-VNS) algorithm is designed and embedded in the algorithm to enhance its local exploitation capability. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed MILP model and MO-HFSLA.

AB Although substantial progress in safety management performance has been made in the construction industry, continuing fatalities and injuries at workplaces hinder sustainable development of this labor-intensive industry. Many machine learning approaches using different types of data such as text, image, video, and audio were adopted for safety risk analysis at construction sites. Our paper aimed to implement a hybrid review of construction safety research based upon machine learning. This hybrid review focused on various attributes from three perspectives: Nature of dataset, machine learning approach, and research topic. After the review of individual attributes, intra-relationships between attributes in each perspective and inter-relationships between attributes across the three perspectives were determined. According to risk recognition, risk prediction, and risk control, feasible research paths were developed from both intra-relationships and inter-relationships between multiple attributes for reference in future studies. Finally, gaps and opportunities were discussed in detail for research agendas on this subject. This hybrid review contributes to outlining the framework of construction safety management based upon machine learning. It is able to provide new entrants with a systematic idea of promising research trends for the future. Research findings are helpful for academia and industry to fill in the gaps between study and practice in the area of construction safety, in order to assist in sustainable development of the construction industry by use of machine learning.

ID OPTIMAL SCALE SELECTION; ROUGH APPROXIMATION; DECISION TABLES
AB Knowledge reduction is an essential issue in data mining. However, most of the existing studies consider the problem of knowledge reduction in a single-scale system. When the system expands to a multi-scale information system (MIS), the existing methods are not available. To overcome this challenge, we design a universal framework to reduce attributes and select optimal scales (OSs) based on the dominance relation in ordered information systems (OISs). Firstly, we analyze the effect of scale on rough approximations and correlation measures in multi-scale ordered information systems (MOISs). Secondly, the relation between attribute reduction and OS selection is explored in OISs. Moreover, the corresponding algorithms are designed around both tasks. Due to our universal framework considering the decisions at the finest, optimal and coarsest scale, our study is an extension of the three-way decision. Thirdly, a novel MOIS construction algorithm is explored to transform an OIS into an MIS. Thus, the proposed reduction algorithms can be operated in any OIS. Experiments substantiate that models trained by data at the OS can improve their stability and the attribute reduction task is also suitable for the proposed algorithm. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, multiple featured machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms are applied in forecasting the electric vehicles charging load profile from real datasets of Spain's electrical grid. The study aims to provide realistic datasets of electric vehicle load profiles to cope with the potential increase in electric vehicle penetration taking into consideration the seasonality effects. Technical issues are caused by the distribution network of the electricity grid; such as the huge charging power and stochastic charging behaviors of the drivers of electric vehicles due to the mass rollout of electric vehicles. Forecasting electric vehicles' load profile is necessary to face challenges to solve the problem of the potential mass rollout of electric vehicles penetration. However, Electric vehicle is considered one of the most promising solutions that develops faster than other stochastic renewable solution to reduce greenhouse emissions. The seasonality effect is one of the huge challenges on electrical loads, so it is investigated by creating four separate forecasting networks to increase system accuracy and studying the effect of seasonal factors such as temperature fluctuation in the four seasons affecting the electric vehicles' battery in charging and draining modes. These factors are affecting the accuracy of the forecasting model. Four featured algorithms are investigated. Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference Systems are applied as machine learning algorithms, and Long Short-Term Memory and the Gated Recurrent Units are also utilized as deep learning algorithms. The Gated Recurrent Units model performs slightly better than the long short-term memor y employed on the hourly average daily historical data of charging electric vehicles. While the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System gathers both Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Inference System advantages.

AB The advancements in distributed generation (DG) technologies such as solar panels have led to a widespread integration of renewable power generation in modern power systems. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy poses new challenges to the network operational planning with underlying uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic scheme for renewable solar power generation forecasting by addressing data and model parameter uncertainties using Bayesian bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks, while handling the high dimensionality in weight parameters using variational auto-encoders (VAE). The forecasting performance of the proposed method is evaluated using various deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics such as root-mean square error (RMSE), Pinball loss, etc. Furthermore, reconstruction error and computational time are also monitored to evaluate the dimensionality reduction using the VAE component. When compared with benchmark methods, the proposed method leads to significant improvements in weight reduction, i.e., from 76,4224 to 2,022 number of weight parameters, quantifying to 97.35% improvement in weight parameters reduction and 37.93% improvement in computational time for 6 months of solar power generation data.

AB Differential Evolution (DE) -type algorithms perform efficiently on optimization problems, but for some problems, single DE-type algorithms still cannot achieve good results. Integrating multiple algorithms or strategies is an effective way to improve the performance of a single algorithm. This paper proposes a cascaded DE-type algorithm optimization framework with population adaptive allocation and reduction (cDE-APAR), which improves the performance of a single algorithm by cascading two DE-type algorithms and combining related strategies. The first stage of the algorithm runs a single algorithm. The second stage implements the other algorithm in parallel with a local search strategy and a global search strategy, and allocates resources reasonably among the single algorithm and related strategies through adaptive population allocation. Finally, individuals with the worst performance are eliminated through the population reduction strategy to improve the population's quality. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, extensive simulations were performed using four test suites of CEC2005, CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017. The results show that cDE-APAR significantly improves the performance of a single algorithm. Compared with nine state-of-the-art algorithms, cDEAPAR is significantly better than the comparison algorithms according to the Wilcoxon rank sum test and has significantly improved the accuracy and stability of the solution.

DE Cross -modality person re -identification; Attention mechanism; Image

AB Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging problem of matching a person from visible and infrared modalities. Existing researches adopt the last convolutional layer features of the off-the-shelf backbone network as the representation to refine, which is unable to represent the heterogeneous cross-modality features with discriminant information. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based aggregation learning network (GALNet) with visual Transformer embedding to mine both multi-layer features and part-level contextual cues for VI-ReID. We propose a novel feature memory module (FMM) to reserve global discriminative features of the low layers with the correlation modeling ability of the graph convolution network (GCN) which is supplemented to the final person representation. To learn more discriminant part-level features, an attentive part aggregation module (PAM) is designed to mine part relationships, leveraging the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer. By fusing these components, the global-level, and part-level discriminant information can be utilized. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

AB As construction noise negatively affects the health and quality of life of stakeholders, field managers need to properly monitor and manage noise. Thus, the authors developed a model that estimates real-time noise levels at a construction site and the surroundings to enable preemptive responses to noise-related issues. To accurately estimate noise, necessary field data were collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and noise sensors. The noise estimation model was composed of two sub-models: the noise-customized spatial interpolation model and the noise propagation model. The noise-customized spatial interpolation model was developed to estimate the internal noise of the construction site using a few sensor noise levels. Meanwhile, the noise propagation model was developed to estimate the noise level outside the construction site using internal noise estimation results, obstacles, weather information, and noise sources information. The model was evaluated through field tests at a construction technology demonstration center, environments identical to real construction sites in South Korea. The model showed satisfactory performance, with an accuracy of 96.71% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.62 for the internal construction site noise and an accuracy of 96.03% and an RMSE of 2.70 for outside the construction site. To facilitate the usage of the noise estimation results for field managers, the research team visualized the results using the Unity 3D Engine. The results will enable field managers to assess workers' long-term noise exposure and respond to potential civil complaints, gearing up to realize environ-mental, social, and governance (ESG) goals in the construction industry.

A new approach to this problem based on cooperative game theory and optimization called the Shapley Influence Maximization Extremal Optimization approach is proposed. The influence maximization problem for the independent cascade model is considered as a cooperative game, where players seek to choose seeder nodes to maximize the size of the influence set of their cascade model by maximizing their average marginal contribution to all possible coalitions. Numerical experiments con-ducted on both synthetic and real-world networks and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms show the potential of the proposed approach. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The conventional path planning problem for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) typically involves a pre-defined environment and mission, with the objective of reaching a single target point. However, in order to perform different missions, the agent must be trained from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new path planning algorithm for UAVs by training them to be controlled by subgoals, which enhances their degree of freedom to perform various maneuvers. The subgoals can be defined by the user and given to the agent in real-time, allowing the UAV to perform diverse flight missions without prior knowledge of the environment. To achieve this, we utilize goal-conditioned reinforcement learning to train the UAV agent to reach various goals by learning different flight maneuvers. In experiments, we designed specific scenarios to test the UAV agent's ability to perform concrete missions, such as high-flying, low-flying, penetrating, and bypassing. The experimental results show that the same UAV agent trained in a simple environment can accomplish difficult missions in various scenarios. The pre-trained UAV agent can be utilized in other environments as it can be controlled by the subgoals. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an integrated slab allocation problem (ISAP) is investigated, aiming to optimise inventory management in the steel production process of hot rolling. Different from previous studies, three sets of decisions are made simultaneously. The first is to allocate open-order slabs to orders to reduce inventory slabs and improve slab utilisation. The second is to reallocate customer-order slabs to orders to shorten the order completion time and improve customer satisfaction. The third is to group the remaining open-order slabs into virtual orders to ensure continuous production and reduce inventory pressure. The problem is formulated as an original integer programming mathematical model. A novel improved differential evolution algorithm with self-adaptive mutation and parameter selection strategies is proposed to solve the ISAP. In particular, a special encoding and decoding method is designed to address the issue of transformation between the slab allocation scheme and algorithm individual. A density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm and random swap local search are embedded into the framework of the differential evolution algorithm. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm, and the numerical results demonstrate its superiority in solving the ISAP.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of EEG signals, the manifold becomes a new direction to analyze EEG signals. However, the problem of imbalanced epileptic seizure data and limited labeling data results in insufficient training data. The significant difference in feature distribution between cross-subject EEG signals also affects model generalization. A manifold transfer learning method based on divergence alignment (MTLDA) was proposed to overcome the few-shot problem. By constructing an objective function based on domain divergence, the transformation matrix is obtained to reduce the feature distribution difference between source and target domains. Additionally, for less labeled data on the manifold, a Riemannian manifold fuzzy clustering (RMFC) was proposed to realize unsupervised pattern recognition of the sample on the manifold. MTLDA and RMFC use Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean rather than the classical Euclidean distance and mean. Both methods do not require labeling information from subjects. The experiment results on two public datasets and one private dataset show that MTLDA and RMFC are effective and outperform other comparison algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to better understand and analyze population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, this paper proposed a new hybrid algorithm combined Levy flight with modified Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) , which is called LMWOAGWO to discard the dross and select the essence. Firstly, the population is initialized by using the uniform distribution space combined with the pseudo-reverse learning strategy, which lays the foundation for global search. Then, modifications were made to both WOA and GWO. For WOA algorithm, random adjustment control parameters strategy and different chaotic maps are used to adjust the main parameters of WOA to avoid the algorithm falling into local optimum in the later stage. For GWO algorithm, a new optimal solution is added to the grey wolf population to increase the optimal update position of the algorithm. On this basis, the dynamic weighting strategy is introduced to improve the convergence accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm. Subsequently, new conditions were added during the WOA exploitation phase to formulate LMWOAGWO and the greedy strategy is used to retain better iteration update locations. Finally, Levy flight is used to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted using 23 standard test benchmark functions, 25 CEC2005 functions, 15 popular benchmark functions and 10 CEC2019 functions to test the performance of LMWOAGWO compared with other well-known swarm optimization algorithms. Experimental and statistical results show that the performance of LMWOAGWO algorithm is better than many state-of-the-art algorithms. Then, 22 real-world optimization problems were used to further study the effectiveness of LMWOAGWO. Winners of CEC2020 Real World Single Objective Constraint Optimization Competition, such as iLSHADE & epsilon; algorithm, sCMAgES algorithm, COLSHADE algorithm and EnMODE algorithm are selected as four comparison algorithms in real world optimization problems. Experimental results show that the proposed LMWOAGWO has the capability to solve real world optimization problems. Finally, the application efficiency of LMWOAGWO in solving two basic optimization problems in wireless networks is briefly introduced, and compared with the original WOA and GWO. Simulation results show that the performance of the LMWOAGWO is better than WOA and GWO. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The recently proposed swarm intelligence algorithm, Runge-Kutta Optimization (RUN), is rooted in the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Compared with its counterparts, RUN boasts an advantage of having a more concrete theoretical foundation embodying a more powerful optimization efficacy, free from any metaphor. However, RUN still has its shortcomings. The compelling enhanced solution function leads to insufficient exploration ability of the algorithm, and resulting in an imbalance between exploration and exploitation that cannot be mitigated. An improved version based on opposition-based learning and cuckoo search is proposed to compensate for the above deficiencies, called OCRUN. OCRUN is tested on 30 test functions of CEC2014 with 10 classical metaheuristics and 9 advanced metaheuristics, respectively. Combining the experimental results and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, OCRUN exhibits excellent performance. At the same time, parameter sensitivity analysis experiments are also carried out on this test set. Furthermore, a binary implementation of the algorithm was constructed specifically for feature selection cases, labeled as BOCRUN. BOCRUN is compared with 5 existing binary metaheuristics on 15 public datasets. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm performs well in feature selection. Therefore, OCRUN is an effectively improved optimizer. Finally, the OCRUN method offers high-quality solutions to engineering problems and contributes significantly to engineering design under practical constraints. The method has been successfully applied to various design scenarios, such as reducer design, cantilever beam design, and tension/compression spring design. The OCRUN method outperforms other similar products in terms of performance and effectiveness. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Software testing represents a crucial component of software development, and it is usually making the difference between successful and failed projects. Although it is extremely important, due to the fast pace and short deadlines of contemporary projects it is often neglected or not detailed enough due to the lack of available time, leading to the potential loss of reputation, private users' data, money, and even lives in some circumstances. In such situations, it would be vital to have the option to predict what modules are error-prone according to the collection of software metrics, and to focus testing on them, and that task is a typical classification task. Machine learning models have been frequently employed within a wide range of classification problems with significant success, and this paper proposes eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to execute the defect prediction task. A modified variant of the well-known reptile search optimization algorithm has been suggested to carry out the calibrating of the XGBoost hyperparameters. The enhanced algorithm was named HARSA and evaluated on the collection of challenging CEC2019 benchmark functions, where it exhibited excellent performance. Later, the introduced XGBoost model that uses the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two benchmark software testing datasets, and the simulation outcomes have been compared to other powerful swarm intelligence metaheuristics that were used in the identical experimental environment, where the proposed approach attained superior classification accuracy on both datasets. Finally, Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was conducted to discover the impact of various software metrics on the classification results.<br />& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many social domains involving collective decision-making (e.g., committee selection and survey sampling), it is often desirable to select individuals from different population groups to achieve proportional representation (e.g., to represent the opinions of each group). For instance, in the selection of a committee (e.g., to form a working group within a company), the planner would like to select agents from different groups to represent their respective groups proportionally. Typically, there are intrinsic private costs for agents to represent their groups, and the planner would like to compensate the selected agents via some form of payments, which is constrained by the planner's available budget. As the costs are unknown to the planner, the planner is required to design incentive mechanisms to elicit agents' real costs and provide payments (or monetary incentives) to the selected agents to ensure proportional representation and the total payments do not exceed the budget. Such a mechanism design setting falls into the budget-feasible mechanism design paradigm. However, existing budget-feasible mechanisms only consider all agents to be in the same group with non-proportional objectives. To study the above-mentioned setting, we consider the problem of designing budget-feasible mechanisms for selecting agents with private costs from various groups to ensure proportional representation, where the minimum proportion of the overall value of the selected agents from each group is maximized. We study this problem by first considering the setting with homogeneous agents who have identical values to the planner. Depending on agents' membership in the groups, we consider two models: a single group model where each agent belongs to only one group, and a multiple group model where each agent may belong to multiple groups. We propose novel budget-feasible proportion-representative mechanisms for these models that require different selection methods, i.e., a novel greedy mechanism that considers all possible proportion ratios for the single group model and a novel mechanism that leverages the Max-Flow algorithm to evaluate the proportional representation for the multiple group model, to choose representative agents from each group. The proposed mechanisms guarantee theoretical properties of individual rationality, budget-feasibility, truthfulness, and approximation performance on maximizing the minimum proportional representation of each group. We also provide a matching lower bound for budget-feasible proportion-representative mechanisms. Finally, we non-trivially extend these mechanisms to the settings of heterogeneous agents who can have different values to the planner under the two models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As an important extension of conventional text-only neural machine translation (NMT), multi-modal neural machine translation (MNMT) aims to translate input source sentences paired with images into the target language. Although a lot of MNMT models have been proposed to perform multi-modal semantic fusion, they do not consider fine-grained semantic correspondences between semantic units of different modalities (i.e., words and visual objects), which can be exploited to refine multi-modal representation learning via fine-grained semantic interactions. To address this issue, we propose a graph-based multi -modal fusion encoder for NMT. Concretely, we first employ a unified multi-modal graph to represent the input sentence and image, in which the multi-modal semantic units are considered as the nodes in the graph, connected by two kinds of edges with different semantic relationships. Then, we stack multiple graph-based multi-modal fusion layers that iteratively conduct intra-and inter-modal interactions to learn node representations. Finally, via an attention mechanism, we induce a multi-modal context from the top node representations for the decoder. Particularly, we introduce a progressive contrastive learning strategy based on the multi-modal graph to refine the training of our proposed model, where hard negative samples are introduced gradually. To evaluate our model, we conduct experiments on commonly-used datasets. Experimental results and analysis show that our MNMT model obtains significant improvements over competitive baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Multi30K dataset.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Trajectory planning tasks for non-holonomic or collaborative systems are naturally modeled by state spaces with non-Euclidean metrics. However, existing proofs of convergence for sample-based motion planners only consider the setting of Euclidean state spaces. We resolve this issue by formulating a flexible framework and set of assumptions for which the widely-used PRM*, RRT, and RRT* algorithms remain asymptotically optimal in the non-Euclidean setting. The framework is compatible with collaborative trajectory planning: given a fleet of robotic systems that individually satisfy our assumptions, we show that the corresponding collaborative system again satisfies the assumptions and therefore has guaranteed convergence for the trajectory-finding methods. Our joint state space construction builds in a coupling parameter 1 <= p <= 8, which interpolates between a preference for minimizing total energy at one extreme and a preference for minimizing the travel time at the opposite extreme. We illustrate our theory with trajectory planning for simple coupled systems, fleets of Reeds-Shepp vehicles, and a highly non-Euclidean fractal space.

AB Co-modality transportation aims to integrate passenger and freight flows into a single system by sharing public transport between passengers and freight. This paper proposes a crowdsourced co-modality transportation system (CCTS) for enhancing the practical implementation of co-modality transportation in urban areas. Firstly, empirical investigations are conducted, including semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners and online surveys with passengers, to collect system design considerations. Secondly, an overview of the crowdsourced co-modality management platform (CCMP) is presented by highlighting three key components: comodality services, information infrastructure, and decision support system. Thirdly, we formulate the parcel assignment problem in the CCTS and examine the factors that influence the performance of the CCTS. The empirical investigations suggest that crowdsourced passengers care about the potential risks and the degree of operation difficulty in crowdsourced activities but do not care about privacy issues. In addition, the experimental studies show that crowdsourced co-modality is more feasible and promising if more passengers are willing to provide crowdsourcing services.

AB Deep Learning is one of the promising branches of artificial intelligence and has made phased progress in medical diagnosis. Widely used Convolution Neural Network (CNN) methods require considerable data to train the models to be comparable to professionals. However, it is difficult to acquire medical data in real life to support the application of the CNN methods due to its industrial particularity. Besides, CNN is easy to lose the spatial relationships among the features, which is caused by pooling. The emergence of Capsule Network (CapsNet) effectively alleviates these problems. Nonetheless, CapsNet has an obvious drawback of overlearning: it is prone to learning the noise latent in the image. The named dynamic routing algorithm may lead to the degeneration of capsules on some datasets as the routing iteration increases, making inaccurate diagnoses. This paper proposes a Bayes- Pearson routing CapsNet (BP-CapsNet) with a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) module to solve the above problems and process medical images to achieve an adequate diagnosis. The proposed method's effectiveness was evaluated by training and testing the entire model on seven distinct medical image datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets and the greatest accuracy on another two datasets. The simulation results show that the method can significantly reduce the impact of noise, achieving effective diagnosis and potent generality.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the impressive predictive performance exhibited by deep learning across various domains, its application in research models within the social and behavioral sciences has been limited. Deep learning lacks human-accessible interpretability and does not provide statistical inferences. To address these limitations, this article presents a novel model-agnostic hypothesis testing framework tailored to scalar regression problems using deep artificial neural networks. The new framework not only determines each input variable's direction of influence and statistical significance, but computes effect size measures akin to Cohen's f2 in traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Effect sizes are an important complement to null hypothesis significance testing by providing a practical significance measure that is independent of sample size considerations. To showcase the usefulness of the new framework, its application is demonstrated on both an artificial data set and a social survey using a Python sandbox implementation. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Portfolio optimization is an essential and practical model for financial decision making. With the consideration of some real-world constraints, especially the cardinality constraints, the problem becomes much more challenging as it converts to a mixed-integer quadratic multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a knowledge-based constructive estimation of distribution algorithm (KC-EDA) with the following three features. First, a hybrid design of Ant colony optimization (ACO) and Estimation distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to solve this mixed-variable optimization problem based on knowledge information. Second, a knowledge accumulation mechanism is designed to discover the internal relationship among the assets. The mechanism can not only guide the selection of assets effectively but also enable the use of historical information during evolution to direct the allocation of investment proportion. Third, a constructive approach is applied to construct portfolios under the constraints. This hybrid and constructive approach is incorporated into the multiobjective evolutionary framework and the experiment has been performed on the SZ50, SZ180, and SZ380 datasets (from January 2014 to December 2018). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of KC-EDA in solving the portfolio optimization problem with cardinality constraints.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID SUBJECT
AB This paper presents the concept of the computationally-efficient reduced order control performance assessment (RO-CPA) system for automatic detection of industrial single closed loop control systems whose performance could be not acceptable due to a poor tuning of the controller. The proposed machine learning (ML) based classification system is derived for a broad class of industrial control closed loops based on the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Apart from a high accuracy of the classification of the closed loop performance, the proposed RO-CPA system is derived to meet the requirements of low computational complexity and low memory usage. These requirements allow for practical implementation of RO-CPA in devices with low computational and memory resources, such as industrial programmable logic controllers (PLC) operating in manufacturing systems or embedded autonomous systems with dedicated PID-based control loops. This paper shows the rigorous ML-based design of the proposed RO-CPA system and the results of the validation of its classification accuracy. Additionally, an example of a practical implementation within a PLC in the form of a general purpose library function block is presented and the final experimental validation is made using a part of laboratory heat exchange and distribution setup. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to societal changes and modernization in the world, various technologies and businesses have changed. Technology start-up enterprises are currently increasingly gaining attention in Thailand. However, for a technology start-up to be successful is not an easy path. Critical success factors (CSFs) from experts are necessary at the start. In this research two sectors: general technology (GeneralTech) and deep technology (DeepTech) are investigated. Entrepreneurs who wish to shift their businesses from GeneralTech to DeepTech can also understand what they have to focus on in running a relevant and successful business. Fuzzy Logarithmic Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-LF) has been applied to rank the CSFs for technology start-ups. This newly developed method has been compared with the existing methods; Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming method (LFPP) and Fuzzy Logarithmic Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-F). The results have shown that the FUCOM-LF has advantages over existing methods because it uses a smaller number of pairwise comparisons with full consistency and it can get reliable results based on evaluated data. It is also not necessary to defuzzify the final value like FUCOM-F. The findings reveal that the three main CSFs for GeneralTech start-ups in Thailand are market and customer, key persons, and value propositions, while CSFs for DeepTech start-ups are market and customer, value propositions, and key persons, respectively. To shift from GeneralTech start-ups to DeepTech start-ups entrepreneurs should enhance their value propositions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a novel representative of the existing family of ordered weighted aggregation (OWA) operators with constant orness (optimism/pessimism level). In other words, orness value of weight vectors generated using the proposed operator is independent of the total number of arguments. The proposed OWA operator is the operator that is based on the beta function. Two different types of operators have been proposed with respect to the level of optimism ("or-like") and pessimism ("and-like") each. In addition to that the proposed operators discussed here are bi-parametric and realvalued in nature in terms of their parameters. Hence, for a given orness value (optimism or pessimism), it provides an infinite number of weight vectors as the proposed operator's orness depends on the value of one of its parameters. These properties lead to lots of flexibility for the Decision-Maker (DM). Its comparison and advantages over other existing members of the OWA family with constant orness such as S-OWA operators have been elaborated. Also, the maximum Renyi entropy of the OWA (MRE-OWA) operator and the maximum Renyi entropy of the proposed OWA operator are compared and evaluated for a specified orness level. Several other important properties and applications of the family of the proposed operators have also been analyzed in detail.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The development and deployment of robots on construction sites are integral to the industrialization of construction, known as Construction 4.0. Tele-operated and pre-programmed robots have enhanced construction efficiency and safety. However, their utilization on-site remains limited due to the need for expert remote control and the lack of adaptability in dynamic environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution, as RL-controlled robots possess inherent self-learning abilities to adapt to diverse situations. Nevertheless, manual design of RL reward functions for complex tasks poses challenges. To address this issue, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), have been proposed to learn optimal actions through expert demonstration and self-exploration, without explicitly defined reward functions. In this study, we propose an innovative approach integrating GAIL and virtual reality (VR) integrated robot control approach to control robots for long-horizon collaborative construction tasks involving multiple sub-tasks. We employ VR expert demonstrations as input for GAIL training, enabling a team of robots, including an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and two robot arms, to interact with the designed RL environment and perform tasks such as transporting, picking, and installing window panels. Handle long-horizon collaborative construction tasks (i.e., a long sequence of several sub-tasks performed by multiple robots). For evaluation, we compare the performance of our VR-GAIL model with a prevalent and robust RL baseline model, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The results demonstrate that our reward-free VR-GAIL model achieves, on average, a 4.5% higher success rate than the PPO counterpart equipped with carefully designed reward functions across all three sub-tasks and their randomized variations. Furthermore, the performance gap between GAIL and PPO widens as the task difficulty increases. These findings indicate that our approach effectively enhances RL agent performance in tackling complex construction tasks while expediting development by eliminating reward function design requirements.

AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extensively used for dozens of image enhancement and image translation applications, where several traditional and novel architectures have been and are still being introduced. However, the classical training protocols do not fully explore the significant potential of such architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional GAN (cGAN) framework called competitive multi-generator based cGAN (CMcGAN) for more effective training progress and enhanced image generation. Different from classical adversarial learning protocols, the generators of a CMcGAN are not only challenged by the discriminator for improved performance, but also by other generators. This is achieved by a sharing mechanism, where the current performances of the competing generators are shared among each other, motivating each generator to perform better than the rest. Extensive experiments in several conditional image generation applications show the significant improvements achieved by several traditional architectures when trained following our proposed learning strategy. Moreover, these architectures, trained by our learning strategy, outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches proposed in each tested application.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the arrival of the AI era, traditional product design, which relied on professional designers, has transformed into participatory design, which depends on the intellect of the public. Collective intelligence design (CID) is a novel paradigm that depends on pooling and releasing the intelligence of the masses to drive product design. Because the CID's open, shared, and collaborative characteristics are similar to those of natural ecosystems, an analogy can be drawn and the concept of a collective intelligence design ecosystem (CIDE) proposed. The CIDE is a dynamic system that evolves with the iteration of the product design process. Sensing the evolutionary state of CIDE and identifying factors that threaten CIDE instability can provide targeted recommendations for rapid and accurate improvement of CIDE's adaptive capacity. However, the problem has yet to be effectively solved. Therefore, this research provides a comprehensive assessment index system based on an ecological network model that can completely measure the evolutionary condition of CIDE. The method's effectiveness was validated by applying it to the Zhubajie platform, China's largest CID platform. The conclusions provide a new perspective for perceiving the evolutionary state of CIDE.

AB The detection of malware is a complex problem in the area of Internet security. Developing a malware defense system that is less costly to detect large-scale malware is needed. This paper proposes a novel malware detection and classification architecture based on image visualization as SDIF-CNN: Stacking deep image features using fine-tuned convolution neural networks. The hybrid methodology of transfer learning as fine-tuning and feature extractor of deep convolution neural network models is designed. At first, the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model is deeply fine-tuned with different hyperparameters, including the number of layers, learning rate, momentum, etc. The transfer learning-based fine-tuned VGG16 model is used as a feature extractor along with the three similar pre-trained CNN models, VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, to obtain the diverse feature map. The extracted features are horizontally concatenated to construct a single feature map. The different feature selection methodologies, including filter-based methods and embedded methods, such as linear regression and random forest, are designed to discard the irrelevant features from a stacked feature map. After that, this study uses six machine learning and deep learning classifiers- K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extra Tree (ET), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) by using the stacked feature map as a training feature vector. The hyperparameter optimization of the MLP model as the best classifier is performed using a randomized search algorithm to devise an optimal classifier. The experiments are performed using a publicly benchmarked MalImg dataset of 9339 images from 25 families. The model is also validated on real-world and packed malicious programs to prove the generalization of the proposed methodology in detecting real-world malware. In the proposed system, the MLP model obtained the best performance results as 98.55% accuracy, 99% precision, 99% recall, and 99% F1-score for MalImg datasets, and accuracy of 94.78% for real-world malware datasets. The proposed methodology is resilient to commonly used obfuscation techniques and does not depend upon code disassembly, reverse engineering analysis, and highly resource-intensive dynamic analysis. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The self-labeled methods can enlarge the labeled set by continuously adding pseudo-labeled data from the unlabeled set and predicted by base classifiers. Mislabeling is a great challenge for self -labeled methods due to their generalization performance depending on the correct prediction of pseudo-labeled data. Existing solutions of self-labeled methods or frameworks employ data editing techniques based on traditional instance selection methods or differential evolution to overcome mislabeling. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the following issues: (a) data editing techniques based on traditional instance selection methods heavily rely on specific assumptions and some are not easily extended to other self-labeled methods; (b) the differential evolution may distort the original data distribution. To overcome mislabeling and the above issues in existing solutions, a novel framework based on sample subspace optimization for self-labeled semi-supervised classification (SSO-SLSSC) is proposed. SSO-SLSSC is a wrapping framework and can be highly compatible with most existing self-labeled methods. First, SSO-SLSSC can employ almost any self-labeled method to perform the iterative self-labeled process. Second, during the iterative self-labeled process, a binary particle swarm optimization-based sample subspace optimization (BPSOSSO) is innovatively proposed to select a subset containing correctly predicted pseudo-labeled data from newly predicted data and filter out the subset containing mislabeled data from newly predicted samples. Experimental results have proven that SSO-SLSSC outperforms 2 representative self-labeled frameworks and 5 advanced data editing techniques in overcoming mislabeling of 4 popular self-labeled methods on extensive benchmark data sets from UCI and Kaggle with different ratios of initial labeled samples and noise. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The evolutionary algorithm has become a major method for neural architecture search recently. However, the fixed probability distribution employed by the traditional evolutionary algorithm may lead to structural complexity and redundancy due to its inability to control the size of individual architectures, and it cannot learn from empirical information gathered during the search process to guide the subsequent search more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, evaluating the performance of all the searched architectures requires significant computing resources and time overhead. To overcome these challenges, we present the Efficient Self-learning Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ESE-NAS) method. Firstly, we propose an Adaptive Learning Strategy for Mutation Sampling, composed of a Model Size Control module and a Credit Assignment method for Mutation Candidates, to guide the search process by learning from the model size information and evaluation results of the architectures and adjusting the probability distributions for evolution sampling accordingly. Additionally, we developed a neural architecture performance predictor to further improve the efficiency of NAS. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that ESE-NAS significantly brings forward the first hitting time of the optimal architectures and reaches a competitive performance level with classic manual-designed and NAS models while maintaining structural simplicity and efficiency.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Meta-learning-based methods prevail in few-shot text classification. Current methods perform meta -training and meta-testing on two parts of a dataset in the same or similar domains. This results in a significant limit in model performance when faced with data from different domains, limiting the generalization of few-shot models. To solve this problem, this study proposes a new setting, namely, domain-generalized few-shot text classification. First, meta-training is conducted on a multi-domain dataset to learn a generalizable model. Subsequently, the model is meta-tested on a target dataset. In addition, a domain-generalized model, namely, a dual adversarial network, is designed to improve the meta-learning-based methods under domain drift between different datasets and domains. Unlike previous meta-learning methods, two N-way-K-shot tasks were input from different domains for a dual adversarial network at each episode. Dual adversarial networks leverage the features from two different domains for adversarial training to improve the domain adaptability of the model. The proposed model utilizes a domain-knowledge generator during adversarial training to produce domain-specific knowledge, and a domain discriminator to recognize the domain label of the produced knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed settings and model. The experimental results show that the model performance in our proposed setting is improved by an average of 3.84% compared to that in cross-domain few-shot text classification. Furthermore, the dual adversarial network significantly outperforms the five competitive baseline models, with an average improvement of 7.20%. The proposed model achieves an average performance improvement of 2.69% compared with the best baseline method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGY
AB Workflow scheduling in cloud platforms is a highly challenging issue because it faces multiple conflicting optimization objectives and large-scale decision variables. Most of the existing multiobjective workflow scheduling algorithms regard the focused problems as black boxes, and optimize large-scale decision variables as a whole. This leads to inefficiency in searching solution spaces that grow exponentially with the increase of decision variables. To compensate the above deficiency, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven adaptive evolutionary multi-objective scheduling algorithm, KAMSA for short, to optimize makespan and cost of workflow execution in cloud platforms. Specifically, we excavate the knowledge that adjustment of a task's execution only affects its successor tasks to divide large-scale decision variables into a series of groups, so as to give play to the strengths of divide-and-conquer technology to improve the evolutionary search efficiency. Moreover, we develop an adaptive resource allocation scheme to reward more evolution opportunities for groups with high contributions to further improve the evolutionary search efficiency. We compare the proposed KAMSA with five state-of-the-art competitors in the context of 20 real-world workflows and the Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2). The comparison results verify the KAMSA's advantages by prevailing over the five competitors on 18 out of the 20 test cases with respect to the metric hypervolume.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Resistance to the adoption of autonomous systems comes in part from the perceived unreliability of the systems. The concerns can be addressed by deploying decision making algorithms that defines what it means to fail, and look for plans with the highest reward while limiting the probability of failure. This chance-constrained approach thus explicitly imposes a set of constraints that must be satisfied for success, and provides upper-bounds on the probability of violating such constraints. A chance-constrained mixed logical-linear program (CC-MLLP) is a natural formulation, allowing for the specification of linear and logical constraints, with probabilistic continuous variables. The formalism can be used to describe problems ranging from autonomous underwater vehicle path planning, to network routing under uncertainty. While naive encodings of CC-MLLPs can be solved with generalised solvers, the solution time may be unreasonable. In this work, we study architectures to speed up solutions by partitioning CC-MLLPs into the discrete and continuous portions. In order to provide faster solutions, we investigate methods for speeding up the solutions to the continuous chance constrained linear programs. Further, by exploiting the new solution methods, we develop techniques for guiding the discrete decision making portion of the problem. The resulting algorithm achieves 10 times speed up over prior approaches on autonomous path planning benchmarks.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm wherein an artificial agent interacts with an environment with the purpose of learning behaviour that maximizes the expected cumulative reward it receives from the environment. Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured, automata-based representation of a reward function that enables an RL agent to decompose an RL problem into structured subproblems that can be efficiently learned via off-policy learning. Here we show that RMs can be learned from experience, instead of being specified by the user, and that the resulting problem decomposition can be used to effectively solve partially observable RL problems. We pose the task of learning RMs as a discrete optimization problem where the objective is to find an RM that decomposes the problem into a set of subproblems such that the combination of their optimal memoryless policies is an optimal policy for the original problem. We show the effectiveness of this approach on three partially observable domains, where it significantly outperforms A3C, PPO, and ACER, and discuss its advantages, limitations, and broader potential.1 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE RGB-D salient object detection; Cross-modality feature; Bidirectional

AB Aiming at the issues of insufficient cross-modality feature interaction and ineffective utilization of cross-modality data in RGB-D saliency object detection (SOD) tasks, we propose a Bidirectional Attentional Interaction Network (BAINet) for RGB-D SOD, which employs an encoder-decoder structure for bidirectional interaction of cross-modality features through a dual-branch progressive fusion approach. To begin with, based on the fact that RGB and depth information streams can complement each other, the bidirectional attention interaction module accomplishes bidirectional interaction between cross-modality features by capturing complementary cues from different modality data. In order to enhance the expressiveness of the fused RGB-D features, the global feature perception module endows the features with rich multi-scale contextual semantic information by enlarging the field of perception. In addition, exploring the correlation of cross-level features is vital to achieve accurate salient inference. Specifically, We introduce a cross-level guidance aggregation module to capture inter-layer de-pendencies and complete the integration of cross-level features, which effectively suppresses shallow cross-modality features and refines the saliency map during decoding. To improve the model training speed, a hybrid loss function is employed to train multi-branch saliency inference maps simultaneously. Extensive ex-periments on five publicly available datasets clearly show that the proposed model outperforms 18 state-of-the -art methods.

AB This paper considers the problem of finding optimal strategies in Stackelberg Security Games when playing against a non-perfectly rational Attacker. To this end, a novel Duel-based NeuroEvolutionary approach to Security Games (DNESG) is proposed, which utilizes the Strategy Comparison Neural Network (SCNN) as a surrogate model to compare pairs of Defender's strategies. SCNN is trained on historical data (past attack attempts) and does not require any direct information about the Attacker's preferences regarding targets, payoff distribution, or decision-making model. SCNN is embedded in the Evolutionary Algorithm framework and implements a tournament-based selection method in place of a time-consuming direct strategy evaluation. The effectiveness of DNESG is assessed on a set of 90 benchmark Deep Packet Inspection games inspired by real cybersecurity scenarios. The proposed method provides high-quality solutions and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (both exact and approximate) with statistical significance when playing against non-perfectly rational Attacker. Moreover, DNESG offers excellent time scalability, being two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Linear Programming method. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Stock indexes are of vital importance to understand financial and economic markets of sectors and nations. Given the importance of market indexes, researchers, investors, and policy makers are continuously working to improve models to forecast market movements; small improvements in modeling have the potential for large financial gains. To this end, machine learning approaches have gained in popularity as both software and hardware performance have increased. In this work, we apply machine learning applications to the S & P 500, DAX, AEX and the SMI indexes to improve forecasting performance. In particular, we take advantage of the fractal and Self-Similarity behaviors that exist in the time series of these indexes using simple Recurrent Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, and Long-Short Term Memory architectures. We apply the architecture using 60-, 30-, and 15-min windows of daily series for each approach and index. The results indicate that for the S & P 500 the proposed self-similarity models outperform all base approaches. However, results are not uniform across all models and indexes. Overall, performance differences across models and indexes are presented. To check the difference between the forecasts of the self-similarity and base models, Model Confidence Set was used.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of high mortality rates among women. An early disease diagnosis is crucial in breast cancer's treatment for improving the survival rate of people who have been afflicted. Human error, incorrect diagnoses, and insufficient time make manual techniques for breast cancer diagnosis ineffective and inefficient. An automated breast cancer diagnosis system assists the medical expert in diagnosing the cancer at its earliest stage. When attempting to investigate all aspects (high dimensionality) of the medical records, the automated diagnosis system faces significant challenges. It reduces the success rate of the diagnosis system. This study presents a two-stage feature subset selection approach using quasi-opposition self-adaptive coati optimization algorithm for breast cancer classification. The proposed scheme's fitness function aims to maximize the success rate and minimize the feature selection ratio. We used the three benchmark datasets (Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset (WDBC), Breast Cancer Wisconsin Prognostic Dataset (WPBC), and Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original Dataset (WBCD)) to examine the proposed scheme's performance. The comparison analysis results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other competitor schemes. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A representational limitation of current argumentation frameworks is their inability to deal with sets of entities and their properties, for example to express that an argument is applicable for a specific set of entities that have a certain property and not applicable for all the others. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced Abstract Argumentation Frameworks with Domain Assignments (AAFDs), which extend Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AAFs) by assigning to each argument a domain of application, i.e., a set of entities for which the argument is believed to apply. We provided formal definitions of AAFDs and their semantics, showed with examples how this model can support various features of commonsense and non-monotonic reasoning, and studied its relation to AAFs. In this paper, aiming to provide a deeper insight into this new model, we present more results on the relation between AAFDs and AAFs and the properties of the AAFD semantics, and we introduce an alternative, more expressive way to define the domains of arguments using logical predicates. We also offer an implementation of AAFDs based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) and evaluate it using a range of experiments with synthetic datasets.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Data uncertainty is frequent in CER applications and results in erroneous detection. To support streaming applications, we present oPIECbd, an extension of oPIEC with a bounded memory, leveraging interval duration statistics to resolve memory conflicts. oPIECbd may achieve comparable predictive accuracy to batch reasoning, avoiding the prohibitive cost of such reasoning. Furthermore, the use of interval duration statistics allows oPIECbd to outperform significantly earlier versions of bounded oPIEC. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of oPIECbd on a benchmark activity recognition dataset, as well as real data streams from the field of maritime situational awareness. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB A major responsibility of radiologists in routine clinical practice is to read follow-up chest radiographs (CXRs) to identify changes in a patient's condition. Diagnosing meaningful changes in follow-up CXRs is challenging because radiologists must differentiate disease changes from natural or benign variations. Here, we suggest using a multi-task Siamese convolutional vision transformer (MuSiC-ViT) with an anatomy-matching module (AMM) to mimic the radiologist's cognitive process for differentiating baseline change from no-change. MuSiC-ViT uses the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) meet vision transformers model that combines CNN and transformer architecture. It has three major components: a Siamese network architecture, an AMM, and multi-task learning. Because the input is a pair of CXRs, a Siamese network was adopted for the encoder. The AMM is an attention module that focuses on related regions in the CXR pairs. To mimic a radiologist's cognitive process, MuSiC-ViT was trained using multi-task learning, normal/abnormal and change/no-change classification, and anatomymatching. Among 406 K CXRs studied, 88 K change and 115 K no-change pairs were acquired for the training dataset. The internal validation dataset consisted of 1,620 pairs. To demonstrate the robustness of MuSiC-ViT, we verified the results with two other validation datasets. MuSiC-ViT respectively achieved accuracies and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.728 and 0.797 on the internal validation dataset, 0.614 and 0.784 on the first external validation dataset, and 0.745 and 0.858 on a second temporally separated validation dataset.

   digital twin; Digital verification
AB Digital twin (DT) is a technology that creates a digital replica of its physical entity with full information including historical and real-time data. They are expected to become an essential tool in industry 4.0 due to their ability to collect massive amounts of real-world data which can be utilized by artificial inelegance technologies for various purposes. The application of DT concepts in product design field has drawn wide interest, and DT has recently been proposed as a tool for supporting early-stage product design. Based on the difference in physical entities, DTs are classified as similar-product DT and mock-up prototype DT in this paper. Since there is often no product or physical prototype in early design stages, these two types of DTs for product design are primarily for re-design cases where data is collected from the DT of the similar products or prototypes. Introducing DTs to a new product design scenario is rarely explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes the third type of DT, Supersystem DT that collects data from a product's supersystem (i.e., the working/operation environment). A systematic framework that integrates the Supersystem DT and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (i.e., TRIZ) tools are presented for early design activities including task clarification and conceptual design. A case study of designing a new camper box of an expedition vehicle is presented to show the process and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, guidelines for selecting the three types of DTs in different design scenarios are discussed.

TI ABC-Fusion: Adapter-based BERT-level confusion set fusion approach for
   Chinese spelling correction
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE Chinese spelling correction; BERT adapter; Knowledge fusion
AB Chinese spelling correction (CSC) aims to automatically detect and correct spelling errors in Chinese sentences. Recently, the method that combines a pre-trained language model with external knowledge has achieved excellent performance. The knowledge is either derived from multi-modal information such as pronunciations and glyphs, or from a confusion set that collects confusing character pairs. However, existing advanced multi-modal knowledge based methods have superior performance at the cost of largely increased model size; and although context semantics is essential for CSC, current confusion set based methods fail to use the confusion set to model the semantics as they do not fuse the lexical feature. To deal with these issues, we propose an Adapter-based BERT-level Confusion Set Fusion method which fuses BERT with the semantics of confusing characters in the semantic encoding phase. A lightweight adapter is designed to be placed between BERT layers, which dynamically extracts the relevant knowledge among the confusing candidates and integrates it with the context. In this way, the contextual information and the semantics of the candidates can fully interact within BERT. Experiments1 are conducted on three benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous confusion set based methods and shows comparable performance with the multi-modal knowledge based methods.

TI Improving sparse graph attention for feature matching by informative

SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Feature matching; Graph neural network; Outlier; Two-view geometry
AB Feature matching refers to building correct point correspondences from two-view images. Typical methods create coarse matches merely based on the similarity of local descriptors, then additionally use geometrical constraints or coherence to get a clean match set. However, this indirect paradigm would be strictly limited by the pre-matching results. This can be alleviated by a GNN-based matching network that constructs correct correspondences directly from feature positions and descriptions. Attentional pooling is utilized to reduce the high computational complexity and memory usage by sparsing the graph attention. In this paper, we propose an enhanced sparse GNN, namely KeyGNN, for fast feature matching, by designing Guided Attentional Pooling to emphasize the informative cues in GNN layers. Specifically, we propose Informative Keypoints Exploration Module and Guided Sparse Module to respectively extract information-rich points and use them to guide the attentional pooling for better information preservation. This process is constrained by the proposed Structural Importance Ranking Loss and Descriptor Distribution Loss, that ensure the structural information can be correctly extracted and the generated feature vectors be well distributed in the deep space. Unlike existing techniques, our method can focus and preserve more on the main information in the sparse GNN stage, thus avoiding information loss and enhancing the accuracy. Extensive experiments on large and public datasets reveal that our method can obtain better performance than the state-of-the-arts in the tasks of camera pose estimation, fundamental matrix estimation, and visual localization. The runtime and memory test shows that our network takes low computational and memory usage, which is friendly to real-time vision tasks.

DE Linguistic vagueness; Computing with Approximate reasoning
ID FUZZY PROLOG; LANGUAGE; LOGIC; SEMANTICS; CONSENSUS
AB The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for the automatic treatment of linguistic vagueness. Our motivation is the feeling that most existing approaches dealing with linguistic information are based on converting vague meaning into crisp meaning using some conversions to precise measurements. As a result, existing approaches are adequate and easy to implement, but do not closely model the human thought process. To help alleviate this deficiency, we propose the use of linguistic relations to provide a natural language interface to an end user. We show a possible linguistic Prolog model based on an extension of the syntactic unification algorithm using synonymy and antonymy, as well as the extension of the resolution principle. Our approach does not aim to provide a well-founded formal semantics for such a linguistic Prolog, but a simple model supported by two experiments focused on the use of vague language, both of them executed in Spanish (an analysis of the data of the first experiment it is also available in that language at [1]). Thus, the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the mechanization of approximate reasoning by being respectful of the semantics of the vague terms involved in it; i.e., by paying attention to how they are evaluated by linguistic users under experimentation. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB In 2018, Jirousek and Shenoy proposed a definition of entropy for Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief functions called decomposable entropy (d-entropy). This paper provides an algorithm for computing the d-entropy of directed graphical D-S belief function models. We illustrate the algorithm using Almond's Captain's Problem example. For belief function undirected graphical models, assuming that the set of belief functions in the model is non-informative, the belief functions are distinct. We illustrate this using Haenni-Lehmann's Communication Network problem. As the joint belief function for this model is quasi-consonant, it follows from a property of d-entropy that the d-entropy of this model is zero, and no algorithm is required. For a class of undirected graphical models, we provide an algorithm for computing the d-entropy of such models. Finally, the d-entropy coincides with Shannon's entropy for the probability mass function of a single random variable and for a large multi-dimensional probability distribution expressed as a directed acyclic graph model called a Bayesian network. We illustrate this using Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter's Chest Clinic example represented as a belief-function directed graphical model.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A Pawlak approximation space is a pair of a ground set/space and a quotient set/space, where the latter is induced by an equivalence relation on the former. With this two-space understanding, it is possible to lift any concepts and notions from the ground space to the quotient space. The results are granular versions that approximate the original concepts and notions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of lifting a fuzzy set in the ground space to granular fuzzy sets in the quotient space. By applying the principles of threeway decision, we introduce the idea of three-way granular approximations of fuzzy sets in terms of three granular fuzzy sets that represent the two extremes and one middle. The two extremes are given by granular rough fuzzy sets. We present several different ways to interpret and construct a middle.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In order to prevent the abnormal appearance of gravel aggregate material level in the mixing plant, improve the safety of the concrete mixing plant system as well as the efficient and high-quality production of the concrete mixing plant, this paper proposes a monocular vision-based fast and intelligent measurement method for the volume of concrete aggregate. This method combines peak and valley positioning information derived from target detection model to find the height of aggregate level and diameter of the surface circle formed by the valley. The relationship between this localization data and the height, angle and volume data are then analyzed separately, and finally, the volume of the aggregate is calculated. The experimental results show that the average accuracy in the peak state of the fast and intelligent measurement method of concrete aggregate volume based on monocular vision is 93.06%, the average accuracy of the volume in the valley state is 92.20%, and the real-time monitoring speed can reach between 111 and 115f/s. The effects can meet the real-time measurement of aggregate volume in the high-level storage bin.

DE Transmission lines; Defect detection; Lightweight; UAV
AB Accurate identification of defective components in transmission lines and timely feedback to inspectors for timely maintenance can ensure the stable operation of the power system. A defect detection system based on "edge-cloud-end" collaboration is introduced to solve the problems of high bandwidth consumption and response delay in the cloud server-based approach. The system transfers the operation of image detection to the edge device, which reduces the data transmission and improves the response speed of the system. To balance the detection speed and accuracy of the algorithm, the YOLO-inspection algorithm applied on edge devices is proposed. The algorithm uses GhostNetV2 to reconstruct the C3 module in the YOLOv5 model, which reduces the computational complexity and captures the correlation between distant pixels so that it is more targeted to the critical region of the defective target. Meanwhile, based on the feature fusion network, a dynamic adaptive weight assignment module and cross-scale connectivity are designed to effectively reduce information loss and help the network learn fine-grained features. The improved algorithm is deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform, and the model is optimally accelerated using TensorRT. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can accurately identify defective samples, and the YOLO-inspection algorithm has superior generalization ability under the harsh conditions of low light and snowfall weather conditions. On the edge computing platform, the mean average precision (mAP) can reach 94.3%, and the inference speed can reach 63 frames per second (FPS). It can be proved that the method has good detection performance.

TI TS-DSANN: Texture and shape focused dual-stream attention neural network

AB Recently, accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules has played a critical role in precision medicine and healthcare system management. Due to complicated changes in ultrasound features of texture, and similar visual appearance of benign-malignant nodules, the identification of cancerous thyroid lesions from a given ultrasound image still faces challenges for even experienced radiologists. Learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have accordingly attracted more and more attention recently. However, little research is committed to developing a deep learning-based CAD system that has greater conformity with radiologists' diagnostic decision-making. In this study, we devise a texture and shape focused dual-stream attention neural network, dubbed TS-DSANN. Specifically, in the texture focused stream, we utilize the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 to guide the network to recognize texture-related nodule attributes. Meanwhile, in the shape focused stream, in addition to using ResNet34 backbone, jointly learning from scratch with the contour obtained by contour detection module to enhance the extraction of shape features. Afterward, we employ a concatenation operation to aggregate the abovementioned two stream networks for capturing richer and more representative features. Finally, we further utilize an online class activation mapping mechanism to assist the dual-stream network in generating a localization heatmap to obtain more visualization attention to the nodule from the whole image, and supervise classifier's attention in decision-making. Experimental results conducted on the two-center thyroid nodule ultrasound datasets verify that our proposed method has improved the classification performance, superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Multi-view imbalanced learning concentrates on recognizing valuable patterns from multi-view imbalanced data. There are numerous algorithm-level multi-view imbalanced learning methods including multi-view ensemble learning methods and multi-view cost-sensitive learning methods. However, these approaches have two draw-backs. Firstly, from the multi-view representation perspective, they either ignore the agreement among different views, or fail to fully exploit the complementarity information contained in multi-view data. Secondly, from the class-imbalanced perspective, multi-view ensemble learning first needs to design a specific data pre-processing scheme to generate views and then fuses the local and global information with multi-view ensemble schemes. Such models are closely related to practical problems and lack universality. In contrast, multi-view cost-sensitive learning methods possess concise formulations. But the success of such methods depends on imposing appro-priate misclassification cost to the majority and minority classes. Inspired by elegant merits of asymmetric LINEX loss function, we propose a multi-view cost-sensitive kernel learning method with LINEX loss termed as MVCSKL. It not only fully exploits the consensus and complementary information of multiple views, but also adaptively learns and adjusts the misclassification cost of different classes through the asymmetric LINEX loss function. Besides, the introduction of the kernel function enables the MVCSKL model to handle complex nonlinear problem and further guarantees its prediction performance. Furthermore, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers and gradient descent algorithm to solve MVCSKL. Based on the Rademacher complexity, we analyze the generalization capability of MVCSKL. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

DE Self-supervised learning; Deep metric learning; Bregman divergences;

AB Neural Bregman divergence measures the divergence of data points using convex neural networks, which is beyond Euclidean distance and capable of capturing divergence over distributions. The non-Euclidean geometry is not well explored in deep representation learning and remains a challenging endeavor for self -supervised representation learning. In this paper, we propose deep Bregman divergences for self-supervised pretext task learning, where we aim to enhance self-supervised embedding representation by training additional networks based on functional Bregman divergences. Our framework can capture the divergence of embedding distributions and improve the quality of learned representation using an arbitrary Bregman divergence over data embedding. Specifically, we develop a novel self-supervised architecture and a new divergence loss that measures the asymmetric distance of arbitrary Bergman divergences of neural networks. We show that the combination of self-supervised contrastive learning and our proposed method outperforms the baseline as well as most established methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on multiple classifications and object detection tasks and datasets. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well when transferred to other datasets and tasks.

AB Lower resolution and fewer feature details appear in small objects, so achieving small object detection is a challenging task. To improve the detection ability in the case of low-resolution object details, we propose to exploit 3D features with FCOS for representing small objects. The proposed method employs a Global Spatial Block (GS-Block) in the backbone to guide the network to learn the picture's shallow features and increase the model's perceived capability for small objects. In addition, we introduce a 3D sparse convolution in the shallow input features of the detection heads to better capture the global and contextual information of the shallow feature elements and further improve the feature representation of small objects in the backgrounds, and the whole network is referred to as 3DF-FCOS. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of 3DF-FCOS on VisDrone2019Det. The results show that our method achieves a remarkable improvement in AP and APs compared to the baselines of 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively. Compared with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, the performance of our proposed 3DF-FCOS is comparable.

AB A new class of prior distributions that can be used to assess the sensitivity of the Bayesian posterior inference to uncertainty in the data is proposed. This class is derived starting from an initial prior distribution and the likelihood function. We establish the mathematical properties of this class and the conditions under which ordering can be established within this class. We show how the sensitivity analysis can be performed using a standard MCMC procedure for any model whose likelihood, or an approximation, is available in a closed form and illustrate using examples. We also discuss how the proposed class is connected to the main ideas behind the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method. For this reason, we choose to call the new class of prior distributions as the ABC class of prior distributions.

AB Deep neural networks have shown their profound impact on achieving human-level performance in visual saliency prediction. However, it is still unclear how they learn their task and what it means in terms of understanding human visual system. In this work, we propose a framework to derive explainable saliency models from their corresponding deep architectures. Mainly, we explain a deep saliency model by under-standing its four different aspects: (1) intermediate activation maps of deep layers, (2) biologically plausible Log-Gabor (LG) filters for salient region identification, (3) positional biased behavior of Log-Gabor filters and (4) processing of color information by establishing a relevance with human visual system. We consider four state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep saliency models, namely CMRNet, UNISAL, DeepGaze IIE, and MSI-Net for their interpretation using our proposed framework. We observe that explainable models perform way better than the classical SOTA models. We also find that CMRNet transforms the input RGB space to a representation after the input layer, which is very close to YUV space of a color image. Then, we discuss about the biological consideration and relevance of our framework for its possible anatomical substratum of visual attention. We find a good correlation between components of HVS and the base operations of the proposed technique. Hence, we say that this generic explainable framework provides a new perspective to see relationship between classical methods/human visual system and DNN based ones.

AB For real-time single-image dehazing, this paper suggests a straightforward and efficient saturation-based transmission map estimation method. For the suggested image dehazing algorithm, the design of a hardware-efficient very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture is also provided. By removing the computationally demanding sorting operations, the algorithm computes the dark channel, increases the robustness of atmospheric light estimation using a hardware-friendly local atmospheric light estimation module based on the pixel saturation values, and reduces the effects of halo artifacts using an edge-preserving filter to estimate the saturation-based transmission map. Compared to previous sophisticated dehazing approaches, this study exhibits competitive performance in the quality of the dehazed images. The best of the existing dehazing architecture as well as the proposed architecture are described in Verilog hardware description language (HDL), functionally verified using Vivado 2019.1 simulator, and synthesized using Cadence genus compiler. The results of the implementation show that the suggested design is hardware-efficient and offers higher throughput. The suggested dehazing architecture achieves better results in terms of area and delay than the most recent methods and is appropriate for applications with hardware restrictions.

AB This paper proposes a real-time face recognition application to aid people living with Alzheimer's in identifying the people around them. This is achieved by developing a portable system consisting of glasses with an ESP32-CAM and a single-board microcomputer (the Raspberry Pi). The proposed system operates automatically and does not require physical interaction with the user. It utilizes wireless technologies to capture real-time video frames of human faces and transmit them (via Wi-Fi) to the Raspberry Pi, which detects and recognizes the captured human face and sends voice-activated feedback to the user's ears over Bluetooth to pronounce their name. Several incompatibility challenges are encountered and appropriately handled during the system's development, integration, and testing processes. A fully functional prototype is developed and tested successfully. When compared to the state-of-the-art, the obtained results have demonstrated superior performance in terms of a training accuracy of 99.46% and a face recognition accuracy of 99.48%. The entire processing time from capturing the human face to generating the voice message is found to be about one second (730 ms on a laptop and 1109 ms on a Raspberry Pi). The developed technology is anticipated to improve the patient's quality of life and reduce their dependence on others.

TI MSSD: multi-scale object detector based on spatial pyramid depthwise

AB Object detection has made widespread development and remarkable progress in various fields, but, in complex application scenarios, often encounters the situation that the target features are inconspicuous and the scale range is large, making it incapable of achieving the desirable results, especially for small targets. This paper proposes a multi-scale object detector MSSD based on spatial pyramid depthwise convolution (SPDC) and efficient channel attention mechanism (ECAM) from the optimization of SSD. Firstly, use ResNet50 to replace VGG as backbone to obtain more representative features. Secondly, a plug-and-play spatial pyramid depthwise convolution module SPDC is proposed to enhance perceptual field and multi-scale feature extraction capabilities. Furthermore, we design a straightforward efficient channel attention mechanism (ECAM) to scale the weights of features on channels to derive more robust features. Finally, the feature pyramid network (FPN) with ECAM (ECAM-FPN) module is introduced in the prediction feature layer for deep feature fusion to obtain multi-scale features rich in semantic and detail information. For 300x300 input, MSSD achieves 82.5% mAP on PASCAL VOC07+12 dataset at 56 FPS and 48.2% mAP on MS COCO2017 dataset, which are 8.2% and 7.0% higher than SSD(300), respectively. Detection of small targets is improved by 0.8% on COCO and by 6.5% when scaled to 512x512. The proposed method has significant gains in cross-scale target detection while satisfying real time and is comparable with other methods.

DE Economic system forecasting; Temporal fusion transformers; Gross final
   product; Multi-dimensional evaluation; Cross -model comparative analysis
AB Although helpful in reducing the uncertainty associated with economic activities, economic forecasting often suffers from low accuracy. Recognizing the high compatibility between deep learning and the non-linear characteristics of socioeconomic systems, in this paper, we introduce state-of-the-art temporal fusion transformers (TFTs) into the field of economic system forecasting and predict the performance of the Chinese macroeconomic system. Based on an extended analysis of gross final product (GFP) and the intertemporal dynamic relationship between demand-side indicators and output indicators, we establish a scientific economic forecasting framework. To summarize the forecasting characteristics of the TFT algorithm, we compare its one-step and three-step modeling effects in forecasting output indi-cators with a series of representative benchmark models. According to our proposed four-dimensional evaluation system, the forecasts for China's macroeconomic system provided by the TFT model have obvi-ous advantages in terms of overall stability, forecasting efficiency, reduction of numerical and timing errors, direction accuracy, and turning point accuracy. The forecast results show that China's economy faces a risk of slowing growth in the post-pandemic period.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Task-aware network: Mitigation of task-aware and task-free performance
   gap in online continual learning
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Online Continual Learning; Online Incremental Learning
AB Online continual learning (OCL) is a challenging task that accesses training data only once and trains a deep model to cover a new task while preserving the capability of previous tasks. Due to the poor performance, early works tend to measure the performance in a task-aware (TA) manner, which assumes task labels in the testing time. However, requiring such an assumption is far from the real world. Although recent works also measure the performance without the assumption (i.e., a task-free (TF) manner), there is still a large performance gap between TA and TF in the online environment. In this paper, we observe that the severe performance gap is due to the overlapped information between different tasks. Inspired by this observation, we propose the Task-Aware Network (TANet), which learns both class-specific and task-specific information using a dual-encoder framework. However, it is difficult to learn the global distribution of previous tasks since only a few samples (i.e., exemplars) of the tasks can be accessed. To solve the problem, we utilize the prototype feature that reflects the global distribution of each task. Using the prototype features, TANet learns the task-specific information with Prototype-based Task Contrastive Learning (PTCL) and generates pseudo-task labels. In testing time, we introduce the hybrid task-free (TF) classifier, which only activates the task that the pseudo label indicates. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances in various datasets for OCL.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This publication presents the Complexity Drift Detector (C2D) - the method for detecting a concept shift in the data stream based on the classification task complexity measures. The method belongs to the group of detectors agnostic to the recognition quality of the base classifier. The possibility of selecting a set of dif-ficulty measures taken into account during the data stream processing allows applying the method to many tasks in which the detection of a classification task complexity change is expected. The publication includes experiments analyzing the hyperparameters' influence on the operation of the method and a broad comparative experiment comparing the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art solutions. The experiments were carried out on synthetic data streams of different dimensions and with different con-cept drift characteristics, also presenting the effects of processing real-world data streams. The results of the conducted research confirm the high efficiency of the method in detecting concept changes, sensitive not only to the fact of drift occurrence but also to its dynamics.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB In recent years, the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) scientific community has invested continuous efforts to employ artificial intelligence methods to design and develop new energy systems. It is crucial to gain a better understanding of the microscale phenomena that occur in the electrodes. In this review, we present a literature review of the field, discussing the limitations of including microstructural data in existing research and possible research directions to overcome them. This review focuses on a particular research area that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the performance of SOFCs. Herein, we show that neural networks are used not only to conform to the newest trends but also for improving the design and providing a better understanding of microscale phenomena that occur in the electrodes. The review concludes by highlighting topological data analysis as a promising area of research that can incorporate detailed microstructure characterization in ANNs for performance prediction.

AB Efforts towards achieving high access to cooking with clean energy have not been transformative due to a limited understanding of the clean-energy drivers and a lack of evidence-based clean-energy policy recommendations. This study addresses this gap by building a high-performing machine learning model to predict and understand the mechanisms driving energy poverty - specifically access to cooking with clean energy. In a first-of-a-kind, the estimated cost of US$14.5 trillion to enable universal access to cooking with clean energy encompasses all the intermediate inputs required to build self-sufficient ecosystems by creating value-addition sectors. Unlike previous studies, the data-driven clean-cooking transition pathways provide foundations for shaping policy and building energy models that can transform the complex energy and cooking landscape. Developing these pathways is necessary to increase people's financial resilience to tackle energy poverty. The findings also show the absence of a linear relationship between electricity access and clean cooking - evidencing the need for a rapid paradigm shift to address energy poverty. A new fundamental approach that focuses on improving and sustaining the financial capacity of households through a systems approach is required so that they can afford electricity or fuels for cooking.

AB Machine learning (ML) supports energy-efficient design by quickly predicting the building performance at early stages. However, existing ML approaches cannot easily learn geometrical representations and their interactions with technical specifications for predicting energy. Common approaches of artificial neural networks (ANN) use either numerical parameters to represent building geometry or component-based ML (CBML) to train transferrable ML components. However, both approaches have high generalisation errors for complex geometries. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn geometrical representations of buildings and an autoencoder to optimise the training process. We test existing approaches of ANN and CBML with a proposed approach of CNN for different sizes of training datasets. For the biggest training dataset, ANN, CBML, and CNN have generalisation errors (root-mean-squared errors) of 1.35, 1.60, and 0.77 kWh/a.m2, respectively. While CBML has lower prediction errors on small datasets, CNN is more suitable for large datasets. Also, CNN most often has better prediction accuracy than ANN and trains faster on encoded data. Since CNN captures the effects of building geometry on energy predictions better than ANN and CBML approaches, it is an attractive choice for early-stage energy design.

AB The aim of this study is to improve ride comfort among tractor drivers by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict vibration exposure. The study explores the association between tractor ride characteristics, including average speed, tool depth, and pulling force, and ride comfort during actual rotary soil tillage operations. Ride comfort was evaluated by calculating the Overall Vibration Value (OVV) at three measurement locations (i.e., the floor, seat pan, and seat backrest). The study employed spectral analysis i.e., Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) to determine the predominant resonant frequencies. In addition, ML approaches i.e., Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to predict ride comfort response. Three hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian optimization were used. Tractor-tiller system was operated on a real agricultural field by five male tractor drivers. Vibration levels were measured along three translational axes at three measurement locations using a smart monitoring device based on the IoT concept. Average OVV magnitude was computed as 0.84 m/s2 i.e., exceeding the ISO 2631-1 (1997) threshold limits. FFT and PSD analysis revealed a variety of dominant frequencies, including resonance peaks at 2 Hz, 6-7 Hz, and 9-11 Hz. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that tractor speed and tool depth are significant variables (at the 5% level) in determining ride comfort. Regarding predictive accuracy, the ANN model exhibits the highest coefficient of determination of 0.90, followed by the SVM and GPR models with a coefficient of determination of 0.89. The DTR and LR models demonstrate slightly lower coefficient of determination values of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization proved to be an effective approach in achieving more accurate predictions of tractor ride comfort. In general, the study outcomes can be utilized by tractor designers in numerous ways to optimize tractor design (such as suspension system, cab design, seat design, etc.) to improve tractor ride comfort in real field applications.

DE Multi-robot; Task allocation; Functional task; Hyper-heuristic algorithm
ID DECISION-MAKING; FRAMEWORK
AB Multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem is a classical problem in multi-robot systems. The most common assumption in MRTA is that all the tasks need to be completed with the time cost as small as possible. It is worth noting that some tasks may be optional in some real-world situations, i.e., the robots do not necessarily need to complete all tasks. These optional tasks do not limit the achievement of the goal, but the completion of these tasks will lead to some functional effects (e.g., making other tasks easier to be completed). Therefore, these optional tasks can be called "functional task". Different from functional tasks, if a task must be completed, this task can be called "compulsory task". In this paper, we study the problem where the robots need to minimize the time cost of completing all compulsory tasks and can selectively complete some functional tasks. The existence of the functional tasks greatly increases the solution space of MRTA, because the functional tasks should be firstly suitably selected and then suitably allocated. Existing related algorithms are usually based on the assumption that all tasks must be allocated. Thus, these algorithms cannot suitably deal with functional tasks. We analyze the characteristics of this problem and present a new hyper-heuristic algorithm. The low-level heuristic (LLH) in hyper-heuristic is designed to score the functional tasks by using influence diffusion model. The high-level strategy (HLS) seeks the optimal values of the key parameters in the influence diffusion model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Extensive simulated experiments are presented to comprehensively analyze the proposed algorithm. The proposed hyper-heuristic is compared with greedy algorithm and two meta-heuristic algorithms. Based on the simulated data, it is known that the hyper-heuristic algorithm can outperform the benchmark algorithms especially when the number of functional tasks is large.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Automatic speech-based severity level classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) enables objective assessment and earlier diagnosis. While many studies have been conducted on the binary classification task to distinguish speakers in PD from healthy controls (HCs), clearly fewer studies have addressed multi-class PD severity level classification problems. Furthermore, in studying the three main issues of speech-based classification systems - speaking tasks, features, and classifiers - previous investigations on the severity level classification have yielded inconclusive results due to the use of only a few, and sometimes just one, type of speaking task, feature, or classifier in each study. Hence, a systematic comparison is conducted in this study between different speaking tasks, features, and classifiers. Five speaking tasks (vowel task, sentence task, diadochokinetic (DDK) task, read text task, and monologue task), four features (phonation, articulation, prosody, and their fusion), and four classifier architectures (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and AdaBoost) were compared. The classification task studied was a 3-class problem to classify PD severity level as healthy us. mild us. severe. Two MDS-UPDRS scales (MDS-UPDRS-III and MDS-UPDRS-S) were used for the ground truth severity level labels. The results showed that the use of the monologue task and the articulation and fusion of features improved classification accuracy significantly compared to the use of the other speaking tasks and features. The best classification systems resulted in a rate of accuracy of 58% (using the monologue task with the articulation features) for the MDS-UPDR-III scale and 56% (using the monologue task with fusion of features) for the MDS-UPDRS-S scale.

DT Article
DE Remaining useful life; Physics -informed learning; Epistemic
   uncertainty; Maximum likelihood
AB This study proposes a methodology for developing deterioration models to estimate the remaining lifetime of a system using physics-informed learning. The approach consists of combining physical knowledge about the system with a set of data obtained from similar systems that have failed in the past to build a set of constraints on the evolution over time of the state of health of the system. The data consists of partial measurements of the system variables, taken from its commissioning to the present. The physical knowledge used comprises a set of differential equations that approximate the dynamics and aging of the system. In contrast to other studies, the physical model is not assumed to be accurate, but is considered to be an approximation of reality. Constraints on the temporal evolution of the state of health derived from this physical knowledge take into account its imprecision and consist of possibility distributions. In this study, the max-max, max-min and min-max regret principles are applied to extract the time evolution of the deterioration rate that best fits the constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by means of a comparative empirical analysis in different use cases, and the situations in which informed learning improves on purely data-driven algorithms are analyzed. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Learning an effective and compact representation of human brain function from high-dimensional fMRI data is crucial for studying the brain's functional organization. Traditional representation methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (SDL) mainly rely on matrix decomposition which represents the brain function as spatial brain networks and the corresponding temporal patterns. The correspondence of those brain networks across individuals are built by viewing them as one-hot vectors and then performing the matching. However, those one-hot vectors do not encode the regularity and/or variability of different brains very well, and thus are limited in effectively representing the functional brain activities across individuals and among different time points. To address this problem, in this paper, we formulate the human brain functional representation as an embedding problem, and propose a novel embedding framework based on the Transformer model to encode the brain function in a compact, stereotyped and comparable latent space where the brain activities are represented as dense embedding vectors. We evaluate the proposed embedding framework on the publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI dataset. The experiments on brain state prediction task indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the learned embedding. We also explore the interpretability of the learned embedding from both spatial and temporal perspective. In general, our approach provides novel insights on representing the regularity and variability of human brain function in a general, comparable, and stereotyped latent space.

DE Neural architecture search; Hybrid evolutionary strategy; Performance

AB Using weight-sharing and continuous relaxation strategies, the gradient descent-based differential architecture search has achieved great success in automatically designing neural network architectures. However, unresolved issues, i.e., the local optimum dilemma of the gradient descent method, and the network performance collapse of the searched architecture with too many unreasonable operations, are still frustrating for researchers and practitioners. To address these two issues, a novel and efficient neural architecture search approach based on a hybrid evolutionary strategy, termed EST-NAS, is proposed in this paper. In particular, we propose using a new evolutionary strategy to explore various search directions based on the gradient descent-based neural network architecture search, aiming at obtaining a more excellent architecture. In the proposed EST-NAS, the gradient descent architecture search is performed first, and then the best architecture obtained is utilized to design an efficient initialization for the following evolutionary strategy-based architecture search. By hybridizing evolutionary strategy with gradient descent-based search, EST-NAS can improve the performance of the searched architecture with better search efficiency. Meanwhile, the validation accuracy is applied to directly measure the importance of operations, which reduces the error in the relationship between operation and task performance. Extensive experimental results in the various datasets on different search spaces show that the proposed EST-NAS achieves remarkably competitive performance with less search cost, compared to other state-of-the-art NAS approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the cross-mutation phase of the Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm (ABC algorithm), the value of parameter & phi; is very important to the stability of ABC algorithm, however, most literatures did not specify the origin of the value range of parameter & phi;. Through the theoretical analysis of the stability of the ABC algorithm, appropriate parameters can be selected for the algorithm under different convergence conditions and different application conditions, and then the rapid convergence of the algorithm can be achieved, so the stability analysis of the algorithm is very worth exploring. This paper firstly introduces the ABC algorithm, and then differentiates the motion trajectory equations of employed bees in the ABC algorithm to obtain a differential model; then uses the discrete system stability theory to analyze the stability of the system, and obtains the relationship between the value range of the parameters in the cross-mutation stage and the stability of the algorithm. Finally, the correctness of the conclusion will be verified by experiments using the test function. The results obtained show that ABC algorithm with & phi; & ISIN; (-2, 0) converges faster, and has better global optimization performance than ABC algorithm with other values of & phi;, which are investigated in this paper. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Researchers have been studying genetic algorithms (GAs) extensively in recent decades and employing them to address extremely challenging combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Although GAs achieve superior performance, they are less efficient because most GAs are designed manually without intelligent parameter configuration to support scalable problem-solving strategies and learnable evolutionary operators. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) techniques have been integrated with GAs for operator and parameter selection, however, few studies have focused on intelligent genetic locus selection for influential operators in GAs. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an intelligent genetic locus selection algorithm that serves as the foundation of parameter configuration for critical operators. With the established framework, the Cross Information Synergistic Attention (CISA) model and the n-step proximal policy optimization (PPO) have been utilized to intelligently select the appropriate genetic locus for the most influential phase, i.e., crossover, during the evolutionary process. The proposed NeuroCrossover algorithm is validated on extensive COPs, including the traveling salesman problem, capacitated vehicle routing problem, and bin packing problem. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, which outperforms other methods in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and generalization. For instance, with the CISA, the average percentage gaps of our algorithm are 3.64% and 6.38% for instances in TSPLIB and CVRPLIB, respectively, obtaining gains of about 0.47% and 1.20% compared to those of GA. The proposed algorithm provides a novel solution to lead GAs to an efficient search and improve their scalability and learnability.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prior studies in the automatic classification of voice quality have mainly studied the use of the acoustic speech signal as input. Recently, a few studies have been carried out by jointly using both speech and neck surface accelerometer (NSA) signals as inputs, and by extracting mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and glottal source features. This study examines simultaneously-recorded speech and NSA signals in the classification of voice quality (breathy, modal, and pressed) using features derived from three self-supervised pre-trained models (wav2vec2-BASE, wav2vec2-LARGE, and HuBERT) and using a support vector machine (SVM) as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as classifiers. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the pre-trained models is compared in feature extraction between glottal source waveforms and raw signal waveforms for both speech and NSA inputs. Using two signal processing methods (quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering and zero frequency filtering (ZFF)), glottal source waveforms are estimated from both speech and NSA signals. The study has three main goals: (1) to study whether features derived from pre-trained models improve classification accuracy compared to conventional features (spectrogram, mel-spectrogram, MFCCs, i-vector, and x-vector), (2) to investigate which of the two modalities (speech vs. NSA) is more effective as input in the classification task with pre-trained model-based features, and (3) to evaluate whether the deep learning-based CNN classifier can enhance the classification accuracy in comparison to the SVM classifier. The results revealed that the use of the NSA input showed better classification performance compared to the speech signal. Between the features, the pretrained model-based features showed better classification accuracies, both for speech and NSA inputs compared to the conventional features. The two classifiers performed equally well for all the pre-trained model-based features for both speech and NSA signals. It was also found that the HuBERT features performed better than the wav2vec2-BASE and wav2vec2-LARGE features for both speech and NSA inputs. In particular, when compared to the conventional features, the HuBERT features showed an absolute accuracy improvement of 3%-6% for speech and NSA signals in the classification of voice quality.

AB Obtaining gold standard annotated data for object detection is often costly, involving human-level effort. Semi-supervised object detection algorithms solve the problem with a small amount of gold-standard labels and a large unlabeled dataset used to generate silver-standard labels. But training on the silver standard labels does not produce good results, because they are machine-generated annotations. In this work, we design a modified loss function to train on large silver standard annotated sets generated by a weak annotator. We include a confidence metric associated with the annotation as an additional term in the loss function, signifying the quality of the annotation. We test the effectiveness of our approach on various test sets and use numerous variations to compare the results with some of the current approaches to object detection. In comparison with the baseline where no confidence metric is used, we achieved a 4% gain in mAP with 25% labeled data and 10% gain in mAP with 50% labeled data by using the proposed confidence metric.

AB In the real world, each attribute of data sets has multiple scales, whether it is a conditional attribute or a decision attribute. Knowledge mined from data based on the optimal scale can well meet the needs of real life. Hence, there is no denying that optimal scale selection is an problem to be solved urgently in the knowledge discovery field of multi-scale decision tables. The optimal scale combines coarser condition attributes with the finer decision attribute, so as to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy. With the aim of selecting the optimal scale combination, we firstly explore some related properties and theorems of generalized multi-scale decision tables. Then we define the optimal scale in generalized multi-scale decision tables and propose two algorithms for optimal scale selection. In addition, a knowledge acquisition algorithm and a multi-scale rough set classifier framework are proposed. Finally, numerical experiments are performed on some open data sets to test the effectiveness of the algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the core challenges of deep learning in medical image analysis is data insufficiency, especially for 3D brain imaging, which may lead to model over-fitting and poor generalization. Regularization strategies such as knowledge distillation are powerful tools to mitigate the issue by penalizing predictive distributions and introducing additional knowledge to reinforce the training process. In this paper, we revisit knowledge distillation as a regularization paradigm by penalizing attentive output distributions and intermediate representations. In particular, we propose a Confidence Regularized Knowledge Distillation (CReg-KD) framework, which adaptively transfers knowledge for distillation in light of knowledge confidence. Two strategies are advocated to regularize the global and local dependencies between teacher and student knowledge. In detail, a gated distillation mechanism is proposed to soften the transferred knowledge globally by utilizing the teacher loss as a confidence score. Moreover, the intermediate representations are attentively and locally refined with key semantic context to mimic meaningful features. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, we evaluated the framework on two brain imaging analysis tasks (i.e. Alzheimer's Disease classification and brain age estimation based on T1-weighted MRI) on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset including 902 subjects and a cohort of 3655 subjects from 4 public datasets. Extensive experimental results show that CReg-KD achieves consistent improvements over the baseline teacher model and outperforms other state-of-theart knowledge distillation approaches, manifesting that CReg-KD as a powerful medical image analysis tool in terms of both promising prediction performance and generalizability.

AB The combustion and emission of coal have always been a concern. A class of multi-objective Environmental Economic Dispatch (EED) problems has been widely studied to reduce the pollution problem of fossil fuel power plants. In this study, a multi-objective Multi-Verse Optimization algorithm based on Gridded Knee Points and Plane Measurement technique (GKPPM-MVO) is proposed for the multiobjective EED problems. Knee points are usually considered as the most critical points in unbiased decision-making, while plane measurement can find the largest distant points in the population neighborhood. We apply the knee and maximum plane distance points in the local search phase. The original mechanism of parameter control in local search is replaced by using the two above points to exploit the pretty information and inherit it to the next generation. The algorithm is applied to various EED problems. The four algorithms, including MOMVO, NSGA-ii, MOABC, and MOEGO are also used to compare the performance of the algorithms thoroughly. Results show that the GKPPM-MVO algorithm has good convergence performance, high stability, and high uniformity of the Pareto Front. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Network architecture search (NAS) has attracted much attention as an automatic design technique of network architecture. In particular, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been a popular kind of optimizer in NAS due to their global optimization capability. However, as a populationbased iterative search method, MOEAs are subject to the unbearable computational cost of individual evaluation on multiple objectives at each generation, which affects their generalization ability and transferability of MOEA-based NAS. Therefore, an adaptive segmented multi-objective evolutionary network architecture search (ASMEvoNAS) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an adaptive segmented evaluation strategy is designed to adaptively select different but more suitable objectives to efficiently assess the candidate architectures at different evolutionary stages, instead of evaluating them by all the considered objectives simultaneously. Thus, the computational cost and complexity of the search process can be controlled and reduced to some extent. Secondly, a preference-based pre-selection strategy is designed to filter out the initialized architectures with high parameter quantities to reduce the total parameter scale of the whole population and memory consumption. Last, a novel desirable gene reservation-based crossover and a directed connection-based mutation are proposed to produce offspring. Experimental results show that ASMEvoNAS shows promising performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with error rates of 2.21%, 15.57%, and 24.43% top-1, respectively. The proposed method reduces the search cost to 0.36 GPU-Days on CIFAR-10 while maintaining competitive classification performance compared to state-of-the-art networks. In addition, ASMEvoNAS presents superior performance when dealing with the considered transfer tasks, as well as the benchmark dataset of NAS.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Visual scene understanding mainly depends on pixel-wise classification obtained from a deep convolutional neural network. However, existing semantic segmentation models often face difficulties in real-time appli-cations due to their large network architecture. Although there are real-time semantic segmentation models available, their shallow backbone can degrade the performance considerably. This paper introduces SDBNetV2, a lightweight semantic segmentation model designed to improve real-time performance without increasing computational costs. A key contribution is a novel Short-term Dense Bottleneck (SDB) module in the encoder, which provides varied field-of-views to capture different geometrical objects in a complex scene. Additionally, we propose dense feature refinement and improved semantic aggregation modules at the decoder end to enhance contextualization and object localization. We evaluate the proposed model's performance on several indoor and outdoor datasets in structured and unstructured environments. The results show that SDBNetV2 achieves superior segmentation performance over other real-time models with less than 2 million parameters.

ID MODEL
AB Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is challenging due to the subtle inter-class variations. Key region location and discriminative feature extraction are the crucial aspects of FGVC. In this paper, we carry out research from the perspective of multi-granularity and multi-scale, explore the information in different granularities and scales, and propose a novel method called Multi-Scale Network via Progressive Multi-Granularity Attention (MSMGA-Net), which locates the key discriminative regions while avoiding recognition confusion caused by subtle inter-class variations. In order to achieve discriminative region locating, we adopt a progressive training strategy to make the network work in steps during training process, and the jigsaw puzzle generator (JPGen) is constructed to generate images with different granularity for different training steps. The focus of each step of training is to locate the key discriminative regions of specific granularity image at the corresponding stage of the network through the multi-granularity attention (MGA) module. Aiming to obtain the discriminative features, we also construct a multi-scale convolution (MSC) module for feature extraction correspond-ing to each step respectively, enabling the capture of different scales of details. We validated our MSMGA-Net through extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, FGVC Aircraft and Stanford Cars. The experiments demonstrate that MSMGA-Net can get promising results. In particular, the accuracy on two publicly competitive benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and FGVC Aircraft, reached 90.30% and 93.84%, respectively. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates the transportation task of Health-care waste (HCW). The particularity of HCW, compared to ordinary waste, is that it may contain infectious and/or toxic substances. The disposal of this waste involves transporting it from healthcare facilities (HCF) to treatment centers. This step can be threatening to humans and the environment if not managed with the utmost care. To ensure the safe management of HCW, the separation policy between dangerous and normal waste should be honored. Hence, a vehicle routing problem with multi-compartment vehicles is adopted with the underlying objective of minimizing the total travel distance. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, an adaptive evolutionary algorithm is proposed based on the results of pre-post statistical tests of the population. The proposed algorithm is compared to the best so far solutions on medium and large instances using benchmarks from the literature. The experimental study confirms the efficiency of the proposed approach against the competing algorithms. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the managerial insights of the studied problem. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A data-driven digital twin based on the sequence-to-sequence (StS) model is introduced in this study. The rolling training algorithm is presented as a plug-in in StS training to achieve long-term rolling predictions. The model performs long-term horizontal predictions over 8-days based on initial observed data and manipulation sequence conditions without any new historical inputs. The digital twin model is validated using the dynamic simulation of the vapor-recompression C3 process. When the rolling training algorithm is used, the StS model demonstrates the best predictions than the traditional artificial neural network model and simple StS model for 1-and 8-days tests. Moreover, noise added cannot affect the prediction performance of StS with rolling training, and the step-change test validated the StS with rolling training containing physical meaning. Hence, the proposed StS model is a data -driven digital twin having physical interpretability. The StS model can implement long-term rolling predictions for days.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The supply chain scheduling problem, which is an integrated production scheduling and distribution through the batch delivery system, has been studied by researchers for more than two decades. So far, all researches in this regard have studied the two-echelon supply chain network. The first novelty of this research is that, for the first time, the three-echelon supply chain scheduling problem, including supplier, manufacturer and customer, is investigated considering two separated batch delivery systems for transportation, simultaneously. To do so, a two-stage assembly flow shop environment is used. In the first stage, there are a number of decentralized suppliers who are responsible for manufacturing components. The components are dispatched to the second stage (assembly stage) with the first batch delivery system and after assembly, the orders are dispatched to the customer through secondary batch delivery system. The purpose of this problem is to minimize the cost of total completion time plus batch delivery costs. First, a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is presented that is able to solve small-size instances in a logical time. The second novelty of this research is that, to solve large-size instances, a novel gamified teaching-learning based optimization (GTLBO) algorithm is developed with applying a number of dominance rules and gamification tools. The computational results indicate the superiority of the new TLBO variant over its standard form and two well-known methods, i.e. GA and PSO, especially by applying the dominance rules.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The main objective of this study is to formulate and solve the model of non-linear fixed-charge transportation problem (NFCTP), which is one of the NP-hard problems. This type of problem is challenging to solve using conventional methods because these methods are usually inefficient, costly to compute, and may stuck at the local optimum solution. To overcome this issue, a non-linear particle swarm optimization (NPSO) algorithm with new non-linear acceleration parameters is proposed in this study. Also, to preserve the feasibility condition (non-negative integer solution) of the transportation problem, two novel negative repair and fraction repair strategies have been incorporated into the proposed NPSO. The efficiency of the NPSO algorithm is tested on both the small-scale and large-scale NFCTPs. The dataset are considered from the existing studies. The obtained results are compared with those obtained by the spanning tree-based genetic algorithm (st-GA), priority-based genetic algorithm (pb-GA), and minimum cost flow-based genetic algorithm. The comparative study reveals that for all the considered problems, the proposed NPSO provides better feasible solutions in lesser computational time. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the NPSO algorithm is shown by comparing it to other seven existing variants of PSO and is found to outperformed these variants for the small scale as well as large scale NFCTPs. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB There are two unique challenges in current research of price volatility studies in the crude oil futures market, which is how to capture the impact of interactivity between data as much as possible when multi-dimensional data are fused, and how to solve the problem of temporal heterogeneity of research samples existing in multi-dimensional data. We proposed a tensor-based event-driven gated recurrent unit (Event-GRU) deep learning model that helps to solve the above dilemmas. Our model can effectively prevent the loss of interaction relationship of multi-dimensional data by taking the advantage of spatial data representation of tensor, as well as using news occurrence as a trigger to construct the event-driven mechanism based on GRU model, in order to overcome the feature space distortion between discrete news data and continuous trading fundamentals data due to the uneven sample time matching. Regarding the current insufficient research of crude oil prices in China, we addressed the crude oil futures trading data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange and 31,422 news data of the crude oil futures market from April 2018 to August 2020. We used the XGBoost algorithm (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to evaluate and filter. Besides, we built a tensor-based event-GRU deep learning model to finally analyze the closing price on the day after. This research contributes to improving the accuracy of crude oil futures price analysis compared with using benchmark models such as DT, SVM, BP, LSTM, and GRU, and laying the foundation for the subsequent opening of corresponding quantitative investment strategies.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   learning; Computer vision
AB Semi-supervised object detection methods have become increasingly popular in computer vision owing to their success in reducing data labeling costs. However, low-quality pseudo-labels exhibit difficulties in correction and severely limit the performance of existing state-of-the-art models. To address these problems, based on the contemporary teacher-student dual framework, we develop a novel self-correcting pseudo-label module to generate more reliable predictions for unlabeled data. Simultaneously, to mitigate the inherent class bias in pseudo-labels, we integrate multi-label classification results for measuring the re-balanced focal loss to enable class-agnostic, robust semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, pseudo-label-guided copy-paste is proposed as a simple yet efficient data augmentation technique to enhance instance representation learning within diverse complex scenes. The above key designs constitute our proposed approach, which we call Robust Teacher. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that Robust Teacher achieves competitive results and outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin. Our comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the key components. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Complicateddd/RobustT.

AB Consider the problem of generating humanoid motions in an environment consisting of horizontal patches located at different heights (world of stairs). To this end, the paper proposes an integrated scheme which combines footstep planning and gait generation. In particular, footsteps are produced by a randomized algorithm that guarantees both feasibility and quality of the plan according to a chosen criterion; whereas for 3D gait generation we devise an ad hoc extension of the Intrinsically Stable MPC scheme. In its basic form, the proposed scheme addresses the off-line case (known environments), but a sensor-based adaptation is developed for the on-line case (unknown environments) based on an anytime version of the footstep planner. In order to validate the proposed approach, we present simulations in CoppeliaSim for the HRP-4 humanoid robot navigating scenarios of different complexity, both in the on-line and off-line case.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB With the rise and vigorous development of artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining methodologies, machine learning (ML) has been successfully and widely used in industrial fields. For hot-rolled strips, both the rolling mechanism analyzing and multi-indicators integrated optimization are difficulties in hot rolling process. To overcome the limitations of multi-variable, nonlinear, and strong coupling in the process of hot rolling, and to improve the prediction accuracy of multi-output regression model, a novel model of rolling mechanism guided ML was developed. Mechanism data were calculated as added input features to participate in training process by way of dimensionality processing (DP). Simultaneously, genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted to realize multi-objective optimization of multi-output support vector regression (M-SVR) to further enhance the performance of model ultimately. Especially, the experimental results of root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) of strip crown and thickness are 2.5218, 0.9891 and 2.1302, 0.9902, respectively, which fully demonstrates that this method does not limit the prediction accuracy but greatly improved the generalization ability.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Asa typical production model in manufacturing industry, Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) has an important impact on enhancing the productivity of enterprises. Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem with Lot Streaming (FJSP-LS) is an extension of FJSP that allows jobs to be split into multiple sublots so they can be processed and transported separately. Since FJSP-LS has a large solution space and it is difficult and unstable for many algorithms to find a high-quality solution, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm combining Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Bee Colony (RL-ABC) algorithm. In RL-ABC, the utilities for solving FJSP-LS are divided into 2 stages: (1) determining the best dispatch scheme and (2) determining the best scheme of sublots. For stage 1, an algorithm with different initialization and local search strategies is proposed. For stage 2, reinforcement learning is developed by building mappings between the environment and schemes of sublots. The effectiveness and robustness of RL-ABC algorithm and its components are compared with five algorithms including three types (traditional heuristic algorithm, improved heuristic algorithm and new evolutionary algorithm) on nineteen benchmark instances and three real instances. The results show that although RL-ABC algorithm exhibits inferior performance in terms of CPU time, its effectiveness and robustness surpass all the other compared algorithms on all instances. Moreover, both components of the RL-ABC algorithm effectively reduce the Makespan. Therefore, it can be used as a new technique to solve large-scale and complex problems in scheduling domain.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on the assembly line balancing problem has been continuously incorporated the character-istics of actual production lines without considering the mixed-model two-sided assembly line with unpaced synchronous transfer, which is common in body shops of cars or trucks. This study attempts to model a mixed-model two-sided assembly line balancing and sequencing problem with unpaced synchronous transfer, and designs a genetic algorithm to solve this problem. First, to describe the process whereby model sequence and its execution, station and its number, and the process time caused by task allocation lead to the variable output of an unpaced synchronous line, a model without an observation point restriction is proposed. Based on this, a mathematical model of a balancing and sequencing problem of a mixed-model two-sided assembly line with an unpaced synchronous transfer is established, in which the balancing problem is aimed at Type-II. Then, an improved genetic algorithm adapted to the complexity of the problem is proposed. The algorithm designs a combination and evaluation mechanism to ensure that the solution populations of the balancing and sequencing problems are sufficiently combined and evaluated in each iteration to improve efficiency. The proposed algorithm is illustrated using a small numerical example. Finally, the algorithm is experimentally investigated using a set of test cases and several comparison algorithms. The experimental results show that the combination and evaluation mechanism is suitable for these problems, especially for large-sized cases, and that the proposed algorithm is effective and has better performance than the comparison algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In an industrial environment, accurate fault diagnosis of machines is crucial to prevent shutdowns, failures, maintenance costs, and production downtime. Existing methods for system failure prevention are often unsatisfactory and expensive, prompting the need for alternative approaches. Acoustic signals have emerged as a new method for predicting machine component lifespan, but recognizing relevant features and distinguishing them from noise remains challenging. To address the aforementioned challenges, we present a comprehensive model that integrates various components to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of machine process identification. The proposed model incorporates a deep learning algorithm, which enables the forecasting of machine operation based on acoustic signals. In addition, we employ a customized Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) technique to convert the acoustic signals into CWT images, preserving vital information such as signal amplitude. This transformation allows for a more comprehensive analysis and representation of the acoustic data. Furthermore, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized as a powerful classifier to accurately classify and differentiate between different machine processes based on the extracted features from the CWT images. By combining these elements, our model provides a robust and efficient framework for machine process identification using acoustic signals. Testing our model on a dataset generated from the Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Machine Tools (IFW) for the Gildemeister machine (CTX420 linear), we achieve over 97% accuracy in discovering and early detecting emerging faults and machine processes based on acoustic signals.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Currently, the object tracking algorithm based on the siamese network is the most popular research direction of object tracking. However, most siamese network trackers are unable to update the template, resulting in hardly dealing with the fuzzy target well, which requires the trackers to extract the target features in the template more accurately. Moreover, most of the siamese network trackers compute the similarity between the target template and the search region in a global matching way. Thus they cannot well handle the rapid change of the target. To address the above limitations, we propose an object tracking algorithm based on 3D attention SimAM and multiple graph attention. We combine siamese networks with 3D attention to improve the feature extraction capability of the network. We frame the target template and search region to improve feature-matching accuracy by introducing multiple graph attention mechanisms. We test our model against three authoritative benchmarks, GOT10K, UAV123 and OTB100, and compare it with advanced trackers, and the results show that our trackers achieve better results.

AB The ever-changing and dynamic market environment requires applying job shop systems based on real-time data. The establishment of physical-virtual systems in the production process has led to the emergence of intelligent factories. Compared with those employing traditional production methods, such factories manufacture products with higher quality, higher production speed, and other economic benefits. Regarding the virtual connections of factories, events such as the arrival of new jobs, and machine breakdowns, are identified by Radio Frequency Identification System between different production units, and related decisions are made quickly and carefully. In this intelligent job shop scheduling, it is assumed that independent factories create virtual production networks in which, each factory focuses on its own interests. Regarding the importance of this issue in today's industry, this research explores the real-time scheduling problem in multi-agent production networks distributed in smart factories. Since this problem is a combination of static scheduling and real-time scheduling, a bi-objective model of mixed-integer linear programming is first developed. An approach is then proposed to solve the dynamic real-time scheduling problem. In addition, a learning-based memetic algorithm for solving large-size bi-objective instances is proposed due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem. Afterward, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the hybrid Pareto-based tabu search algorithm. The computational results show that in large-size instances, the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing algorithm.

AB Label distribution learning (LDL) has the potential to resolve boundary ambiguity in semantic segmentation tasks. However, existing LDL-based segmentation methods suffer from severe label distribution imbalance: the ambiguous label distributions contain a small fraction of the data, while the unambiguous label distributions occupy the majority of the data. The imbalanced label distributions induce model-biased distribution learning and make it challenging to accurately predict ambiguous pixels. In this paper, we propose a curriculum label distribution learning (CLDL) framework to address the above data imbalance problem by performing a novel task-oriented curriculum learning strategy. Firstly, the region label distribution learning (R-LDL) is proposed to construct more balanced label distributions and improves the imbalanced model learning. Secondly, a novel learning curriculum (TCL) is proposed to enable easy-to-hard learning in LDL-based segmentation by decomposing the segmentation task into multiple label distribution estimation tasks. Thirdly, the prior perceiving module (PPM) is proposed to effectively connect easy and hard learning stages based on the priors generated from easier stages. Benefiting from the balanced label distribution construction and prior perception, the proposed CLDL effectively conducts a curriculum learning-based LDL and significantly improves the imbalanced learning. We evaluated the proposed CLDL using the publicly available BRATS2018 and MM-WHS2017 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves different segmentation metrics compared to many state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available.1

AB In evolutionary computation, search methodologies based on Hyper Cube (HC) are common while those based on Hyper Spherical (HS) methodologies are scarce. Spherical Search (SS), a recently proposed method that is based on HS search methodology has been proven to perform well on bound constraint problems due to its better exploration capability. In this paper, we extend SS to solve Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs) by combining the epsilon constraint handling method with a gradient-based repair framework that comprises of -a) Gradient Repair Method (GRM) which is a combination of Levenberg-Marquardt and Broyden update to reduce the computational complexity and settle numerical instabilities, b) Trigger mechanism that determines when to trigger the GRM, and c) repair ratio that determines the probability of repairing a solution in the population. Ultimately, we verify the performance of the proposed algorithm on IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark COPs along with 11 power system problems from a test suite of real-world COPs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is better than or at least comparable to other advanced algorithms on a wide range of COPs.

AB Energy efficiency is a critical issue in the management and operation of data centers, which form the backbone of cloud computing. Virtual machine placement has a significant impact on the energy efficiency of virtualized data centers. Among various methods to solve the virtual-machine placement problem, the genetic algorithm has been well accepted for its quality of solution. However, it is com-putationally demanding largely due to the complex form of fitness function, limiting its applications in data centers. To enhance the computational efficiency of the genetic algorithm while maintaining its quality of solution, a progressive-fidelity approach is developed in this paper for genetic-algorithm computation. It starts with a low-fidelity genetic algorithm with a simple fitness function. Then, for solution refinement, it switches to a medium-fidelity genetic algorithm with a more complicated fitness function. Finally, it progresses to the fine tuning of solution through a high-fidelity genetic algorithm with the energy consumption of data centers as fitness function. Heuristics are presented for the adaptive switching of genetic-algorithm computation from low fidelity to medium fidelity and finally to high fidelity. Experiments show that compared with the standard genetic algorithm of high fidelity, our progressive-fidelity approach of genetic algorithm computation is 50% faster for large-scale data centers while maintaining similar quality of solution in terms of the energy consumption of data centers.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Selecting an optimal product design scheme requires considering multiple criteria and engaging the wisdom of crowds. However, existing studies regarding design selection rarely considered the participation of group wisdom, and few studies considered subjective reports and physiological index data comprehensively for evaluation. This study developed a multi-subgroup decision-making method based on the participation of designers, experts, and customers. Multi-modal aggregation strategies are applied to aggregate subjective evaluations of both individuals and groups represented in probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs), objective eye movement, and Electroencephalogram feature data. Specifically, a probabilistic linguistic information aggregation operator based on the Choquet integral is proposed to aggregate the values of subjective criteria with correlations, and the double normalization-based multi-aggregation method is then applied to aggregate objective criteria values, which can avoid information loss in the normalization and aggregation. Finally, the Choquet integral -based Borda operator is developed to integrate the evaluation results of multiple subgroups. An example of evaluating intelligent shared vehicle design schemes is presented to validate the proposed method. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of missing values is a pervasive and unavoidable phenomenon in sensor data. Despite numerous efforts from researchers to address this issue through imputation techniques, particularly in deep learning models, the unique data distributions and periods inherent in real-world sensor data are often neglected. This paper presents a novel, multistage deep learning-based imputation framework with adaptability to missing value imputation. The framework incorporates a mixture measurement index that accounts for both low-and higher-order statistical aspects of data distribution and a more adaptive evaluation metric, which improves upon traditional mean squared error. Additionally, a multistage imputation strategy and dynamic data length adjustment are integrated into the imputation process to account for variations in data periods. Empirical results on diverse sensor data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, particularly in addressing large segment imputation issues, as evidenced by improved imputation performance. The implementation and experimental results have been made publicly available on GitHub. 1 & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Because of the high cost of label collection, people are now faced with a large number of partially labeled gene expression data (plge-data). Single cell RNA-seq data (scrs-data) are a kind of important plge-data and reflect the abundance of gene transcript mRNA measured directly or indirectly in cells. For convenience, a decision information system (DIS) based on scrs-data is called a single cell gene decision space (scgd-space). Due to the high dimensionality of scrs-data, feature selection must be done before clustering and classification. The existing feature selection methods based on equivalence relation are ineffective for the scgd-space owing to the strictness of equality between information values. To solve the above problems, this paper studies the uncertainty measurement of the scgd-space based on class-consistent technology and considers its application to semi-supervised gene selection. Class-consistent technology replaces equality with approximate equality between two expression values at a gene. Based on the proposed technology, class-consistent and non-class-consistent relations on the cell set of the scgd-space are established first. Then, the scgd-space (O, A, d) is divided into labeled space (O-l, A, d) and unlabeled space (O-u, A, d). Next, four metrics of importance on each gene subset of (O, A, d) are defined. They are the weighted sum of (O-l, A, d) and (O-u, A, d) determined by the missing rate of labels and the established relations and can be used to measure the uncertainty of (O, A, d). In addition, as an application of four metrics to the scgd-space, a semi-supervised gene selection algorithm is designed. Finally, the experimental results and statistical tests on 16 large-scale scrs-data sets show that the defined metrics can effectively measure the uncertainty of the scgd-space. The designed algorithm with a high reduction rate outperforms some state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in terms of eight performance evaluation indicators. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID FORMAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, we present a detailed and complete study on data interlinking and the discovery of identity links between two RDF -Resource Description Framework- datasets over the web of data. Data interlinking is the task of discovering identity links between individuals across datasets. Link keys are constructions based on pairs of properties and classes that can be considered as rules allowing to infer identity links between subjects in two RDF datasets. Here we investigate how FCA -Formal Concept Analysis- and its extensions are well adapted to investigate and to support the discovery of link keys. Indeed plain FCA allows to discover the so-called link key candidates, while a specific pattern structure allows to associate a pair of classes with every candidate. Different link key candidates can generate sets of identity links between individuals that can be considered as equal when they are regarded as partitions of the identity relation and thus involving a kind of redundancy. In this paper, such a redundancy is deeply studied thanks to partition pattern structures. In particular, experiments are proposed where it is shown that redundancy of link key candidates while not significant when based on identity of partitions appears to be much more significant when based on similarity. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of the paper is to model ambiguity in a randomized reinsurance stop-loss treaty. For this, we consider the lower envelope of the set of bivariate joint probability distributions having a precise discrete marginal and an ambiguous Bernoulli marginal. Under an independence assumption, since the lower envelope fails 2-monotonicity, inner/outer Dempster-Shafer approximations are considered, so as to select the optimal retention level by maximizing the lower expected insurer's annual profit under reinsurance. We show that the inner approximation is not suitable in the reinsurance problem, while the outer approximation preserves the given marginal information, weakens the independence assumption, and does not introduce spurious information in the retention level selection problem. Finally, we provide a characterization of the optimal retention level.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Object pose estimation is crucial in human-computer interaction systems. The traditional point-based detection approaches rely on the robustness of feature points, the tracking methods utilize the similarity between frames to improve the speed, while the recent studies based on neural networks concentrate on solving specific invariance problems. Different from these methods, PTPE (Part-based Tracking for Pose Estimation) proposed in this paper focuses on how to balance the speed and accuracy under different conditions. In this method, the point matching is transformed into the part matching inside an object to enhance the reliability of the features. Additionally, a fast interframe tracking method is combined with learning models and structural information to enhance robustness. During tracking, multiple strategies are adopted for the different parts according to the matching effects evaluated by the learning models, so as to develop the locality and avoid the time consumption caused by undifferentiated full frame detection or learning. In addition, the constraints between parts are applied for parts detection optimization. Experiments show that PTPE is efficient both in accuracy and speed, especially in complex environments, when compared with classical algorithms that focus only on detection, interframe tracking, self-supervised models, and graph matching.

AB In the past years, deep learning has seen an increase in usage in the domain of histopathological applications. However, while these approaches have shown great potential, in high-risk environments deep learning models need to be able to judge their uncertainty and be able to reject inputs when there is a significant chance of misclassification. In this work, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of the most commonly used uncertainty and robustness methods for the classification of Whole Slide Images, with a focus on the task of selective classification, where the model should reject the classification in situations in which it is uncertain. We conduct our experiments on tile-level under the aspects of domain shift and label noise, as well as on slide-level. In our experiments, we compare Deep Ensembles, Monte-Carlo Dropout, Stochastic Variational Inference, Test-Time Data Augmentation as well as ensembles of the latter approaches. We observe that ensembles of methods generally lead to better uncertainty estimates as well as an increased robustness towards domain shifts and label noise, while contrary to results from classical computer vision benchmarks no systematic gain of the other methods can be shown. Across methods, a rejection of the most uncertain samples reliably leads to a significant increase in classification accuracy on both in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we conduct experiments comparing these methods under varying conditions of label noise. Lastly, we publish our code framework to facilitate further research on uncertainty estimation on histopathological data.

AB Digitization of pathology has been proposed as an essential mitigation strategy for the severe staffing crisis facing most pathology departments. Despite its benefits, several barriers have prevented widespread adoption of digital workflows, including cost and pathologist reluctance due to subjective image quality concerns. In this work, we quantitatively determine the minimum image quality requirements for binary classification of histopathology images of breast tissue in terms of spatial and sampling resolution. We train an ensemble of deep learning classifier models on publicly available datasets to obtain a baseline accuracy and computationally degrade these images according to our derived theoretical model to identify the minimum resolution necessary for acceptable diagnostic accuracy. Our results show that images can be degraded significantly below the resolution of most commercial whole-slide imaging systems while maintaining reasonable accuracy, demonstrating that macroscopic features are sufficient for binary classification of stained breast tissue. A rapid low-cost imaging system capable of identifying healthy tissue not requiring human assessment could serve as a triage system for reducing caseloads and alleviating the significant strain on the current workforce.

AB Identifying cancer biomarkers is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing cancer-related deaths. This research proposes BioSurv, a framework for biomarker identification and cancer survival prediction, using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Multi-omics data from breast cancer (BRCA) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), including mRNA, miRNA, CNV, and DNA methylation, are analyzed. The collected dataset is passed to statistical tests and the random spatial local best cat swarm optimization (RSLBCSO) algorithm for feature selection, followed by KEGG and survival analyses to identify prognostic markers. Thirteen BRCA and fifteen LUAD poor prognostic markers are identified. A Bayesian optimized deep neural network (DNN) is used for cancer survival prediction, achieving high accuracy of 90% and 91% for BRCA and LUAD, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes a novel methodology for recovering missing time series data, a crucial task for subsequent Machine Learning (ML) analyses. The methodology is specifically applied to Significant Wave Height (SWH) time series in the field of marine engineering. The proposed approach involves two phases. Firstly, the SWH time series for each buoy is independently reconstructed using three transfer function models: regression-based, correlation-based, and distance-based. The distance-based transfer function exhibits the best overall performance. Secondly, Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs) are utilised for the final recovery of each time series, using as inputs highly correlated buoys that have been intermediately recovered. The EANNs are evolved considering two metrics, the novel squared error relevance area, which balances the importance of extreme and around-mean values, and the well-known mean squared error. The study considers SWH time series data from 15 buoys in two coastal zones in the United States. The results demonstrate that the distance-based transfer function is generally the best transfer function, and that EANNs outperform a range of state-of-the-art ML techniques in 12 out of the 15 buoys, with a number of connections comparable to linear models. Furthermore, the proposed methodology outperforms the two most popular approaches for time series reconstruction, BRITS and SAITS, for all buoys except one. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides a promising approach, which may be applied to time series from other fields, such as wind or solar energy farms in the field of green energy.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM
AB Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are artificial neural networks that encode Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) as an integral component of the ML model. PINNs are successfully used nowadays to solve PDEs, fractional equations, and integral-differential equations, including direct and inverse problems. Just as in the case of other kinds of artificial neural networks, the architecture, including the number and sizes of layers, activation functions, and other hyperparameters can significantly influence the network performance. Despite the serious work in this field, there are still no clear directions on how to choose an optimal network architecture in a consistent manner. In practice, expertise is required, with a significant number of manual trial and error cycles. In this paper, we propose PINN/GA (PINN/Genetic Algorithm), a fully automatic design of a PINN by an evolutionary strategy with specially tailored operators of selection, crossover, and mutation, adapted for deep neural network architecture and hyperparameter search. The PINN/GA strategy starts from the population of simple PINNs, adding new layers only if it brings clear accuracy benefits, keeping PINNs in the population as simple as possible. Since the examination of dozens of neural networks through the evolutionary process implies enormous computational costs, it employs a scalable computational design based on containers and Kubernetes batching orchestration. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we chose two non-trivial direct problems. The first is 1D Stefan transient model with time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions, describing the melting process, and the second is the Helmholtz wave equation over a 2D square domain. The authors found that PINNs accuracy gradually improves throughout the evolutionary process, exhibiting better performance and stability than parallel random search and Hyperopt Tree of Parzen Estimators, while keeping the network design reasonably simple. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As a fundamental granular computing strategy, neighborhood granulation has been acknowledged as an intuitive and effective approach to feature evaluation and selection. However, such an approach always has a bias towards a fixed neighborhood granularity, while ignoring the observations across different levels of granularity. To this end, a novel algorithm based on Neighborhood relevancY, redundancY, and granularity interactivitY (N3Y) is proposed. Technically, N3Y adheres well to the rudiment of three-way decision, evaluating and selecting features in threes: 1) feature-to-class relevancy; 2) feature-to-feature redundancy; 3) granularity-to-granularity interactivity. Specifically, firstly, the neighborhood symmetrical uncertainty induced by neighborhood measures is adopted to evaluate the relevancy and redundancy of candidate feature subset; secondly, the proposed neighborhood granularity interactivity allows an uncertainty quantification for finer-to-coarser granularity, and is leveraged as a supplemental factor to guide the relevancy and redundancy, making our procedure more comprehensive; thirdly, a forward-greedy selector is devised, which is required to maximize the evaluation criterion integrating neighborhood relevancy, redundancy, and granularity interactivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that N3Y outperforms several other advanced feature selectors. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Problem: Visual secret sharing is a method used to secure images by converting a secret image into multiple shares so that the original image cannot be recognized from individual shares, and no calculations are required during the image decryption, but the original image can be visually seen by stacking the shares. However, one of the significant challenges in this method is the increased size of the shares and the recovered image, which is called pixel expansion. Researchers have proposed several methods to solve this problem, but many of them are limited to binary images, and they cannot handle gray and color images without converting them to binary. Solution: This study proposes a novel fuzzy random grid-based method to directly encrypt gray and color images without any pixel expansions. In this method, fuzzy random grids with decimal values between 0.0 to 1.0 are generated during the encryption stage, and fuzzy operators are used for the decryption stage. Results: The evaluation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution in encrypting gray and color images without converting them to binary and without any pixel expansions. The individual shares of the proposed method do not reveal any information from the original image, making it a secure method. The quality of the decrypted images has been evaluated using both subjective and objective evaluation methods such as PSNR and SSIM metrics, which show state-of-the-art results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Energy conservation is essential for a wireless sensor network to enhance its network lifetime. Clustering is one of the most important energy conservation techniques that prolong the WSN by providing balanced energy depletion across the network. Various clustering strategies have been proposed in the past to enhance the efficiency of the network till now. In the last two decades, fuzzy inference system based clustering solution has been proven to provide promising solutions. The existing fuzzy-based clustering algorithms consider the naive network parameters as input that saves only a limited amount of energy in the network. However, in wireless sensor networks, the requirement is to make them highly energy efficient through an effective clustering strategy. To achieve effective clustering there is a need for energy-centric network parameters for the clustering instead of naive network parameters. In this article, a novel energy-centric reputation index is proposed in which the naive network parameters are unified with energy parameters in the background. Further, the reputation index scores are passed into a fuzzy-based approach to obtain the fitness value of the node chosen as the cluster head. Thus, in this paper, an energy-centric reputation index and fuzzy based clustering(ECRIF) model is proposed for wireless sensor networks. The proposed model provides a highly energy-efficient wireless sensor network and is designed to work in two phases. In phase 1, three reputation indexes concerning internodal distance, distance to the sink, and the degree of the node is calculated while considering their energy consumption pattern in the background. In phase 2, the three reputation indexes are passed onto the fuzzy system as fuzzy input parameters to obtain the fitness value of the nodes for cluster head selection. Simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol enhances the overall lifetime of the network on an average by 70% in terms of the first node dies, 61% in terms of half node dies, and 78% in terms of the last node dies when compared with two other existing clustering models. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB TV program recommendation can help user find interested programs and improve user experience. The heterogeneous information of programs is important for alleviating the problem of data sparsity. In addition, the existing TV program recommendation methods are lacking in dynamics. This paper proposes a neural TV program recommendation based on dynamic long-short term interest (NPR-DLSTI), which mainly includes two modules: program and user encoder. In the program encoder module, we use convolutional neural network and attention mechanism to learn the heterogeneous information of the program and realize program representation. In the user encoder module, we use gated recurrent unit and personalized attention to learn the dynamic change law of users' interests. Experiments on real data sets show that our method can effectively improve the effectiveness and dynamics of TV program recommendation than other existing models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The problem of goal recognition requests to automatically infer an accurate probability distribution over possible goals an autonomous agent is attempting to achieve in the environment. The state-of-the-art approaches for goal recognition operate under full knowledge of the environment and possible operations the agent can take. This knowledge, however, is often not available in real-world applications. Given historical observations of the agents' behaviors in the environment, we learn skill models that capture how the agents achieved the goals in the past. Next, given fresh observations of an agent, we infer their goals by diagnosing deviations between the observations and all the available skill models. We present a framework that serves as an outline for implementing such data-driven goal recognition systems and its instance system implemented using process mining techniques. The evaluations we conducted using our publicly available implementation confirm that the approach is well-defined, i.e., all system parameters impact its performance, has high accuracy over a wide range of synthetic and real-world domains, which is comparable with the more knowledge-demanding state-of-the-art approaches, and operates fast.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB As one of the research hotspots in the field of speech recognition, content-based speech retrieval algorithms can detect speech information with the same content features, which improves computer intelligence while reducing labor costs, and thus have been widely used. Although most of the current speech content retrieval algorithms can guarantee excellent retrieval performance for small-scale speech retrieval work, the performance of the above algorithms is greatly reduced under the constraints of large speech data storage space and high content redundancy. In order to solve the above problems, a high-performance speech BioHashing retrieval algorithm based on audio segmentation is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is divided into an offline preprocessing phase and an online retrieval phase, The offline pre-processing stage converts the speech data into BioHashing sequences with speech content characteristics. In this process, first of all, the Power-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC) features of the speech data are extracted and biometric templates with single mapping keys are constructed according to the PNCC features, obtaining BioHashing sequences. Then, slice the original speeches into short-time audio segments according to the proposed audio segmentation algorithm, and the hash reconstruction operation is performed on the BioHashing sequences to obtain the reconstructed Hashing sequences for online retrieval. The online search phase responds to the users' query requests, just find the hash index that matches the query hash sequence from the BioHashing index table, and will the standardized editing distance (SED) to the closest 1 value corresponding to the hash index as the retrieval result back to the user. The experimental results show that the reconstructed hash sequences obtained after removing the silent redundant segments have better robustness and discrimination. Moreover, the algorithm achieves 100% retrieval accuracy for the original speech clips, and the average retrieval time is only 0.0157 s, which shows that the algorithm has good retrieval performance and can meet the needs of speech retrieval in various environments.

DE Adversarial robustness; Computer vision
AB Deep-learning models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of fields, owing to advancements in computational power and the availability of extensive datasets for training large-scale models. Nonetheless, these models inherently possess a vulnerability wherein even small alterations to the input can lead to substantially different outputs. Consequently, it is imperative to assess the robustness of deep-learning models prior to relying on their decision-making capabilities. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid CNNs +ViTs, which represent prevalent architectures in computer vision. Our evaluation is grounded on four novel model-sensitivity metrics that we introduce. These metrics are evaluated in the context of random noise and gradient-based adversarial perturbations. To ensure a fair comparison, we employ models with comparable capacities within each group and conduct experiments separately, utilizing ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K as pretraining data. Our fair experimental results provide empirical evidence that ViT-based models exhibit higher adversarial robustness than CNN-based counterparts, helping to dispel doubts about the findings of prior studies. Additionally, we introduce novel metrics that contribute new insights into the previously unconfirmed characteristics of these models.

AB Capturing the inner structure change of the target is crucial for a siamese tracker confronted with severe deformation or occlusion. The conventional siamese tracker utilizes a strict grid-to-grid correlation to pass the template information towards the current candidate, which may suffer severe mismatch compared to the initial frame caused by undesirable conditions such as rotation and deformation. Thus such mismatch would lead to insufficient information passed from the template and eventually end with a poor performance in classification and regression branches. The inherent CNN structure with the restricted grid-to-grid matching mechanism during correlation is not able to capture the corresponding change of the target structure. Motivated by DCNv2, we propose a novel deformation aware correlation to replace the widely-used depthwise-correlation. An offset-prediction module is proposed based on the similarity matrix to compensate for the mismatch of the grid assignment between template and candidate. Then we utilize an importance bilinear sampling algorithm to assess the similarity of the matching pair, alleviating the occlusion drift problem. Finally, a modulated deformable correlation is fed into the aforementioned input and realizes a better information modulation. We replace the correlation operator on SiamRPN++ with our deformation aware correlation operator and obtain our tracker, SiamDAC. Massive experiments on OTB100, UAV123, VOT2019, LaSOT and DTB70 validate the effectiveness of our proposed operator, especially confronted with severe deformation or occlusion.

AB Hadith is an essential and much-celebrated resource for the Islamic domain. It is one of the two primary sources of Islamic legislation. The hadith corpus is quite large, consisting of the collection of sayings, actions and silent approval of the Prophet Muhammad. Minimal efforts have been made to date, towards unified semantic modelling, and knowledge representation of the hadith structure for enhanced interlinking and knowledge discovery. This paper presents the design, development and publishing of the hadith corpus as a knowledge graph. First, we design the SemanticHadith ontology to describe and relate core structural concepts from the hadith. We then publish the six prominent hadith collections as an RDF-Based hadith knowledge graph, which is an effort towards making the available hadith both human and machine-readable. This is the first step in the annotation and linking process of the hadith corpus aimed at enabling semantic search capabilities to support scholars, students, and researchers in the creation, evolution, and consultation of a digital representation of Islamic knowledge. The SemanticHadith knowledge graph is freely accessible at http://www.semantichadith.com.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A major barrier to applying deep segmentation models in the medical domain is their typical data-hungry nature, requiring experts to collect and label large amounts of data for training. As a reaction, prototypical few-shot segmentation (FSS) models have recently gained traction as data-efficient alternatives. Nevertheless, despite the recent progress of these models, they still have some essential shortcomings that must be addressed. In this work, we focus on three of these shortcomings: (i) the lack of uncertainty estimation, (ii) the lack of a guiding mechanism to help locate edges and encourage spatial consistency in the segmentation maps, and (iii) the models' inability to do one-step multi-class segmentation. Without modifying or requiring a specific backbone architecture, we propose a modified prototype extraction module that facilitates the computation of uncertainty maps in prototypical FSS models, and show that the resulting maps are useful indicators of the model uncertainty. To improve the segmentation around boundaries and to encourage spatial consistency, we propose a novel feature refinement module that leverages structural information in the input space to help guide the segmentation in the feature space. Furthermore, we demonstrate how uncertainty maps can be used to automatically guide this feature refinement. Finally, to avoid ambiguous voxel predictions that occur when images are segmented class-by-class, we propose a procedure to perform one-step multi-class FSS. The efficiency of our proposed methodology is evaluated on two representative datasets for abdominal organ segmentation (CHAOS dataset and BTCV dataset) and one dataset for cardiac segmentation (MS-CMRSeg dataset). The results show that our proposed methodology significantly (one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, ������ < 0.05) improves the baseline, increasing the overall dice score with +5.2, +5.1, and +2.8 percentage points for the CHAOS dataset, the BTCV dataset, and the MS-CMRSeg dataset, respectively.

AB Inspired by the dendritic and axonal morphology, some authors modeled the transmission speed of action potentials through of fixed dendritic and axonal delays, respectively. However, in practice, the exploration of dendrites and axons with variable delays potentially allows the improvement of advanced engineering applications. Taking inspiration from the structure of the dendritic spines and the process of myelination of axons, we introduce a new variant of the spiking neural P systems with variable axonal and dendritic delays named as a spiking neural P system with myelin and dendritic spines computation (MDSCSN P system). The inclusion of these experimentally proven biological features of axon and den-drites into standard spiking neural P systems allows to control the timing of dendritic/axonal transmis-sions. As a consequence, the soma processing of neurons is significantly reduced since it receives stable firing patterns. In contrast, standard spiking neural P systems and their recent variants use a large num-ber of neurons/synapses to do the same. To demonstrate this, we generate a small universal SN P system by employing only neurons with standard rules to perform any Turing computable function and to figure out the Subset Sum problem in the uniform way. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID POWER POINT TRACKER; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS
AB In a recent work, (Avila et al., 2020), an environment was developed and reported for partial shading conditions (PSC) in the open-source OpenAI Gym platform. This work presented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to address the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) problem of a photovoltaic (PV) array under PSC. Two DRL algorithms, namely, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) were investigated. A deviation of less than 1%, compared to the theoretical maximum power, was claimed for the DDPG algorithm. Based on the presented fact-based investigations, this comment highlights the issues in the reported approach. The main issues are found to be the approximate PV array modeling, erroneous performance metric and erroneous choice of DRL algorithms. Of the presented PSCs, the proposed technique in Avila et al. (2020) always attained the very first peak of the PV characteristic of the PV system. It may be noted that the first peak may not always be the global maximum power point. Overall, based on the presented investigations this comment demonstrates that the DDPG technique used in Avila et al. (2020) is not able to effectively address the MPPT problem in PV array under PSC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Noisy time series prediction is a hot research topic in practical applications. Echo state networks (ESNs) have superior performance on time series prediction. However, the ill-posed problem may weaken the generalization performance of ESNs when dealing with real data, because of the noise and the overlarge reservoir. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust ESN with a Cauchy loss function and hybrid regularizations for noisy time series prediction. First, the Cauchy loss function is used to suppress the large noise mixed in the real data. Then, an improved L1 regularization and the L2 regularization are combined to shrink the larger output weights and produce the sparse solution. Particularly, a simple iterative algorithm is proposed to calculate the output weights of the network. Finally, simulation results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show the super performance of the proposed model.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fatigue driving will seriously threaten public safety and health, so monitoring the brain's cognitive state accurately and exploring the fatigue process is essential. This paper proposes a 5-D Brain Cognitive Dynamic Recognition Network (E-5-D-BCDRNet) that synchronizes the brain's cognitive changes with global features, local features, and sequence changes. The global feature refers to the 3-D brain global cognitive power maps (3-D-BGCM) constructed based on the new fatigue cognitive indicators. Local features refer to the 1-D brain local cognitive array (1-D-BLCA) created based on fatigue recognition contribution of different rhythms in each brain region. This paper uses a non-invasive wearable device to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 14 subjects to evaluate the model's performance. Compared with the existing advanced methods, the proposed method achieves the best detection effect (88.5%). In addition, this study finds that the features learned based on different indicators are different and distributed in various brain regions by presenting the learned characteristics. Moreover, by comparing the detection results based on the local features of a single rhythm, this study finds that the frontal and occipital regions of the driver are significantly different before and after. More importantly, only a single region can also achieve significant detection effects, which shows that our method can achieve satisfactory results based on small data. In a word, the research in this paper can lay a theoretical foundation for real-time brain fatigue detection and promote the development of intelligent transportation systems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB A bipolar fuzzy competition graph helps to examine the competition between two vertices when they have a common out-neighbourhood. With this idea, the bipolar fuzzy p-competition graph (BFpCG) can be defined when two vertices have p common out-neighbourhood. In this study, the above-said concepts are defined along with certain characteristics such as low, high, semi-perfect and perfect competitive competition graphs based on the number of components, and certain important results are derived. Moreover, the extensions of BFpCG are discussed by considering various situations and illustrated by a food web problem of 13 species. Besides, an application is taken to find the competition among the COVID-19 vaccines against five mutations: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques utilize to access the prioritization problems. The additive ratio assessment (ARAS) is a robust MCDM technique and it simplifies complex decision-making problems through the utility degree. An efficient outcome can be attained by this technique when it works with positive and negative perceptions. Therefore, this study constructs a novel bipolar fuzzy ARAS system based on the BFpCG. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system, an application is taken in prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines, where Moderna and CoronaVac resulted in first and last rank, respectively. For this purpose, the efficacy rate of the vaccines against severe disease is considered. Finally, the outcomes are validated through sensitivity and comparative analyses. Then, the managerial implications, future works and limitations of the study are provided to explore the proposed research. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In terms of improving coil resource utilization and customer satisfaction, most steel companies are still far behind in these quality objectives and need significant improvements. Scientific approaches to production and operations planning are critical to improve its situation. Motivated by this phenomenon, this study investigates a challenging operations decision problem on allocating open-order coils to customer orders in the steel industry. In this article, a dynamic multiobjective optimization model is formulated to optimize the total mismatching costs, surplus inventory and coil utilization considering various practical dynamisms, such as production changes and unscheduled arrivals of new customer orders. To address this problem, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on knee driven change response strategy and Pareto local search mechanism, so called KPLSEA. This proposed approach, which combines the information of decision-making stages with the evolutionary search, significantly reduces the computational cost and promotes the evolutionary search to converge quickly. Extensive experiments are performed on real-world production benchmark instances. Computational comparisons with other state-of-art algorithms validate that the proposed algorithm could generate effective and practical solutions in dynamic environments as well as provide the decision makers with a satisfied near-optimal solution.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; TRANSFORMATIONS; FEATURES; REPRESENTATIONS
AB This paper discusses how automatic speech recognition systems are and could be designed, in order to best exploit the discriminative information encoded in human speech. This contrasts with many recent machine learning approaches that apply general recognition architectures to signals to identify, with little concern for the nature of the input. The implicit assumption has often been that training can automatically discover the useful properties that exist in signals, with minimal manual intervention. These approaches may be suitable for some tasks such as image recognition, where the diversity of visual input is vast; e.g., an image may be any (natural or synthetic) scene that a camera views. We first examine what makes speech special, i.e., a natural signal from a complex tube, driven by a source that is quasi-periodic and/or noisy, aiming to communicate a wide variety of information, using the different vocal systems of human speakers. Then, we view how pertinent features are extracted from speech via efficient means, related to the objectives of communication. We see how to reliably and efficiently identify the different units of oral language. We learn from the history of attempts to do ASR, e.g., why they succeeded and how improved methods exploited the increasing availability of data and computer power (in particular, deep neural networks). Finally, we suggest ways to render ASR both more accurate and efficient. This work is aimed at both newcomers to ASR and experts, in terms of presenting issues broadly, but without mathematical or algorithmic details, which are readily found in the references.

AB Outdoor photography is greatly affected by bad rainfall, which degrades the quality of captured images and hinders practical application. In response to the above problems, we propose a memory-efficient multi-scale residual dense network (MMRD-Net) for single image rain removal. Firstly, we use a combination or fusion of extended convolution blocks of different sizes to accurately extract multi-scale features of rain streaks and raindrops while retaining rich local detail. Secondly, we add attention modules to the residual block, which performs adaptive operations on rainfall and non-rainfall areas to extract more and more accurate image features and details of rain streaks and raindrops. During this period, we opened up a space for shared use by all the concatenation layers in the network, which reduces the memory consumption of the network. It allows for better aggregation of stormwater features at multiple levels and also allows for faster convergence of the network. Finally, we tested on both synthetic and real datasets to obtain subjective results and objective evaluations. The experimental results show that the performance of our algorithm is good and robust for joint rain removal tasks of different densities. Our algorithm outperforms twelve other different classical algorithms in terms of its ability to remove rain streaks. It can produce visually sharper deraining images and the enhanced visibility of the images is effective for computer vision applications (Google Vision API).

AB Multiple regression has been proven to be a reliable method for solving prediction problems that require many independent variables. The biggest challenge in multiple regression is that the number of samples given must be sufficient based on the number of independent variables. In some cases, it may not be possible to eliminate the independent variables via feature selection. This study aims to build a multiple linear regression problem-solving model using Sugeno's fuzzy inference system (FIS) approach. The main contribution of this study is to provide an alternative model for performing linear regression, which has quite a lot of independent variables but not too many datasets. The case that was resolved was the prediction of serum iron (SI) based on nine independent variables of hematology measurement results. The proposed FIS model uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to produce fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. The Gauss membership function is used as the membership function in each fuzzy set. The output of the fuzzy rules is a linear equation based on the Sugeno Order 1 fuzzy inference method. To test the performance of the model, a comparison of the mean square error (MSE) output of the system with classical multiple linear regression (CMLR) and backpropagation neural networks (BNNs) was performed. In nine scenarios, comparisons were made. The results showed that FIS had the best performance in each scenario. In training data, FIS had the best performance with an MSE of 0.0148, followed by CMLR and BNN with MSEs of 0.0180 and 0.0285, respectively. Whereas in data testing, FIS had the best performance with an MSE of 0.0239, followed by BNN and CMLR with MSEs of 0.0246 and 0.0255, respectively. Even in scenarios where there is little training data, FIS still shows good performance, with MSEs of 0.0219 and 0.0402 on training and testing data, respectively.

AB A variety of algorithms have been proposed for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia from anatomical brain MRI. These approaches achieve high accuracy when applied to research data sets but their performance on real-life clinical routine data has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this work was to study the performance of such approaches on clinical routine data, based on a hospital data warehouse, and to compare the results to those obtained on a research data set. The clinical data set was extracted from the hospital data warehouse of the Greater Paris area, which includes 39 different hospitals. The research set was composed of data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set. In the clinical set, the population of interest was identified by exploiting the diagnostic codes from the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases that are assigned to each patient. We studied how the imbalance of the training sets, in terms of contrast agent injection and image quality, may bias the results. We demonstrated that computer-aided diagnosis performance was strongly biased upwards (over 17 percent points of balanced accuracy) by the confounders of image quality and contrast agent injection, a phenomenon known as the Clever Hans effect or shortcut learning. When these biases were removed, the performance was very poor. In any case, the performance was considerably lower than on the research data set. Our study highlights that there are still considerable challenges for translating dementia computer-aided diagnosis systems to clinical routine.

AB Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used modalities for clinical intervention and diagnosis due to the merits of providing non-invasive, radiation-free, and real-time images. However, free-hand US examinations are highly operator-dependent. Robotic US System (RUSS) aims at overcoming this shortcoming by offering reproducibility, while also aiming at improving dexterity, and intelligent anatomy and disease-aware imaging. In addition to enhancing diagnostic outcomes, RUSS also holds the potential to provide medical interventions for populations suffering from the shortage of experienced sonographers. In this paper, we categorize RUSS as teleoperated or autonomous. Regarding teleoperated RUSS, we summarize their technical developments, and clinical evaluations, respectively. This survey then focuses on the review of recent work on autonomous robotic US imaging. We demonstrate that machine learning and artificial intelligence present the key techniques, which enable intelligent patient and process-specific, motion and deformation-aware robotic image acquisition. We also show that the research on artificial intelligence for autonomous RUSS has directed the research community toward understanding and modeling expert sonographers' semantic reasoning and action. Here, we call this process, the recovery of the "language of sonography". This side result of research on autonomous robotic US acquisitions could be considered as valuable and essential as the progress made in the robotic US examination itself. This article will provide both engineers and clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of RUSS by surveying underlying techniques. Additionally, we present the challenges that the scientific community needs to face in the coming years in order to achieve its ultimate goal of developing intelligent robotic sonographer colleagues. These colleagues are expected to be capable of collaborating with human sonographers in dynamic environments to enhance both diagnostic and intraoperative imaging.

AB Meta-learning has recently been an emerging data-efficient learning technique for various medical imaging operations and has helped advance contemporary deep learning models. Furthermore, meta -learning enhances the knowledge generalization of the imaging tasks by learning both shared and discriminative weights for various configurations of imaging tasks during training. However, existing meta-learning models attempt to learn a single set of weight initializations of a neural network that might be fundamentally restrictive under the heterogeneous (multimodal) data scenario. This work aims to develop a multimodal meta-learning model for image reconstruction, which augments meta -learning with evolutionary capabilities to encompass diverse acquisition settings of heterogeneous data. Our proposed model called KM-MAML (Kernel Modulation-based Multimodal Meta -Learning), has hypernetworks (auxiliary learners) that evolve to generate mode-specific (or context-specific) weights. These weights provide the mode-specific inductive bias for multiple modes by re-calibrating each kernel of the base network for image reconstruction via a low-rank kernel modulation operation. Furthermore, we incorporate gradient-based meta-learning (GBML) in the contextual space to update the weights of the hypernetworks based on different modes. The hypernetworks and the base reconstruction network in the GBML setting provide discriminative mode-specific features and low-level image features, respectively. We extensively evaluate our model for multi-contrast magnetic resonance image reconstruction considering the essential research directions in fastMRI for multimodal and rich transfer learning capabilities across various MRI contrasts. Our comparative studies show that the proposed model (i) exhibits superior reconstruction performance over joint training, other meta-learning methods, and various context-specific MRI reconstruction architectures, and (ii) better adaptation to 80% and 92% of unseen multi-contrast data contexts with improvement margins of 0.1 to 0.5 dB in PSNR and around 0.01 in SSIM, respectively. Besides, a representation analysis with U-Net as the base network shows that kernel modulation infuses 80% of mode-specific representation changes in the high-resolution layers.

ID IMAGE; MODEL
AB Anisotropic diffusion is one of the most effective methods used in image processing. It can be used to eliminate the small textures of an image while preserving its significant edges. In this paper, a new anisotropic diffusion filter is proposed based on a fractional calculus kernel rather than integer kernel to improve the overall performance of the filter. Integer and fractional anisotropic filters are implemented using the Genesys-2 FPGA kit to utilize the efficiency of parallelism in FPGAs. Integer and fractional anisotropic filters are tested against the achievable PSNR value vs the number of iterations. The proposed fractional anisotropic filter has a better PSNR value using a smaller number of iterations, reducing the power and area compared to integer anisotropic filter. The proposed filter can be used in image smoothing, edge detection, image segmentation, image denoising, and cartooning. In addition, the proposed filter reduces the power consumption by 58.2% compared to integer-order filters, which makes the proposed filter suitable for battery-based applications.

AB In recent years, the navigation capabilities of mobile robots in off-road environments have increased significantly, opening up new potential applications in a variety of settings. By accurately identifying different types of terrain in unstructured environments, safe automated navigation can be supported. However, to enable safe path planning and execution, the traversability costs of the terrain types need to be accurately estimated. Such estimations are often performed manually by experts who possess information about the environment and are familiar with the capabilities of the robotic system or using simplified experiments. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline for generating traversability costs that use recorded locomotion data from a realistic experiment and descriptive information on the terrain obtained from earth observation data. The main contribution is that the cost estimation for different terrain types is based on locomotion data obtained in realistic standardized experiments. Moreover, by repeating the experiments with different robot systems we are easily able to reflect the actual capabilities of the systems. Experiments were conducted in an alpine off-road environment to record locomotion data of four different robot systems and to investigate the performance and validity of the proposed pipeline.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM
AB Decision variable analysis (DVA) methods have provided the promising direction in solving large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). However, most existing DVA-based methods still have the problem of high evaluation consumption, which limits the performance of solving LMOPs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new redefined DVA method with low-consumption for solving LMOPs, called R-DVA. Specifically, R-DVA detects the interrelationship among convergent decision variables by using a distance-based hierarchical clustering method, which does not need to generate lots of solutions, thus saving a large number of evaluation consumption. In addition, to improve the performance of population, an evolutionary-state-oriented evolutionary (EsoE) strategy with two search models is designed in R-DVA, which can monitor the evolutionary state of population and perform different search models according to different evolutionary states. Specifically, the intra-group optimization model is used to accelerate the convergence speed when the population is in the exploration state. Moreover, a quality-based segmentation competitive swarm optimizer is designed in the inter-group optimization model, aiming to enhance the diversity of the population when the population is in the exploitation state. In this way, a good trade-off between the convergence and diversity can be achieved via the EsoE strategy. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed R-DVA achieves the best results in comparison to five state-of-the-art competitive algorithms on most adopted benchmark LMOPs and a real-world large-scale application, i.e., feature selection.

AB In contrast to the stable development of the traditional face to face teaching, distance education has become a considerable portion in higher education today and it is still rapidly growing. The mixed modes in education promote a great challenge for the professors and administrators to accurately and fairly evaluate the performance of students. Indeed, students' performance evaluation is a multicriteria decision problem. To obtain a robust auxiliary decision support scheme compatible with the preferences of decision maker (DM), challenges often confronted in multicriteria decision analysis include dealing with complex structure of criteria, handling interaction between criteria and reducing the cognitive efforts of the DM. Based on the disaggregation-aggregation principle, complex preference is refined into smaller, manageable modules from two dimensions of alternative evaluation and criteria hierarchy. Then, a hierarchical-level-bidirectional Choquet integral preference method is developed to reproduce the refined preference and obtain the comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives. Further, a class of non-additive robust ordinal regression is performed by utilizing the characteristic indicators of the new Choquet integral and the preference relations given by the DM. Moreover, a representative preference method is put forward to rule out some preconceived possible relations, which enriches the necessary relations among alternatives. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to verify the practicability of the above multicriteria decision support methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Water surface object detection; Deep learning; YOLOv5; Attention module;
   Ghost module
AB In recent years, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have been widely used in water surface monitoring and management. The main problems of the USVs-based water surface object detection method are that the features will be lost when downsampling complex water surface environment images, resulting in low detection accuracy. Moreover, the number of parameters and calculation amount of these models are too much, which will seriously affect the speed of training and detection. Therefore, this paper proposed the ATT-YOLOv5-Ghost algorithm. First, we added an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module to each CSP1 unit of the backbone CSPDarknet, which solves the problem of accuracy drop caused by multi-scale feature loss during downsampling. Second, we proposed a method combining ECA and Ghost modules. In the process of feature fusion, the problems such as the increase of parameters, slow detection speed and repeated gradient calculation caused by too complex algorithm were solved. The ATT-YOLOv5-Ghost algorithm improves the detection accuracy by 4.6% compared with the baseline. The FPS can reach 64.9, and the computational amount is reduced by 8.9%. The algorithm complexity was significantly reduced.

AB We consider elections where the set of candidates is split into parties and each party can nominate just one candidate. We study the computational complexity of two problems. The Possible President problem asks whether a given party candidate can become the unique winner of the election for some nominations from other parties. The Necessary President is the problem to decide whether a given candidate will be the unique winner of the election for any possible nominations from other parties. We consider several different voting rules and show that for all of them the Possible President problem is NP-complete, even if the size of each party is at most two; for some voting rules we prove that the Necessary President is coNP-complete. Further, we formulate integer programs to solve the Possible President and Necessary President problems and test them on real and artificial data.

ID CONCEPT DRIFT; FRAMEWORK; EMERGENCE
AB Using norms to guide and coordinate interactions has gained tremendous attention in the multiagent community. However, new challenges arise as the interest moves towards dynamic socio-technical systems, where human and software agents interact, and interactions are required to adapt to changing human needs. For instance, different agents (human or software) might not have the same understanding of what it means to violate a norm (e.g., what characterizes hate speech), or their understanding of a norm might change over time (e.g., what constitutes an acceptable response time). The challenge is to address these issues by learning to detect norm violations from the limited interaction data and to explain the reasons for such violations. To do that, we propose a framework that combines Machine Learning (ML) models and incremental learning techniques. Our proposal is equipped to solve tasks in both tabular and text classification scenarios. Incremental learning is used to continuously update the base ML models as interactions unfold, ensemble learning is used to handle the imbalance class distribution of the interaction stream, Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) is used to learn from text sentences, and Integrated Gradients (IG) is the interpretability algorithm. We evaluate the proposed approach in the use case of Wikipedia article edits, where interactions revolve around editing articles, and the norm in question is prohibiting vandalism. Results show that the proposed framework can learn to detect norm violation in a setting with data imbalance and concept drift.

AB This paper presents a novel model, called ToMABD, that endows autonomous agents with Theory of Mind capabilities. ToMABD agents are able to simulate the perspective of the world that their peers have and reason from their perspective. Furthermore, ToMABD agents can reason from the perspective of others down to an arbitrary level of recursion, using Theory of Mind of n(th) order. By combining the previous capability with abductive reasoning, ToMABD agents can infer the beliefs that others were relying upon to select their actions, hence putting them in a more informed position when it comes to their own decision-making. We have tested the ToMABD model in the challenging domain of Hanabi, a game characterised by cooperation and imperfect information. Our results show that the abilities granted by the ToMABD model boost the performance of the team along a variety of metrics, including final score, efficiency of communication, and uncertainty reduction.

ID REVERBERATION
AB Implementing underwater sonar image denoising algorithms through unpaired clean and noisy images is feasible and meaningful, since compliant paired real underwater sonar data is nearly impractical. Nevertheless, acquiring high-performance denoising algorithm is challenging without pairs of data as learning objects. In addition, the wide domain gap between noisy and clean samples as well as the noise contained in underwater sonar images is significantly more complex than that involved in normal images. Therefore, directly utilizing current unpaired optimization algorithms (e.g. generative adversarial learning and circular consistency learning) in underwater sonar image denoising tasks is not sufficient to explore the essential connection from noisy inputs to clean outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unpaired sonar image denoising which probes the same features of unpaired samples through a dual contrast optimization approach in latent space, named as NCD-GAN. The designed algorithm is composed of two basic parts: Simultaneous Transition Structure (STS) and Separable Contrast Unit (SCU). Separately, STS adopts a cyclic structure of multi-domain transformation to generate valuable surface information, and mines potential feature distributions between different domains via the addition of bidirectional mappings. Meanwhile, SCU introduces additional constraints in layer domains to encourage closer background layers between adjacent domains, while increasing the distance between noise layers so as to better promote the removal of noise and assist in image restoration. Sufficient experiments confirm that our algorithm provides better performance than existing unpaired denoising algorithms on multiple publicly available sonar image datasets and exhibits excellent robustness in the processing of multiple noises. Compared to the latest denoising algorithms, there is at most a 26.43% improvement in the evaluation metrics. Furthermore, it gains a 22.75% mAP boost on the subsequent advanced visual tasks.

AB Breast tumor segmentation built on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a noteworthy phase for the quantifiable radiomics study of breast cancer. Manual tumor explanation is an inefficient method and encompasses medical associates, influenced, persuaded to error, and inter-user divergence. The quantities of contemporary preparations have exposed the competence of deep learning depictions in image segmentation. At this point, we designate a 3D Connected-AUNets for tumor segmentation from 3D MRIs built on encoder-decoder design. Owing to a constrained training dataset size, a generative adversarial networks channel is complementary to modernizing the input image itself to recognize the shared decoder and implement added controls on its layers. Based on the preliminary segmentation of Connected-AUNets, a fully connected 3D condition random field is used to improve segmentation results by determining 2D neighbor areas and 3D volume statistics. Furthermore, 3D connected components assessment is used to sustain around large components and reduce segmentation noise. The proposed system has been estimated on two regularly available datasets, apparently INbreast and the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography. The proposed system has also been evaluated using a private dataset. The experimental significances show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art processes for breast tumor segmentation.

AB Structural responses of bridges occur based on their structural characteristics and conditions. After the structural pattern is identified from the long-term measured response datasets, the structural responses can be evaluated and predicted using a pattern model. In the absence of significant variations in the structural condition, the difference between the predicted and measured responses is negligible. Otherwise, the differences can be identified, and this would be evidence of the variation in the structural condition. Therefore, the structural pattern model can be used effectively to investigate variations in the structural state and conditions. This study proposes an effective structural pattern recognition method using deep learning. A merged model is proposed by combining deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms to handle long-term responses from various sensors in the time domain and reflect statistical properties. Long-term (five-year) measured response datasets of an existing cable-supported bridge were used to validate the proposed method. According to the study, the proposed method can effectively identify the structural behavioral pattern of a cable-supported bridge.

AB Ensuring the reliability of face recognition systems against presentation attacks necessitates the deployment of face anti-spoofing techniques. Despite considerable advancements in this domain, the ability of even the most state-of-the-art methods to defend against adversarial examples remains elusive. While several adversarial defense strategies have been proposed, they typically suffer from constrained practicability due to inevitable trade-offs between universality, effectiveness, and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we thoroughly delve into the coupled relationship between adversarial detection and face anti-spoofing. Based on this, we propose a robust face anti-spoofing framework, namely AdvFAS, that leverages two coupled scores to accurately distinguish between correctly detected and wrongly detected face images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a variety of settings, including different attacks, datasets, and backbones, meanwhile enjoying high accuracy on clean examples. Moreover, we successfully apply the proposed method to detect real-world adversarial examples.

AB The increasing demand for video surveillance systems has led to a surge in research towards developing smart video surveillance systems that can combat the growing levels of insecurity. However, the massive amount of video data generated by these systems has overwhelmed the storage and processing capabilities of analytic applications. This paper proposes a fog computing-based smart video surveillance system that provides less latency, network bandwidth, and response time by localizing data to the edges of the network. The proposed system incorporates two key preprocessing steps, namely adaptive key frame extraction and adaptive contour-based background subtraction, to increase the quality of detecting abnormal motions from surveillance video streams. The adaptive key frame extraction mechanism extracts key frames from the available frames in the video sequence using a sliding window technique. The high-level semantic information of video frames is learned using the visual geometry group-16 Transfer Learning (VGG-16 TL) technique to better represent the video content. The adaptive contour-based background subtraction mechanism separates target foreground pixels from the background scenes, paving the way for easy detection of abnormal motions in the video frames. The proposed system leverages fog computing to process and store data, reducing latency and improving overall performance. The fog layer performs adaptive background subtraction, contour detection, and object analysis, ensuring timely processing of video frames and minimizing the need for transmitting large amounts of data to the cloud. The proposed system is evaluated using a real-time video dataset in terms of accuracy, compression ratio, precision, recall, processing time, latency, and network bandwidth, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed system for abnormal motion detection and data transmission. Overall, the proposed fog computing-based smart video surveillance system provides an effective solution for detecting abnormal motions in real-time institution video data with reduced latency, network bandwidth, and response time, demonstrating the potential of fog computing for video surveillance applications.
